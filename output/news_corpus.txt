Labour and employment secretary Sumita Dawra-led committee on enhancing female labour force participation in India is expected to submit its report this week, laying out a blueprint for the government and the private sector to hire more women.

The roadmap will have multidimensional recommendations focussing on targeted interventions to incentivise hiring of women, enable creation of adequate support infrastructure, enhance flexible work policies and put greater emphasis on skilling of women to prepare them for high-skill jobs, a senior government official told ET. The government intends to enhance female labour force participation in the country to 70% by 2047 as against 41.7% in 2023-24.

“Achieving the 70% workforce participation target by 2047 will require sustained efforts across multiple dimensions, such as strengthening childcare support, enhancing flexible work policies... and encouraging private sector diversity hiring through policy nudges,” the official said.

According to the official, there is a consensus at the highest level that for India to be a Viksit Bharat by 2047, the rate of participation by women should be on a par with the global rate and this could come in with targeted interventions only.

The global female labour force participation rate is over 50% compared to 80% for men.

The report could propose different working arrangements for the female workforce to enable them to manage the dual responsibility. Besides, it could list out a few sectors that are more conducive for women to work such as the care economy, among others. Further, emphasis would also be laid on creating a secure public transport and stay facilities for women around the workplace, enabling a safer and conducive work environment.

India Inc is staring at a huge shortage of artificial intelligence (AI) experts with only half of the demand getting fulfilled, according to the findings of a BCG report shared with ET.

This supply demand gap will persist with an expected shortage of 53% even by 2026-end, according to Ashish Garg, MD and senior partner, BCG India.

BCG’s ‘GenAI Adoption Conundrum’ report noted companies are currently investing up to 1.5% of their revenues in workforce learning and development to stay competitive, with the majority going towards upskilling employees on new technologies including AI. “Organisations should start by picking a few key use cases and demonstrating value before asking for larger investments,” said Garg.

Noting three roadblocks to becoming AI ready, Garg noted them as lack of leadership awareness, making organisational changes around structure and culture, and being able to deliver measurable results.

“While India has the largest STEM talent pool, companies still struggle to find AI specialists,” he said.

“If we zoom out and look at the next five years, AI is going to penetrate every aspect of human work, whether personal or business-related. As a result, the required skill sets will encompass almost every traditional business function,” said Tiger Tyagarajan, senior advisor at BCG.

The most significant skill gap lies at two ends of the spectrum, according to Tyagarajan. “First is the need for deep specialists in various AI-related domains; second, we need a broader workforce that can effectively use AI. The latter is the bigger challenge,” he said. The real challenge lies in getting the “plumbing” right, said Garg. “This is integrating AI into systems and workflows, which requires deeper, more specialised skills.”

Organisations must retrain their existing workforce, said experts. “Companies with 100,000 employees worldwide can’t rely solely on hiring new talent—they must also reskill their current employees,” said Tyagarajan.

About 1–2% of the knowledge workforce needs to be deeply specialised in AI. “This group will build solutions that others can use,” he said.

BCG research suggests that employees are open to AI adoption than employers realise. “Employees here in India are more willing to adopt AI-driven roles, but this also means that talent costs will continue to rise,” said Garg.

The top five countries in the world according to BCG that are pioneering AI include the US, Singapore, Mainland China, the UK, and Canada. “India, on the other hand, is what we classify as a rising contender in AI,” said Garg.

“While India is not yet at the level of these AI pioneers, this is exactly why everyone is rushing to India (due to availability of talent pool). In the long term, they have to leverage India, as they won’t be able to build everything in-house,” said Tyagarajan.

Two metrics—reskilling investment and revenue per headcount—are becoming strong leading indicators of a company’s success, as well as broader industry and economic trends, he said.



For India’s top 500 listed companies, BCG estimates over one million hours of training are needed for mid and senior-level management to integrate AI into business strategy, digital transformation, and agile methodologies.

The company is looking for professionals with skills in diverse areas including cloud computing, cyber security, Java Python, dotnet, Android/IoS development, and automation testing. The company is looking for people with a minimum of two years of experience.

The company had done a similar exercise in February and March last year, but those were walk-in recruitments at the development centres in Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad. The candidates, however, should not have appeared in the Infosys selection process in the past nine months.

The company has sent an internal communication about the proposed hiring, allowing the candidates to indicate the choice of their interview location, and the city where they would want to work if selected. Less than three years ago, the software giant had conducted such a recruitment drive virtually in Bengaluru as the city was coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Infosys did not respond to an email seeking its comment on how many people it planned to hire.

Sources, however, said the upcom ing recruitment was part of the company’s lateral hiring programme it conducts annually. Infosys had said earlier that it planned to hire 20,000 freshers next fiscal year, without disclosing a break-up between freshers and lateral hires.

The software giant has about 323,000 employees on its roster. The hiring drive would help the company fill up positions caused by attritions as well as the new ones that may have come along to support the ongoing and new projects.

With new hotel signings going up in remote locations, thousands of new jobs will get created in the hospitality sector in several small towns this year.

How are chains hoping to fulfil demand? By investing CSR funds on skilling and upskilling locals, and through reverse migration, enabling existing employees to move back to their hometowns, senior executives at leading hotel chains said.

Indian Hotels Company (IHCL) had last month signed a memorandum of understanding for India's largest hospitality skilling centre in Goa in partnership with the state's skills department.

“This will significantly support the thriving tourism ecosystem in Goa, providing opportunities for hospitality training in the state and neighbouring regions,” Gaurav Pokhariyal, executive vice president for HR at IHCL, told ET. “As we continue to expand our portfolio in tier-two and -three cities such as Jamshedpur, Nagpur and Kumbalgarh, we are focusing on skilling the local workforce,” he added.

Sanjay Bose, executive VP for HR, learning and development at ITC Hotels, said the chain’s expansion “into tier-two and -three cities presents significant opportunities for reverse migration.”

ITC Hotels also reached out to over 300 institutions last year for structured internship programmes covering over 5,000 students, Bose said.

Better work-life balance and lower cost of living are prompting many professionals to relocate to tier-two, -three locations, according to Vinay Jaswal, VP, HR operations (South Asia) and HR tech and analytics (APEC), at Marriott International.

Nikhil Sharma, managing director and COO, South Asia, of Radisson Hotel Group, said 50% of the workforce at its hotel in Saputara hill station in Gujarat have earlier worked in the metros. “We anticipate creating 3,000 new jobs across India, propelled by new openings in tier-two and -three markets. This expansion is enabling reverse migration, allowing skilled professionals to build careers in their hometowns,” he said.

Sharma said the chain’s partnership with the Tourism & Hospitality Skill Council (THSC) and The Job Plus is equipping young individuals with industry-aligned training.

Zane Dmello, director, HR, India, at Hyatt India Consultancy, said up to 31% of new team members are returning to their hometowns, depending on the location and stage of hiring.

Chains have looked at investing CSR funds on skilling in a big way, said Divya Krishan, VP, The Job Plus. “Brands such as Radisson Hotel Group and Chalet Hotels have come forward to ensure there is social empowerment alongside employability linked skilling,” she added. The Job Plus was founded by industry veteran Natwar Nagar and works on mobilising unskilled, raw candidates for the sector.

Mielle Batliwala, AVP, HR, at Sarovar Hotels, said given the chain’s expansion in various destinations, many senior professionals are choosing to return to their hometowns.

प्रधानमंत्री फसल बीमा योजना के अंतर्गत खाद्यान्न, तिलहन और वाणिज्यिक/बागवानी फसलें कवर की जाती हैं। सिर्फ उन्हीं ही फसलों का बीमा होगा, जो सरकार की ओर से मान्य है। क्या सभी किसानों के लिए फसल बीमा का प्रीमियम एक समान है?

हां, इंश्योरेंस की प्रीमियम दरें सभी किसानों के लिए एक समान हैं। खरीफ फसलों के लिए 2%, रबी फसलों के लिए 1.5% और वाणिज्यिक या बागवानी फसलों के लिए 5% फीसदी है। पीएम फसल बीमा योजना का क्लेम कैसे मिलता है?

अगर फसल को नुकसान होता है तो किसान को संबंधित बीमा कंपनी, बैंक या CSC के जरिए दावा करना होता है। क्लेम के साथ सभी जरूरी दस्तावेज और फसल के नुकसान का प्रमाण प्रस्तुत करना होगा। क्या किसानों के लिए फसल बीमा कराना जरूरी है

कभी बेमौसम बारिश तो कभी ओलावृष्टि..देश के किसानों को हर रोज अनगिनत चुनौतियों का सामना करना पड़ता है। कभी बारिश फसल को बर्बाद कर देती है तो सूखा किसानों की कमर तोड़ देता है। ऐसे में किसान अक्सर कर्ज के जाल में फंसते चले जाते हैं। मुसीबत में देश के अन्नदाता की मदद करने के लिए केंद्र सरकार ने कई तरह की कल्याणकारी योजनाएं शुरू की हैं। इन्हीं में से एक है प्रधानमंत्री फसल बीमा योजना।पीएम फसल बीमा योजना के तहत किसान अपनी फसल का बीमा करा सकते हैं ताकि प्राकृतिक आपदा आने पर उन्हें आर्थिक मदद मिल सके। पीएम फसल बीमा योजना क्या है, इसके लिए कितने पैसे देने पड़ते हैं, सरकार से कितनी सब्सिडी मिलती है? आइए जानते हैं इस लेख मेंप्रधानमंत्री फसल बीमा योजना (PMFBY) की शुरुआत 18 फरवरी, 2016 को प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी द्वारा की गई। इससे पहले चल रही राष्ट्रीय कृषि बीमा योजना की जगह इस योजना को लाया गया। इस योजना का उद्देश्य बहुत ही कम प्रीमियम पर किसानों को उनकी फसल को होने वाले नुकसान के एवज में बीमा देना है। प्राकृतिक आपदा, कीट प्रकोप और अन्य वजह से फसल को होने वाले नुकसान की स्थिति में यह योजना किसानों के लिए बहुत ही काम की साबित होती है।पीएम फसल बीमा योजना का प्रीमियम फसल की बुआई के अनुसार तय होता है। मसलन रबी के लिए तो खरीफ के लिए। इसी तरह बागवानी के लिए प्रति हेक्टेयर अलग प्रीमियम है। अपना प्रीमियम कैलकुलेट करने के लिए आपको पोर्टल पर पीएम फसल बीमा योजना कैलकुलेटर पर क्‍ल‍िक करना है। इसमें आपको फसल का मौसम और कितने हेक्टेयर जमीन है, ये चुनना है।

20 रुपये...आप सोचेंगे कि आखिर इतने पैसे में क्या आता है? टपरी पर चाय या समोसा! अगर हम आपसे कहें कि इन 20 रुपयों से आप आने वाली मुसीबत का डटकर सामना कर सकते हैं। महज 20 रुपये से भविष्य में बिना बताए आने वाली अनहोनी के वक्त 2 लाख रुपये की मदद मिल सकती है। जी हां, केंद्र सरकार की एक ऐसी योजना है, जिसमें 20 रुपये सालाना देकर आप 2 लाख रुपये का एक्सीडेंटल इंश्योरेंस ले सकते हैं। इस स्कीम का नाम है प्रधानमंत्री सुरक्षा बीमा योजना।भगवान न करे कि कभी कुछ अनहोनी हो, लेकिन अगर ऐसा होता है तो इस पॉलिसी से आप 2 लाख रुपये तक का क्लेम कर सकते हैं। किसी दुर्घटना में मृत्यु होने की स्थिति में परिजनों को 2 लाख रुपये मिलेंगे। यही नहीं अगर एक्सीडेंट में विकलांगता की स्थिति बनती है तो भी इस पॉलिसी के जरिए क्लेम किया जा सकता है। यह पॉलिसी क्या है, इसके क्या-क्या फायदे हैं और इसके लिए कैसे आवेदन करना होगा? आइए जानते हैं।देश में आर्थिक रूप से कमजोर लोगों के लिए किसी प्रकार की दुर्घटना के वक्त मदद करने के उद्देश्य से केंद्र सरकार ने प्रधानमंत्री सुरक्षा बीमा योजना की शुरुआत की। यह एक दुर्घटना बीमा योजना है, जो बहुत ही कम प्रीमियम में एक्सीडेंटल इंश्योरेंस देता है। इस योजना की शुरुआत 9 मई, 2015 को हुई थी। प्रधानमंत्री सुरक्षा बीमा योजना (PMSBY) के तहत महज 20 रुपये सालाना देकर 2 लाख रुपये तक का एक्सीडेंटल इंश्योरेंस कवर मिलता है। इस योजना के तहत हर साल यह राशि आपके आधार लिंक बैंक खाते से कट जाती है। अगर इंश्योरेंस लेने वाली व्यक्ति की दुर्घटना में पूर्ण विकलांगता हो जाती है तो 2 लाख रुपये इंश्योरेंस के तौर पर मिलते हैं। अगर बीमाधारक की मृत्यु हो जाती है तो परिवार को यह पैसा मिल जाता है।प्रधानमंत्री सुरक्षा बीमा योजना की शिकायत के लिए नेशनल टोल फ्री नंबरहै। अगर आप अपने राज्य के हेल्पलाइन नंबर को जानना चाहते हैं, तो नीचे दिए लिंक पर क्लिक करके पता कर सकते हैं।अगर आप इस योजना से बाहर निकलना चाहते हैं तो आपको बैंक को लिखित में देना होगा। यह काम आपको 1 मई से 31 मई के बीच ही करना होगा क्योंकि 1 जून को पॉलिसी रिन्यू हो जाएगी।PMSBY की पॉलिसी को रिन्यू करने के लिए आपको बस अपने खाते में किस्त का पैसा रखना है। 1 जून को पॉलिसी अपने आप रिन्यू हो जाएगी।अगर बीमाधारक के साथ कोई दुर्घटना हो जाती है तो आप जिस बैंक में आपने इंश्योरेंस पॉलिसी ली है, वहां से क्लेम फॉर्म लेकर और जरूरी दस्तावेजों के साथ उसे जमा करा सकते हैं। अगर विकलांगता की स्थिति है तो क्लेम का पैसा बीमाधारक के खाते में आ जाएगा। अगर बीमाधारक की मृत्यु हो जाती है तो क्लेम की राशि नॉमिनी को मिलेगी।नहीं, यह पॉलिसी सिर्फ अचानक हुई दुर्घटना में होने वाले नुकसान को कवर करती है। सुसाइड करने की स्थिति में कोई क्लेम नहीं दिया जाएगा।

He’s the brother of actor-model Rahul Dev. Vindu Dara Singh told SCREEN, “He was in depression after his mother passed away, he never let that go, was very close to his parents. ”

“He would feel alone, and then he would start on a drink and have gutka, then he wouldn’t stop. There was nobody to control him. He was such a wonderful guy and has done a fantastic job in Son Of Sardaar 2. Everybody will be clapping and laughing wheb he speaks, sadly, he won’t be there to enjoy that success,” added Vindu Dara Singh.

Actor Deepshikha Nagpal confirmed the news to SCREEN and said, “I was in touch with him. We were part of the same group, and whenever he came to Mumbai, we used to meet. He even came for my song launch. I still can’t believe this. Life is really so unpredictable. I woke up to this news and I’m still in shock. He was just 54. Such an amazing human being. I still can’t believe it. Krushna, Rajniesh, and I had done a film together with him, and we had such a good time. It’s just so sad.” Also read – Mukul Dev Death: Actor Mukul Dev dies at 54, Vindu Dara Singh recalls how ‘refused to step out’ after his parents death Actor Manoj Bajpayee also shared a heartfelt message on social media.

Kerala Ship Oil Spill: A Liberian-flagged container vessel, MSC ELSA 3, which had started tilting 38 nautical miles off the coast of Kochi on Saturday, has now completely capsized and is at risk of spilling oil, officials said Sunday. All crew members have been rescued.

Among the containers the vessel was carrying were 13 that contained what the Coast Guard said was “hazardous cargo” and 12 that contained calcium carbide.

The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority has issued an alert to the public to keep away from objects that may drift towards the coast.

According to the Indian Coast Guard (ICG), the vessel capsized rapidly in the early hours of Sunday “due to flooding in one of the holds”.

“All 24 crew members of Liberian-flagged container vessel MSC ELSA 3 were rescued safely, 21 by Indian Coast Guard and 3 by Indian Navy ship, Sujata, after the vessel sank off Kochi this morning. The vessel was carrying 640 containers, including 13 containing hazardous cargo and 12 with calcium carbide. Additionally, the ship had 84.44 metric tonnes of diesel and 367.1 metric tonnes of furnace oil in its tanks,” the Coast Guard said in a post on X.

The Coast Guard said it has activated comprehensive pollution response preparedness and is working in close coordination with the state administration to address all possible scenarios.

A Defence spokesperson in Kochi said the Navy and the Coast Guard are fighting to contain the oil spill. “On Saturday, 21 of the 24 crew members were rescued, and the remaining three were rescued on Sunday,” the spokesperson said.

The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, on Sunday said, “Based on hypothetical simulations, the spilled oil pollutant can reach the coastal stretch of Alappuzha, Ambalapuzha, Arattupuzha and Karunagappally within 36-48 hours of release. These coastal zones are at risk of contamination and should be given prompt attention to minimise potential environmental impact.”

SDMA member secretary Shekhar Kuriakose said the Chief Secretary has convened a meeting on Sunday to review the situation. “People have been told not to go near objects that are suspected to be from the sunken ship and are washed ashore. They should keep at least 200 metres away from such objects containing dangerous material. The Navy has informed that one km per hour is the approximate speed at which the containers will drift. The coastal regions of Ernakulam and Alappuzha have the highest possibility of getting the containers washed ashore,” he said.

INCOIS said it is closely monitoring the situation and remains in coordination with relevant authorities, providing vital ocean forecast information and advisory services to support ongoing search, rescue, and environmental response operations.

Soon after the tilting of the cargo ship was reported, INCOIS activated its Search and Rescue Aid Tool (SARAT) to assist in locating containers or drifting objects, it said. Additionally, ‘oil spill trajectory advisory’ simulations were run to forecast the potential spread and movement of any oil discharge, aiding mitigation and cleanup planning, it said.

‘Saksham’ engaged in oil spill response

The defence spokesperson in Kochi said the Coast Guard ship, Saksham, is engaged in oil spill response. In addition, a Coast Guard Dornier aircraft is being launched in “PR configuration for mitigating oil spill”. In the context of an oil spill response, “PR configuration” typically refers to the use of the ‘co-polarisation ratio’ (PR) method to assess the oil-water mixture ratio in a spill. This method helps determine the proportion of oil in an oil-water mixture, which is crucial for effective emergency treatment and cleanup efforts.

After the vessel tilted on Saturday, the shipping firm had brought another vessel to the area, and three crew members remained onboard the ill-fated ship as per instructions from the company. At one stage, the Indian Navy had explored methods to assist the ship to be taken under tow, so as to prevent further environmental damage. On Saturday, the ship, which had listed 26 degrees, did not report further listing and was in a state of equilibrium.

However, on Sunday, the ship started submerging further and more containers fell into the sea. Under this circumstance, the three crew members were taken onboard by INS Sujata, which was positioned very close to the now sunken vessel. Twenty one crew members are being brought to the Coast Guard jetty, and three others, including the captain and the chief engineer, are being brought to the Naval jetty in Kochi.

In his first “Mann Ki Baat” radio address since Operation Sindoor, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday praised the Armed Forces for its precision strikes on terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and linked the mission’s success to the power of the Made-in-India weapons.

“Our soldiers destroyed terror bases; it was their indomitable courage, along with the power of weapons, equipment and technology made in India,” Modi said during the monthly broadcast. “It also included the resolve of Atmanirbhar Bharat,” he added.

He added that there was an increasing sentiment among Indians to buy Indian-made toys for their children, plan domestic vacations and weddings and purchase gifts made by local artisans.

“Friends, this itself is the real strength of India – ‘connection between people and minds… public participation’. I urge all of you too… come, let us take a pledge on this occasion — wherever possible in our lives, we will accord priority to products made in the country. This is not just a matter of economic self-reliance… it is a feeling of participation in nation building. One step of ours can become a huge contribution to the progress of India,” he said.

Launched on May 7, Operation Sindoor was carried out by Indian armed forces targeting terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. According to PM Modi, the operation has sparked “new confidence and enthusiasm in the fight against terrorism,” and he praised the “precision and accuracy” with which India’s forces “destroyed the terrorist hideouts across the border.”

“The precision and accuracy with which our forces destroyed the terrorist hideouts across the border is amazing… Operation Sindoor is not just a military mission, it is a picture of our resolve, courage and a transforming India and this picture has infused the whole country with a sense of patriotism and has painted it in the hues of the tricolour. You must have seen that in many cities, villages and small towns of the country, Tiranga Yatras were organised,” he said.

He added that the whole nation was united against terrorism and resolved to end it.

The PM also highlighted the improvements in districts that were earlier ht by Maoist violence, including a village in Gadchiroli which has got a bus service for the first time.

“On account of the collective fight against Maoism, basic facilities have started reaching such areas as well. The people of the village say that with the arrival of the bus, their lives would become much easier,” he said.

Adani to Ambani: Sibal gets India Inc to pay Rs 50 crore for lawyers’ health cover

3 hr ago

Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, who has raised Rs 50 crore from a few big industrialists to fund a group medical insurance policy for the Bar’s members, has met with opposition from a section within the association. “As the new SCBA president, my first endeavour will be to discuss this policy in the Executive Committee meeting... My personal view is that this policy definitely needs to be renegotiated or scrapped, because the premium that we are paying for a Rs 2 lakh cover is highly disproportionate to the premium that we pay for a Rs 5 lakh cover,” Senior Advocate Vikas Singh, who was elected the new president of the Bar body last week, told The Indian Express. At a General Body Meeting of the SCBA on May 5, Singh had expressed his opposition. To a question on whether Sibal’s endeavour raised issues of conflict of interest, Singh said it depends on whether these are CSR funds. “There is no conflict if its not CSR funds as the money is given to the association and not to any individual,” he said. When contacted, Sibal said, “There is no conflict of interest here. Where is the question? The donation is to the association and not to any member. Moreover, personally, I have and may appear again against or in favour of many of these companies. And I charge them. Our professional career is not based on our friendships.” Sibal said Mukesh Ambani (Reliance Industries) contributed Rs 10 crore, while Anil Ambani (Reliance Group), Gautam Adani (Adani Group), N Chandrasekharan (Tata Sons), Samir Mehta (Torrent Group), G M Rao (GMR Group), Kumar Mangalam Birla (Aditya Birla Group), Anil Aggarwal (Vedanta) and Lakshmi Mittal (ArcelorMittal) gave Rs 5 crore each. He said corporates would get tax exemption under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. Donations made to specified institutions are allowed to be deducted from the taxable income under Section 80G. SCBA’s new President Singh said his attempt would be (to ensure) that this policy was made available only to needy members of the Bar or members who support elderly parents. “It should not be made available for people like us. The policy, as announced by the earlier Executive Committee, is meant for everybody, including me, Mr Sibal etc. This kind of money can never be utilised for that…All this will be done only after discussing with my Executive Committee.” According to Sibal, 95 per cent of lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court do not earn well. “They come from all over the country to Delhi…to practise…most of them are not earning well… they have to spend money on rent, their families… and if they fall ill, have to foot medical bills.” He said there are about 2,700-2,800 members of the SCBA who have voting rights, and will be eligible for the health cover. Addressing an event organised by the SCBA on May 21, Sibal explained how he went about raising the money. “I started sort of collecting from those who I have served for the last 52 years... I rang up Anil Aggarwal of Vedanta. He readily agreed and gave us a contribution of Rs 5 crore. I rang up Anil Ambani, a dear friend of mine, and he had no choice but to say yes. So he gave Rs 5 crore. I rang up the GMR Group, both Mr Rao as well as Mr Bhaskar Chandran... and they said, ‘Sir, now that you have asked, we will make sure that it happens’, and it happened, Rs 5 crore,” said Sibal. “I rang up Gautam Adani, and I said it’s time for you to contribute because you are more or less the emperor of India now and Rs 5 crore is too little for you. He said if you want more, I will give more, but here is Rs 5 crore. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” Sibal said. “Mr Kumar Mangalam Birla, again an old friend of mine... served the Birla empire for many years…never asked them for anything. So I said, another Rs 5 crore from you, and he said yes,” he said. “Then I rang up another friend of mine, Lakshmi Mittal from London. He picked up the phone and I made that request. He said somebody will get in touch with you soon. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” he said. “Then again, Mukesh Ambani. I knew Dhirubhai Ambani when I was a young lawyer and we had a very warm relationship…These boys were kids and they used to come to me and I used to do most of their matters in Bombay. So I asked him and he said how much do you want. I said Rs 10 crore. He said you will have the cheque soon. So he gave Rs 10 crore,” Sibal said. “Then I rang up Natarajan Chandrasekaran of Tata, whom I also know very well…and he also did not hesitate. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” the senior counsel said. “And from the Torrent Group, Mr Samir Mehta, again a good friend of mine, and, in fact, Dushyant Dave told me, if he doesn’t give it, let me know, I will make a call to him. But it didn’t really happen. I asked him, he gave Rs 5 crore... In this process, we have Rs 50 crore with us,” Sibal said. He also outlined what was done after raising the amount. “I contacted Apollo group, who are also my clients. I know the head of the family, head of the Apollo group is an old friend of mine. So I said look, we want you to handle this. He sort of looked at the market and got hold of a company called the National Insurance Company. And we started talking to the National Insurance Company as to what kind of benefits our young lawyers can get. I want to tell you… there is no insurance policy in this country that gives so many benefits as this one does,” he said. Chief Justice of India B R Gavai, who also addressed the event, congratulated the SCBA for raising Rs 50 crore. “Undoubtedly, this is a remarkable achievement that reflects deep concern for the welfare of the legal community,” he said. Pointing to the difficulties that young lawyers face with no regular income to meet their needs, the CJI said: “Providing good health insurance, therefore, is not just a welfare measure, it is a vital support system. It offers the lawyers a degree of financial security and peace of mind in times of medical need.”

Sanjay Kumar, 38, puts train travel in perspective — no romance of the rails, just pure strategy. “Agar aap dabdaba nahi dikhaiyega toh baithane ko bhi nahi milega (If you don’t show your might, you won’t even get a place to sit). This is the reality of the general class compartment.”

Sitting by an open window, legs folded, he says, “This time, I am lucky. I usually don’t get the window seat… I don’t even get to sit.”

Sanjay, a mechanic from Gopalganj in Bihar, is on board the Saharsa-Lokmanya Tilak Terminus Amrit Bharat, one of a series of 50 affordable express trains for general- and sleeper-class passengers that the government plans to run on routes that see high movement of migrant workers.

While the Saharsa-Mumbai train is the third Amrit Bharat express (after Darbhanga-Delhi and Malda-Bengaluru), it is the first in the Amrit Bharat 2.0 series – non-AC trains with upgraded facilities, which, the government says, will “provide affordable service and high-quality travelling experience for people in the lower-income and lower-middle-income category”.

The trains are part of the Railways’ larger Amrit Bharat project to modernise trains and railway stations. On May 22, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated 103 Amrit Bharat railway stations through video conference.

With 11 general coaches, eight reserved sleeper coaches, two second-class luggage-cum-guard coaches, and one pantry car, the Amrit Bharat trains promise to revolutionise the way much of India travels.

Kumar, who is on his way to Mumbai for an interview that he hopes will land him a job in the Middle East, says, “For AC class passengers, travelling can be a leisure activity. You can sit by the window and watch the passing landscape, but for us, most of the time, we barely get to move or look outside — the whole coach is so jam-packed. People often ask how we manage to travel in such conditions. The answer is simple. There is so much else to worry about that a difficult train journey of 24-48 hours seems normal.”

A sudden shower brings a cool draft into the coach and Sanjay, his left arm now wet from the rain that has splattered the open window, looks outside, smiling.

What’s new on Amrit Bharat 2.0 trains? What’s new on Amrit Bharat 2.0 trains?

Around eight hours ago, as the train, new and gleaming, stood on Platform No. 2 of Saharsa station, many had peeped in through the window bars of a general coach, incredulous. “Yeh toh AC-type train lag raha hai (This looks like an AC coach),” says Mithun Kumar Chaudhary, a mason from Samhar Khurd village in Bihar.

Instead of the usual worn-out blue seats and broken fittings were saffron and grey seats with air-spring suspension for passenger comfort, charging sockets with multiple ports, external emergency lights, radium-illuminated flooring strips, gleaming fans and an LED display with real-time information on the speed of the train and the next station. The train also has an emergency talk-back system in each of its coaches that allows passengers to communicate with the loco pilot.

The train had finally set off from Saharsa at 4.20 am for a 1,956-km journey that it would cover in almost 36 hours, stopping at 25 stations across four states.

Around 3.10 pm, minutes after the train crosses the Karamnasa, a tributary of the Ganga that marks the border between Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, it pulls into Deen Dayal Upadhyay Junction (earlier Mughalsarai). Boarding the general coach, Mukesh Singh whips off his scarf, wipes the shiny seat and looks around: “Yeh general coach hi hai naa, itani khali kaise hai, ye toh sleeper coach jaisa lag raha ha (This is a general coach, isn’t it? Why is it so empty? It looks like a sleeper coach),” Singh says.

Most long-distance trains have not more than four general coaches, as a result of which a 100-seat coach is often packed with an average of 300 passengers. But with 11 general coaches on this train, almost all passengers have a seat to themselves.

Singh is on his way to Goregaon in Mumbai, where he works as a tailor. “Mumbai has a lot of big buildings. Whenever I pass them, I wonder what must be going on inside those glass buildings. It’s the same with the AC class. Everyone looks so happy. Musafir woh bhi hain, musafir hum bhi hain, ek hi train mein hain, lekin hum dono mein zameen-aasman ka farq hai (People in AC coaches and us… We are both travellers on the same train, but there is a big difference between us). But at least on this train everyone looks equal,” he says.

With a sleeper class ticket between Saharsa and Mumbai for Rs 870 and a general class ticket for Rs 450, the fares on Amrit Bharat are competitive, say Railway officials. The sleeper class fare on the route is Rs 45 less than Humsafar Express and Rs 70 cheaper than the Saharsa-Lokmanya Tilak Terminus special.

Manufactured at the Integral Coach factory (ICF) in Chennai, Amrit Bharat 2.0 trains feature semi-automatic couplers instead of semi-permanent ones for easy attachment and detachment of coaches, and electro-pneumatic-assisted brake system for quick brake application. There are also external emergency lights to provide basic lighting during emergency situations such as derailments and accidents. Besides, the toilets have a vacuum evacuation system similar to that on Vande Bharat trains, toilet indicator lights and automatic hygiene odour control systems.

At 5.20 pm, the train reaches Prayagraj Cheoki station. A group of people huddle around Coach GS5, peeping in through the windows. They are headed to Mumbai, but many among them insist it’s not a general coach and are scared they’ll be fined if they board it. One of them, Mohammad Dilshad, finally walks up to a Railway Protection Force member to confirm, before the group finally boards the train.

“It’s hard to believe this is a general compartment. The seats are new, the coach is clean and there is running water in the toilet… there’s handwash too. How can this be a general coach? In the other trains, the upper berth would be so high that people would have to sit for 25-30 hours with their heads bent. Those seats are hard… Most of the time the fans don’t work. Luckily, not many people know about this train yet. Once they do, this may end up like all those trains,” says Dilshad, who works at a jeans workshop in Nallasopara, Mumbai.

Five years since the Covid-19 pandemic, while AC 3-tier has displaced the sleeper class to become the top passenger revenue generating class of the Indian Railways, the general compartments of long-route trains continue to retain their position as the second highest earning class of the national carrier.

According to the data available with the Ministry of Railways, in 2024-25, 236 crore or 32% of the total 737 crore passengers who travelled in trains did so in general class compartments.

As evening sets in and the train passes through Satna Railway Station in Madhya Pradesh, IPL cricket commentary blares out of several phones. Sumitra Devi walks out of one of the washrooms and can’t stop smiling, “I have never seen such a clean toilet. Toilet main log bhi nahi baithe hain… Yeh to pura AC coach lagta hain (There are no squatters inside the toilet. It looks like an AC coach),” says Devi, who is travelling with 11 of her family members.

It’s 6.20 am on Day 2 and the train now races past open tracts on the outskirts of Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh. Anzar Alam, a vendor from Darbhanga, makes the rounds of the coaches, his bucket filled with jal jeera, soft drinks and other beverages.

“In any train, the maximum earnings are from the general compartments. Since this train has 11 general coaches, it’s good for people like me,” says Alam.

Some 25 hours into the journey, Milan Patil, a ‘mechanical staff’, who does maintenance work on the train, steps out of one of the washrooms. “Some of the passengers are not using the push tap installed in the toilet and the wash basin. We have already got a complaint of a missing tap in one of the coaches,” he says, annoyed.

On the outskirts of Mumbai, the train slows down as it passes tall buildings and bustling markets.

At 4 pm on Day 2, the Amrit Bharat finally pulls into Platform No. 7 of Lokmanya Tilak Terminus. Nand Kishore Mukhiya and his family members – seven of them, all residents of Baijnathpur in Saharsa who work in a steel factory in Panvel – scramble to assemble their luggage.

“Yeh safar poora hua… Hum pravasi log sadak ki tarah hain. Isse guzarne waale log kahan se kahan pahuch jaate hain. Lekin sadak usi jagah bana rehta hai (This journey comes to an end… We migrants are like the road.

At 25 years, Gill is India’s youngest Test captain since Sachin Tendulkar, who was 23 when he helmed the team — and the fifth youngest ever, after Mansoor Ali Khan Patuadi (21), Kapil Dev (24), and Ravi Shastri (also 25, but 55 days younger).

While Jasprit Bumrah (31) has played the role of stand-in captain in the past, the selectors did not hand him the reins for the long term, citing “workload management”. Chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar confirmed on Saturday that Bumrah would not play all five Test matches in England.

With Ravichandran Ashwin hanging up his boots after the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar series in Australia last year, fast bowler Mohammed Shami ignored because of fitness concerns, and an inexperienced middle-order with two potential debutants — Abhimanyu Easwaran and Sai Sudharsan — Gill will have to shepherd the young team. Rishabh Pant (27) has been named as his deputy for the series.

Gill will have little time to settle in, as he will be tasked with making crucial decisions rightaway, including picking the opening partner for Yashasvi Jaiswal. Sudharsan and Easwaran, who would be expecting to earn their first India cap, will be in contention for the role along with K L Rahul.

Similarly, he will have to manage the bowling unit in Bumrah’s absence. Mohammed Siraj is expected to lead the attack in the matches where Bumrah does not play, with Akash Deep, Nitish Reddy, Prasidh Krishna and Arshdeep Singh being the other options.

Agarkar acknowledged the enormity of the challenge that awaits the young captain. “It is going to be as tough as it gets,” he said. “Maybe, he’ll have to learn on the job.”

Agarkar said the elevation of Gill — who made his Test debut five years ago and has scored 1,893 runs in 31 matches — as the captain of the 18-man squad was taken after seeing his “progress in the last year or two”. He also made it clear that the selectors didn’t want an interim captain, ruling out the other senior in the team, K L Rahul.

“You don’t pick captains for one or two tours. You want to invest in something that will help us going forward. Obviously, you discuss every option that’s there. Over the last year or so, we have looked at Shubman at various times. You take a lot of feedback from the dressing room as well,” Agarkar said in Mumbai after announcing the team.

“He’s very young. We’ve seen the improvement but we take feedback from a lot of people. Like always, it is a high-pressure job. But we’re hopeful we’ve picked the right guy,” Agarkar said.

While Gill’s promotion was expected in the aftermath of the void created by the absence of Kohli and Rohit Sharma, it also marked a drastic change in fortunes. Gill was in only three of the five matches in India’s last Test series in Australia, and didn’t play a knock of significance. He was on drinks duty for the third Test in Melbourne and got his place back only after Rohit sat out for the final Test in Sydney.

With only the experience of captaining India in five T20 matches against Zimbabwe last year, and leading Gujarat Titans in the IPL, he will have to steer the team through the next World Test Championship Cycle — a title that India has never won.

Gill hails from a farming family with roots in the border district of Fazilka in Punjab. Soon after the team was announced, the streets of Chak Kherewala, the cricketer’s village which is 16 kilometres from the border, were buzzing with pride. His family, however, confined themselves to their home, seeking privacy.

During the recent India-Pakistan conflict, the border village faced frequent blackouts, and the district headquarters witnessed drone activities. Author Deepti Babuta, mother of Olympian shooter Arjun Babuta, said it is “the struggles of border villages and their resilience which make players like Gill and Babuta”.

Eighteen years ago, Gill moved to Mohali with his parents and sister for better access to cricket facilities. Back then, the family was mocked. “People used to taunt them, saying who goes so far from home or spends so much time training for cricket,” recalled Gill’s paternal aunt Gurpreet Sandhu. “But then, somebody had to make the sacrifice. And both, my father and brother, did that. To see Shubman lead the Indian team will be the proudest moment for my father and brother.”

Gill, whose stars have been on the rise over the last few years, has used his fame and fortune to give back to the village. “He gave Rs 3.5 lakh last year for nets and other facilities. This is a big day for every child who trains here as it will inspire them,” said Gurpreet Singh, who runs the Jaimal Wala Academy on land earmarked by the village panchayat for cricket training.

There has been a constant uptick in the number of trainees, with “more and more parents sending their children”, according to Surinder Chhindi, secretary of the Fazilka Cricket Association. A new stadium, too, is being constructed near the village, he said.

Our political leaders shamed India last week. At the end of an ugly war that we fought and won, they could have shown grace and maturity befitting a democratic country. Instead, they made speeches and statements more befitting politicians in a tawdry autocracy. It was not just our political leaders who let the side down, but the media as well. Nearly all our private news channels turned their studios into war rooms. And celebrated TV anchors passed jingoism off as journalism.

Instead of investigating where the killers of Pahalgam have vanished, they wasted time expressing ill-informed opinions on national security. Some even became instant economists and questioned why the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had disbursed the next tranche of its loan to Pakistan. There was so much noise about ‘timing’ that the IMF had to remind us that these decisions are taken by the board. I have been in journalism for more than 50 years and have often been proud of how the Indian media has graduated seamlessly from press release journalism to holding the powerful to account and becoming a pillar of democracy. But last week, as I switched from one news channel to the next, I felt ashamed and embarrassed.

What was worse was that when I listened to the speeches and statements of the most important political leaders in India, I felt as ashamed and embarrassed. Let us begin with the Leader of the Opposition and the tone he set for his spokespersons. Rahul Gandhi has every right to question what happened in Operation Sindoor. He should ask why we have not yet traced the killers of Pahalgam. He should ask why it seems always that the identification of terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir happens after some horrific incident. Why never before an incident. He should ask why the Home Minister misled us into believing that terrorism had been crushed in Kashmir. He should ask why tourists had been encouraged to picnic in that unsecured meadow above Pahalgam. And there must be a hundred other questions to ask.

Opinion | Operation Sindoor has rewritten the rules of engagement in the Indian subcontinent

He chose, instead, to charge the Minister of External Affairs with leaking war plans to Pakistan and then went on to make the irresponsible charge that India agreed to a ceasefire under American pressure. His spokespersons followed their leader and went further. They appeared on TV debates to declare that India could have reoccupied PoK and destroyed Pakistan completely if Narendra Modi had not buckled under pressure from Donald Trump. Is Rahul Gandhi aware that the stand he has taken has been praised by Hafiz Saeed himself and publicly? The Congress party’s charges were ludicrous and should have been treated by our Prime Minister with the contempt they deserve. He chose instead to take the bait and make a speech that belonged more in a Bollywood film than on a serious political platform.

The dignified statesman who once told Vladimir Putin that ‘this is not an era for war’ disappeared and was replaced by a rabble rouser who ranted that it was no longer blood that coursed in his veins but ‘hot sindoor’. Instead of calmly stating India’s case and the reasons why we would be obliged to respond if there was more terrorism from Pakistan on our soil, he chose bluster and bombast. He declared that this was the new India, and this was a new kind of justice. Taking their cue from their ‘beloved Leader’, BJP spokespersons have not hesitated to charge the Congress party with speaking ‘the language of Pakistan’. Where does it get us when things like this get said in the highest echelons of Indian politics? The answer is that it brings India down to the level of the Islamist republic next door. It does nothing to solve the menace of jihadist terrorism we still face almost daily.

As I write these words, there are encounters with terrorists under way in Jammu & Kashmir, and there is no sign that this will change any time soon. So, are we going to have Operation Sindoor 2.0 soon? Or are we going to ask the men responsible for national security to explain why we always seem to be a step behind the jihadis? Why does this continue to happen?

As the daughter of a soldier, I spent most of my childhood in Army stations across India and developed a deep admiration for the Indian Army. It was in Army messes in obscure towns with names like Babina and Mhow that I met some of the finest men I have ever met. They were men who cherished honour and courage above all. Men who dismissed lightly the possibility of needing to die defending our borders. They considered it their job to give their lives for India.

There are still men like this in the armed forces and when politicians disrespect their service and turn it into a political soap opera, they dishonour their sacrifices. What we have seen in these past days since the end of the military engagement is a political soap opera of the tawdriest kind. We must hope that it stops soon and that our political leaders start behaving in a more dignified fashion. As for the media, it is time for TV anchors and reporters to remember that they harm India by constantly passing off jingoism as journalism. The job of journalists is to report what is happening. Not to beat war drums.

“I will not be able to sleep until I know where I am on it,” Shona said, referring to a “likeability code” that a few boys had designed to slot every girl in their class. “Where do I fit and how likeable do boys think I am?” was the hot topic among the grade VII girls in the school. I have to admit that earlier in the conversation, I had listened to her with incredulity, which slowly dissipated as I sensed her distress. It was important for me to acknowledge the pain before I attempted to deconstruct generations of patriarchy.

Fifteen-year-old Diya blames herself. “If only I had been thinner, prettier, it would not have happened,” she said, after her boyfriend cheated on her. Seventeen-year-old Chitra is dismayed at how she let her boyfriend “pressurise me to do things I was not okay with, but could not say no to. If I make a big deal of it, he will just call me a psycho, ghost me and slut-shame me in school.” And in all these conversations, what keeps coming up is the phrase “seeking male validation.” So rather than brushing this as a Gen Z slang, I became curious. The young generation has a way of coming up with terms that hit the nail on the head at times. These conversations define the cultural moment we are currently finding ourselves in.

Patriarchy is a shape-shifting beast. It morphs stealthily into the cultural context it finds itself. Nineteen-year-old Zoya told me how “yearning male validation” was making her question if she was pretty enough. Her body slumped, eyes fastened on her clenched hands; she was struggling to find words to express her pain. Her phone pinged and suddenly her face lit up. There was a big smile on her face. It was like a bulb being switched on in a dark room. “Male validation?” I asked her, and she smiled while rolling her eyes. “A boy I met on Bumble messaged me. It is so ridiculous, but it’s like I get a high. I feel so happy and confident every time I get a message from him,” she said.

I have also been very curious about dating apps. I am sure many have found love and romance through them but their politics is questionable. They are pitched as being sexually empowering for women. But in Zoya’s words, “Men come to window shop on these apps and women are on display. We are not the users, we are the products.” These dating apps perpetuate the validation economy where men are given the options to “pick and choose the right product”. “They have the playing field, and girls are being played.” Add to it the growing misogyny radicalising young men on the internet and we are left with quite an untamed beast that is being weaponised against women.

The injustice of it lingers and finds its way into my writing. That’s how I make sense of this world. How is it that despite decades of feminism, our girls are still outsourcing their worth by where they fit in the metric of “likeability” by males? And how the economics of diet, fitness, beauty industries, along with tech giants, are making young women more vulnerable to internalising this ridiculous notion. They are rewarded for every attempt they make to please men. Be smaller, take less space, stay silent, be pretty, be nice, be soft, be demure, be modest. Stay within the lines drawn out.

It is interesting to see that sexuality does not make us immune to it. “Women seek male validation, men seek male validation and maybe even queer folk seek male validation,” explained Zoya and it made perfect sense. Patriarchy does not spare anyone.

It delights me that it is young women who are unpacking the notion of “seeking male validation” and realising that something is off here. It is rancid and has gone way beyond the expiry date. In our conversations, some of the themes have emerged that could be starting points to help us find our way out of this smelly situation.

How can girls identify and name the problem when it shows up? When I asked this question, I got a range of responses that underlined how important it is to stay curious: “I ask myself why am I checking my phone repeatedly? Am I addicted to the dopamine kick that will end up hurting me later?” “Am I making myself small, soft, sweet to be more desirable to men?” “Am I okay with what is being said, or done here?” “Am I holding myself back from speaking up as I know the approval will be withdrawn?” “Where am I investing my attention, and am I letting it take over my life?” “Am I waiting to be chosen or am I ready to choose?”

Equally important is bringing up our boys to examine their privilege and the “boy code” that makes them feel entitled. They cannot be complicit in using patriarchy as a leash to make girls perform tricks.

It is interesting to note that across the world, the use of dating apps among women has dropped significantly compared to men. They are calling it what it is — economic exploitation in the garb of sexual liberation. I am also meeting more and more girls who are opting out of social media or prefer to use it intentionally.

As Diya said, “I am not okay being seen as a thirst trap.” To consume less and create more. To be doers rather than lookers. Chitra’s commitment to “Go big and go loud” is a heart-warming act of resistance. To speak up, question, take space.

To refuse to let the “likeability code” divide us. When we move beyond that tyranny, we find friendships and platonic love. Where all genders can come together for collective care.

For filmmaker Aparna Sen, her retro glasses reveal more than they conceal — her eyes looking for new words in her stories. For the last four years, she has been writing furiously, sometimes translating the modern poets of Bengal, at other times jotting down fragments of memories or a script she may never turn into a film. In between, she may be playing with her four dogs, cooking for friends and reading a poem by Russian poet Anna Akhmatova. Perhaps, she would have read her lines, “You will hear thunder and remember me, and think, she wanted storms.” Sen has kicked up many storms in her 79 years but would like to be known for her incandescent love for life.

“I am quite lazy now if you ask me,” she chuckles. “The two small dogs in Kolkata and the two big ones at my home in Shantiniketan are more than a handful. Writing happened during the Covid lockdowns, when I spent a lot of time reading poetry. And I thought to myself that while the world knew about Tagore because of English translations, Bengal’s modernist poets, who understood the alienation and anxieties of a post-colonial world, were not read elsewhere. So I got down to translating the poems of Sunil Gangopadhyay, Jibanananda Das, Shakti Chattopadhyay, Shankha Ghosh and Joy Goswami. I translated one poem every day with a missionary zeal,” says Sen, who continues to be an avid student of literature.

That’s perhaps partly because of her lineage (she is the niece of Jibanananda Das and daughter of film historian, critic and director Chidananda Dasgupta) and partly because of her immediate circle — her husband Kalyan Ray is an author and literature professor in the US, her friends are academics and daughter, actor-director Konkona Sen Sharma, is a voracious reader. “It’s not exactly a book club but we keep on sharing our reading lists and have discussions. Konkona suggests a lot of books,” says Sen, who has referenced Shakespeare in the Lear-like Violet Stoneham in 36 Chowringhee Lane (1981), and in Arshinagar (2015), a take on Romeo and Juliet against the backdrop of land mafia wars. Though she dropped out of Presidency College mid-course, her professor Kajal Sen Gupta always remembered her as the student who understood the grain of Shakespeare. “I was deeply inspired by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Spanish surrealism. That’s the reason I have added some elements of magic realism in my films too,” says Sen.

The reading circle was where she chanced upon filmmaker Suman Ghosh, an economics professor by profession and a filmmaker by passion. Familiarity grew into friendship with Sen finally agreeing to be the subject of his documentary, Paroma: A Journey with Aparna Sen, which released this January. The documentary was screened recently at the Habitat Film Festival in Delhi, where Sen looked back at some of her work. “I think she embodies the rare breed of Bengal’s fiery and free-spirited liberals who can own both their Bengali and Western identities with elan and articulate in both languages. That refinement is fast fading,” says Ghosh.

A WOMAN’S VOICE

Although she was introduced to films by Satyajit Ray as a child bride who adults into a young woman in Teen Kanya (1961), Sen was practical enough to understand that she couldn’t sustain a career without going mainstream. “I had huge commercial success and have no regrets because it got me to a place where I could think of owning my voice. But I was frustrated by stereotypes,” says the filmmaker, who has won nine national awards as director. Yet the glamorous star avatar was to be the biggest impediment in her journey. As filmmaker Srijit Mukherji admits, “She was my first crush and inspired my celluloid dreams with her aura and charisma. Not that she was a brilliant actress but there was something about her mannerism that added to her charm. I didn’t realise she was so sharp as a director till I became her assistant.” Actor Sujoy Prasad Chatterjee calls her the disruptor because she brought in “middle class intelligentsia to commercial cinema, which did not have a space for such personalities.”

However, typecasting stifled her. As her long-time friend and theatre legend Sohag Sen says, “Everybody saw her external beauty but she has such depth, a voice and moral fibre that she could have given much more to acting.” Theatreperson Chaiti Ghoshal, who played Rakhee Gulzar’s daughter in Parama (1985), wonders why big directors failed to realise that she could deconstruct herself. “She has a brilliant eye for detail, is alert, observant and does her research,” she says. Even Ray himself never used her perceptive finesse to push her as an actor. Yet in Paromitar Ek Din (2000), where she plays a TV-watching, conformist housewife of humble origins, she breaks out of the urban mould that everybody had boxed her into.

That’s why she never chased stardom in the Hindi film industry unlike her peers — Sharmila Tagore, Rakhee Gulzar and Moushumi Chatterjee. She returned to Bengal and then directed Rakhee and Moushumi in her seminal works Parama and Goynar Baksho (2013), gifting them their memorable characters in the process. She even congratulated Tagore for letting go of her barriers as an actor in her latest film Puratawn (2025). “Self-believing, yes but she has a really warm heart and wouldn’t judge or hold a grudge against anybody,” says Sohag Sen.

What she could not get herself, she gave egolessly to other actors. Long-time friend and actor Shabana Azmi testifies that Sen loves her actors so much that she herself looks for every opportunity to work with her. “She is so meticulous about her frame that she will get on a chair to drive a nail in the wall. She knows the layering of each emotion. And much before colour-blind casting, she cast actors from different geographies. She even made me sing Rabindrasangeet in Sonata (2017). And she got all this done with her quaint English,” laughs Azmi. Actor-producer Rituparna Sengupta doesn’t mind the rigours of Sen’s acting workshops or her trial and error approach. “She chiselled me as an actor but my takeaway is her self-starter spirit,” she says.

As a director, Sen let her women protagonists explore the full arc of human experience, from isolation to desire and individual agency. Sen wrote 36 Chowringhee Lane, which continues to be a defining lament of urban loneliness in a rapidly changing world of values, at the height of her stardom. She took it to Ray, who encouraged her to make it and suggested Shashi Kapoor be the producer. “Ray was the first to give women a voice. I love Mahanagar (1963), where the protagonist takes a stand for a colleague at work and resigns protesting her unjust firing. This when her husband is jobless. That ethical core shook me,” says Sen, who put everyday women front and centre. In the process, she has broken patriarchal tropes bit by bit, preparing her audience.

In Parama, the woman recognises her desire and her sense of being through an extra-marital relationship because she wasn’t allowed to find what she wanted in the confines of a marriage. That a relationship could be a transient tool of self-discovery wasn’t received well initially. “It was 1985, I faced a lot of criticism for allowing a married woman sexual choice. But it became a hit. Elderly women came up to me quietly and appreciated that somebody could hear them. Paromitar Ek Din explores female friendship between a mother-in-law and her former daughter-in-law, a fiercely contested space conventionally. And in Goynar Baksho, it is about unblocking the capital assets that women hoard mindlessly. The ghost of the grand-aunt lives her dreams of entrepreneurship through her grand daughter-in-law by asking her to use her jewels for business,” says Sen. In that sense, she has bent gender identities. At the same time, women have not always been high priestesses in her films. In fact, in Yugant (1995), it is the male protagonist who is the moral core, questioning the naked ambition and unprincipled choices of his wife.

The fact that all of Sen’s protagonists are relatable is because she dips into lived experiences around her, be it her friends, even acquaintances. “My life is a school,” she says.

THE ACTIVIST

When the RG Kar rape and murder case upended Kolkata and got its citizenry out on the streets last year, Sen led from the front. “At 79, she climbed atop a truck and addressed protesting junior doctors, offering to seek the intervention of the chief minister on their behalf,” says Ghoshal.

However, Sen was trolled and misunderstood for taking on a regime that she had been sympathetic to in the past. Few understood that she was speaking up for common people trapped in between. “She is beyond politics and sought justice as an aware citizen from the right authority, regardless of whether she had supported it once or not. Unlike many from the land rights movement, she didn’t become part of the government’s machinery or seek favours. That’s why her voice is the loudest and freest,” says Ghoshal.

In fact, Sen has a humanistic approach to the impact of socio-politics on people. Unfortunately, finding the middle ground is difficult in a polarised world. However, she never lets her whole-hearted street fighter mode take over her films though they certainly shape their backdrop and context, perhaps more sharply now. “My films cannot become a platform for political sloganeering but I am impacted by all that is around me. Yes, there was an innocence in the beginning but then as you mature, you become more conscious of the inequality, injustice and communal disharmony around you,” says Sen. That’s how Mr and Mrs Iyer (2002) happened where a man and woman of different faiths end up saving each other at a humanistic level. Ghawre Bairey Aaj (2019) reflects the contemporary social reality where the Dalit protagonist is caught between liberalism and Right wing politics. And in Yugant, the marital discord becomes a metaphor for the man-nature conflict. “The ocean itself goes afire with an apocalyptic end. We did that before tech aids became available. Imagine what it would be now,” says Sen.

However, it is The Rapist (2021), which was awarded at the Busan International Film Festival in 2022, that pushes the levels of comfort. In her first full-length Hindi feature film, where she reunites with daughter Konkona, she takes off from the Nirbhaya rape case in Delhi. It analyses how boys, who are not born criminals, turn rapists and whether a pro-life choice should be made by the pregnant survivor. It is because of this disturbing complexity that the film awaits a theatrical release.

FINDING SPOTLIGHT

But for all her “thinking” films and unpeeling of human relationships to their rawest, basest level, Sen never got the international recognition she deserved. This despite coming ahead of Mira Nair and Deepa Mehta. That’s partly because she has been a poor archivist of her work, says Ghosh who had a tough time getting rights and original film reels from her producers. “She never marketed herself. Even Ray and Mrinal Sen would send word out at film festivals before they had finished shooting their films. Sen never projected herself that way,” he says.

The filmmaker herself admits that her producers didn’t own her works the way French producers pushed Indian indie efforts like The Lunchbox (2013). “If the producers are putting their money, they should believe in their films, push them and reclaim costs. Also, I didn’t have agencies or advisors to represent me. And there was zero marketing. One of the film festivals wanted The Japanese Wife (2010) as the opening film but the producer felt it needed more cuts, the entry was dated and so on. An opening film spot gets you exposure, critics, producers and distributors. The Tokyo film festival wanted it too, but the producers let it go,” says Sen. Of course, the festival dynamics work differently too. “There’s a ‘flavour of the season’ scenario. So it could be a phase of Chinese or Korean films, with their best work being pushed at all levels. India also made good films but they didn’t get that reception, appreciation or opportunity. Of course, French films never went out of fashion,” reasons Sen. Auteur filmmakers like Sen have a tough time getting producers, who like to get a Bengali film wrapped up in 15 days to keep costs down as the returns are paltry. “We thought OTT would give our kind some space but even that medium has fallen back on mainstream fare and crime series. Where do I go then?” she asks.

I AM EVERY WOMAN

Sohag Sen feels that most people misread Sen because of her idiosyncrasies and straight talk. Some judge her for her three marriages and never consider that she has given stability to both her daughters. “She is all heart at home and a very organised homemaker. She is a fabulous cook and has done her home interiors very tastefully; she defined ethnic chic. She always says ‘sorry’ and ‘thank you,’ to everybody,” she says. Ghoshal remembers how she was a hands-on mother, supervising her elder daughter’s studies and homework in between shoots, ensuring she did not waste food and carrying Konkona in her lap on the sets while shooting for Parama.

Konkona recalls how her mother wasn’t indulgent at all and prevented her from watching TV epics lest they stunt her imagination. Instead she inculcated the habit of reading in her. “But when it comes to work, Konkona says we are comrades, sharing and bouncing off each other as equals,” says Sen.

So will there be an autobiography of a life well-lived or a compilation of her translations? “Ke jaane, dekhi (Don’t know, let’s see),” she says. That is the actor’s vulnerability, the one that still believes it is evolving.

The law is reason-free from passion, said Aristotle, and perhaps in courts and codes, in clauses and contracts, that may be true. But life, real life, isn’t lived in logic. Life is lawless, lush, lyrical. It is not sculpted by syllogism, but sung in the shrill, sweet, startling song of the heart. It is not governed by gavel and verdict, but by the vagaries of memory, the weight of a glance, the warmth of a word whispered at the right moment—or the wrong one. Passion, not reason, is the pulse of living. Love, not logic, is the fire that forges us.

I have found this not in philosophy’s pages, but in the kitchen, in conversations, in the quiet chaos of ordinary days. Life reveals itself not through conclusions but through chutneys and chattels, through laughter laced with longing, through the smell of ghee rising from a hot paratha, through the tired thump of feet finding rest at dusk. Some of my deepest truths arrived unannounced, like mangoes in May—golden, ripe, rich with memory. They came softly, like the smell of sandalwood curling through a summer courtyard, like my grandmother’s hands rubbing mustard into mangoes for pickles that would outlast the season and carry stories in their salt.

She taught me everything I know about timing—not the timing of to-do lists or calendar reminders, but the tempo of trust, the pace of patience, the lull before the sizzle. In her hands, recipes were rituals, and rituals were revelations. Her food wasn’t about flair; it was about feeling. It was about listening—to the lentils, to the silence, to the soul. Her roti puffed not from perfection, but from presence. She taught me to wait, to watch, to wonder. That the dough must rest before it can rise. That the dal must bubble before it can bloom. That the heart, too, must be held—gently, generously, and often in silence.

And yet the world we live in rarely honours that silence. It rushes. It races. It demands deliverables, not devotion. It celebrates speed over stillness. In the world outside my grandmother’s kitchen, people sharpened their sentences and trimmed their tenderness. They advised ambition, not affection. They spoke of professionalism as if it were purer than passion. They said: don’t take it personally. But what else is there to take personally, if not life? A half-eaten meal. A missed call. A forgotten birthday. A friend who moves on without mourning. A city that swallows you without a second glance. The small slights that settle like dust in your chest and make you ache quietly.

We are taught to toughen. To harden. To grow up. To not feel too much. But when did numbness become noble? When did detachment become a discipline? We learn to hide our hunger. We silence our softness. We wrap our yearning in routines. We pretend we don’t need to be seen, to be soothed, to be held. But we do. Even the strongest among us do. Especially the strongest.

There was a time when I thought success was measured in the magnitude of moments—in the awards, the applause, the adrenaline of achievement. But the more I lived, the more I saw that meaning was made in the margins. Not in the limelight, but in the lingering. In the way someone pours you chai without asking. In the way you hum a tune while chopping coriander. In the way a dog waits by the door even when you’re late. In the way sunlight slices through a curtain and lands on the same spot of your dining table day after day, faithful and forgotten. These are the small things that stitch us together. The simple things that save us.

I have sat in fancy rooms. I have spoken on big stages. I have fed strangers in cities I can’t remember. But nothing has moved me more than the way my mother would fold my shirt sleeves before a journey. Or how my father, rarely vocal, once left me a note with a single line: “Come home when you’re tired.” There was more warmth in that sentence than in a thousand congratulatory claps. More healing in its hush than in all the hurried happiness the world waves in your face.

Fulfillment is not a frenzy. It is not fame. It is not followers. It is that fleeting yet full feeling of fitting in your own skin. It is peace in the pantry. Joy in the jhaadu. Grace in the grind. It is in growing a tulsi plant and watching it wilt and watering it anyway. It is in giving without guarantees, in working without applause, in loving without insurance. It is in chopping onions and not minding the tears. It is in waking up and walking to the kitchen and making tea even when your heart is heavy.

I’ve learned that living well is not about getting ahead, but about going deeper. Digging into the day like you would into a bowl of biryani—knowing there are layers. Saffron and secrets. Spice and sorrow. Softness under the surface. You cannot skim through it. You have to sit with it. Stir it. Stay.

To live deeply is to refuse the shallows. It is to risk ruin for the sake of realness. It is to love with your whole heart, knowing it may break. It is to show up—tired, trembling, tender—and still offer your best. Not because the world deserves it, but because you do. Because giving is its own grace. Because effort is sacred. Because sincerity is strength.

And yet we forget. We fall for the filtered life. The curated calm. The illusion of invincibility. But real life is rarely photogenic. Real life is messy. It is bhindi that burns. It is shirts stained with sambhar. It is missing someone who may never come back. It is forgiving someone who never said sorry. It is choosing to stay when leaving would be easier. It is fighting with someone and still making their favourite aloo for dinner. It is holding space even when your own feels hollow.

It is not easy. But it is everything.

Because love, not law, is what lifts us. Not the love in songs or stories, but the everyday kind. The workday kind. The Wednesday evening kind. The love that looks like making a to-do list for someone else. Like checking if the geyser’s on. Like leaving the last piece of cake. Like noticing. Like remembering. Like trying, again and again, even when you’re tired.

And so, I no longer chase meaning in the marquee. I find it in the mundane. In the unspoken. In the unsaid. I find it in the crackle of curry leaves. In the way rice rises when rinsed. In the comfort of a cracked cup that still holds chai. In the resilience of a heart that’s been hurt but still hurries to help.

Maybe that’s what living is. Not grand gestures, but grounded grace. Not perfect planning, but presence. Not always winning, but always wondering. Maybe we are here not to be remarkable, but to be real. To be raw. To be receptive.

Because in the end, what remains? Not the riches. Not the resumes. Not the rational. But the rhythms we shared.

Running parallel to the story on the fragility of friendship in the suspense drama Pune Highway is the steadfast camaraderie and collaborative ties of its creators. Bugs Bhargava Krishna and Rahul daCunha — the film’s co-writers and co-directors — have worked together for nearly four decades on advertisements and theatre projects. Now they have joined hands to adapt Rahul’s 2004 play Pune Highway. “It’s a real test of friendship when you work together and still remain friends. We passed,” says Bhargava.

Rahul and Bhargava belong to a diminishing tribe of Mumbai-based advertising professionals who devote their evenings to making plays. While Bhargava crossed over to films — he acted in movies such as Taare Zameen Par (2007), Kaminey (2009), Delhi Belly (2011), A Suitable Boy (2020) as well as directed Barot House (2019) and Nail Polish (2021), theatre kept Rahul occupied. Bhargava, who was part of the original cast of the play Pune Highway, always believed “there was something cinematic” in its narrative, and nudged Rahul to make the movie.

Nearly three years ago, they embarked on adapting Pune Highway into a screenplay. It follows the story of Khandu, Vishnu, Nicky, Natasha and Babu, who grew up together in Shantibhavan, a building in Mumbai. Even though an incident on the Pune highway makes Babu a paraplegic, the life of these Shantibhavan residents goes on until one day a body is fished out of a lake, away from the city. As the investigation into the case continues, the friends find themselves grappling with past secrets and new realities.

Though the play was written and directed by Rahul, the film, he says, is a product of their joint vision. “Our main concern was how we would write for the film. What do we keep and what do we let go of? In the end, the characters gained depth and the narrative became visually exciting,” says Rahul.

In theatre, the story usually progresses sequentially. The shooting of Pune Highway, however, began with its climax. “We had only three readings before the shoot. So, it was challenging for the actors to stay with the sequence that was being shot that particular day,” says Rahul, whose agency daCunha Communications helms the Amul Butter topical campaign.

It has been a three-year journey to the theatres. “Once a play is ready, we open it. However, there is a whole journey after a film is ready — promotion planning, releasing its teaser, getting the trailer ready and so on. This is where our experience as ad professionals comes to the fore,” says Rahul, who has written several popular plays, including Class of ‘84 (2003) and Me, Kash & Cruise (2008).

This writer-director duo will soon be shifting their focus to adapting a literary work for the screen. The film will be based on the first story in Old Cypress And Other Stories (1991) by Rahul’s mother Nisha daCunha. It explores the complexities of family, identity, and cultural heritage. When Bhargava read it, he was keen to develop the story, titled Old Cypress, a haunting story about finding life and confidence after love ends. “We are excited to create a visual style that is different from Pune Highway. It is a woman-centric story that looks at what we go through in our 40s and 50s,” says Bhargava.

Rahul and Nisha had their doubts about its cinematic adaptation. Bhargava, who stuck to this idea, crafted the screenplay, with Rahul making additions to heighten the drama and conflict. “Now I am familiar with what is required when a story transitions from stage to screen. The process of book to screen is more complex,” says Rahul.

It’s a playbook that keeps repeating itself and instead of leaning from it, we keep patting ourselves on the back after every SOS ‘success’. First we let some magnificent mega-fauna teeter on the edge of extinction and then launch a rescue mission at the last possible moment.

In around 1880 there were just about twelve Asiatic lions left in the country — in Junagadh, Gujarat when the Nawab of Junagadh finally forbade all hunting and the dozen were safe in his private hunting preserve. British colonial hunters along with Indian nobility had hunted down every last lion in the rest of the country and they were to be found all over the place. Thanks to protection, those dozen lions have increased their numbers to over 650 animals — surely a success story, but again, they are all too closely packed together and diseases can flare up and take them down. Canine distemper had taken down nearly 25 lions in 2018 (it killed over 1000 animals in the Serengeti). Again, we have the warnings and are ignoring them (Gujarat refuses to let its lions go to other states), so are we going to have to run around flapping our hands if some virus goes berserk among these big cats?

The last three Asiatic cheetahs were accounted for in 1947 by the then Maharaja of Korea (now in Chhattisgarh) and now we’ve had to import them from Africa and are patting ourselves on the back because they’re producing cubs galore — all ‘made in India’!

There were 40,000 tigers at the turn of the century, a figure that plummeted to 4,000 after Independence due to wholesale hunting, and before the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 came into force and Project Tiger was launched. Even so, numbers dropped (chiefly due to poaching) to just over 1400 between 2002 and 2008, before the alarm was sounded yet again and we had to scramble.

What’s worse — even when whistle-blowers sound the alarm, they are the ones to be persecuted and turned out of their study areas by officials. Warnings that there were no tigers left had been given in Panna and Sariska, which po-faced officials denied. They kept increasing the census numbers every time one was conducted, until the truth emerged. Both places had zero or near zero tigers – all thanks to poaching. Now of course we are patting ourselves on the back because tigers relocated here from Ranthambore and other reserves have been breeding well in these erstwhile bankrupted places. Wonderful!

We allowed Indian rhinoceros numbers to sink as low as 100 in the early 1900s (according to the International Rhino Foundation) before scrambling to provide them with Z quality security. At one time there were just 12 animals left in that rhino stronghold — Kaziranga. They’ve done very well since, and no doubt earned us many hosannas for saving them, but why on earth can’t we see the writing on the wall well before we’re just about to hit it?

Then there’s the Great Indian Bustard: once common in the grasslands and scrublands of India, now in critical condition, with just over 100 birds left. We know well the causes for their decline — habitat destruction, transmission lines, solar panels in their territories. Now we have had to take recourse to that last ditch conservation strategy: captive breeding. And we’re so thrilled that that seems to be going well, but I guess we must be grateful for small mercies.

The stubby little Pygmy Hog of the Northeast, teetering on the edge of extinction, has similarly had to be caught and bred in captivity. Small numbers have been released back into the wilds of their home environment such as the Manas National Park.

It’s true that in some cases, it is difficult to see a crisis looming. No one really knew how deadly Diclofenac — an analgesic introduced in the early 1990s for livestock — would be to vultures and we only realised that something evil was afoot when over 99 per cent of these birds with iron stomachs died, after ingesting the carcasses of livestock that had been vaccinated with it. Even so, it took until 2003 before the culprit was identified and banned. So it was emergency stations for the vultures too — captive breeding, the opening of vulture ‘restaurants’. Now, very slowly they seem to be recovering.

But by and large we always unnecessarily tend to let a situation get out of hand before going into SOS mode, and all too often, in the face of warnings being sounded well in advance. In a war, when the air raid sirens go off — you scuttle underground immediately, you don’t wait for the bombs and missiles to explode before running helter-skelter.

So far we’ve been lucky in that we have managed to ‘save’ so many species of large and charismatic fauna — the tigers, lions and rhinos — and have been commended for this by the international community. But are we heeding warnings given even now?

There’s a monstrous ‘development’ project being planned in the Nicobar Islands which will cause deforestation and destruction on an epic scale. Will this put the endemic Nicobar pigeon, Nicobar megapode and others in dire straits? (Not to mention the tribals that have lived there for eons). Will we only wake up when there are single digit numbers of these birds (and people) left? With an endemic species, there’s really nowhere to relocate them — the Nicobar pigeon can hardly be made to resettle in a Gurugram high-rise!

At 70, artist Arpana Caur is charting new creative paths while reflecting on her five-decade artistic journey. One of India’s leading contemporary painters, known for her evocative, figurative style and layered spiritual and social narratives, she has spent the past year curating four new permanent galleries at the Academy of Fine Arts and Literature in New Delhi, founded by her mother and author Ajeet Cour. These additions bring the total to seven galleries, showcasing her collection of Indian miniatures, folk art, her own works across mediums and a dedicated space honouring Ajeet Cour’s literary legacy.

Could you talk about the new permanent galleries?

We had been envisioning these galleries for some time but the project gained urgency after last year’s floods in Delhi, when several works in our collection were damaged due to water seeping into the premises. The gallery dedicated to my mother features handwritten manuscripts of many of her books in Gurmukhi, including her autobiography Khanabadosh. It also showcases her archival photographs, memorabilia and awards.

Designed by architect Gautam Bhatia, the two galleries housing my work are built around the design of ‘forests’— encouraging visitors to wander through a maze of panels that trace my artistic practice. Among the works on view is the very first painting I made at the age of nine, inspired by an Amrita Sher-Gil work. These are works I kept with me over the years, and now want to share with a wider audience.

Another gallery showcases your collection of miniatures. How did this collection come together?

I’ve always been drawn to miniatures. As a child, I cherished weekend visits to Sapru House for children’s films and to the National Museum, where my mother, sister and I would spend hours studying miniatures. As soon as I began selling my own art, I started collecting miniatures. In 1980, I traded my painting Mother and Daughter for Pratapaditya Pal’s Court Paintings of India published by Kumar Gallery, as I couldn’t afford it otherwise. That work later sold for Rs 9 lakh at an auction. Over the years, I exchanged several of my paintings for miniatures, including a collection of Sikh miniatures I acquired from MS Randhawa’s nephew in Delhi. I made a conscious effort to collect works from different schools, with Pahari and Persian miniatures being the oldest.

These miniatures have also deeply shaped my own work. For instance, I incorporated architectural elements from Basohli miniatures and used their vibrant colours to divide my canvases. I also borrowed the concept of Narikuncher from Persian miniatures, where several figures form a unified composition. A Sikh miniature that depicts Guru Nanak with Bhai Lalo, who earned his living by honest work, became the basis of my canvas Sachcha Sauda (2010).

In your childhood, what were the influences that shaped your artistic journey and what inspired you to pursue art?

Story continues below this ad

As a child, I learned to play the sitar, I wrote poetry but painting brought me the greatest joy. Our neighbour, Surinder Chadha, was a graphic artist and I would spend hours at his studio asking questions. We had a library full of books and writers such as Shiv Batalvi, Amrita Pritam, Krishna Sobti and Khushwant Singh often visited it. From the age of seven, I studied Gurmukhi and immersed myself in Punjabi literature as well as the works of Sufi poets like Baba Farid and Bulleh Shah.

Inspired by my mother, I initially aspired to be a teacher but she encouraged me to follow my passion for art. Despite studying English at Lady Shri Ram College, I continued painting with no formal training. In 1974, I participated in two group shows in Delhi — one organised by the German Embassy and another curated by MF Husain. Bhavesh da (Sanyal) encouraged me to plan my first solo show in 1975, and the rest followed. In 1979, I received a scholarship for an advanced course in painting at St Martin’s School of Art in London but I was so homesick that I returned after two months.

You have depicted the trauma of Partition and the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in your works. Could you talk about that?

Although I didn’t witness the Partition first-hand, I felt its pain through the stories of my grandparents and mother. We still read the Guru Granth Sahib that my maternal grandfather brought with him when he fled Lahore in 1947.

The 1984 genocide, however, was something I experienced. Living in Neeti Bagh, I remember seeing clouds of smoke rising from South Extension. A taxi stand near our house was set on fire. Our landlord took us to court, claiming my mother, Ajeet Cour, a ‘prominent sardaarni’, would make his house a target. We were forced to leave. For months, we stayed in my mother’s childhood friend’s drawing room in Munirka. My mother and I would distribute blankets and medicines in riot-affected colonies and refugee camps. It was during this time that she wrote Khanabadosh, which won her the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1986. I expressed my own trauma through painting. Though few were interested, I had to depict what I had witnessed. I remember

Mrs (Roshan) Alkazi asking, “Why paint these horrific scenes? You should create happier works.” I replied, “I’ve seen it, and I had to paint it.” Mr (Ebrahim) Alkazi, however, bought some works from the series and

exhibited them.

How central has social commentary been to your artistic practice?

I was raised to believe in equality and the importance of sharing wealth. As an artist, it felt natural to reflect these values in my work. The ‘Maid Servant’ series in the ’70s came from observing the imbalance between mistress and servant — one with everything, the other with nothing. Some works from the series were featured in Lotus, a magazine edited by Faiz Ahmed Faiz. It was a true honour.

A visit to Vrindavan in the late ’80s compelled me to portray the plight of widows in a place so closely tied to Krishna and the gopis. When I heard of Maya Tyagi’s brutal rape by the police, I couldn’t stay silent. I responded with the ‘Rakshak hi Bhakshak’ series. At my first solo show in Mumbai at the Jehangir Art Gallery in 1980, MF Husain bought one of these works. My mother and I had spent the whole night installing all 20 works and, after a brief rest, we returned in the morning to learn that Husain had already made a purchase. He was always generous in encouraging young artists. Much later, I was touched to find that painting in his museum in Bengaluru.

Several of your themes have continued over the years.

Many of them have endured because I feel they are still relevant. For instance, the environment series I began in the early ’80s feels more urgent than ever. During Covid, I reimagined The Last Supper with the world upside down, a reflection on how we have disrupted nature.

Recurring motifs like the charkha, yogi and yogini continue to resurface in my work, each still rich with untapped meaning. Another long-standing concept — the cycle of day and night — has been with me for over 25 years. In this series, a yellow woman holds a thread while a dark woman cuts it — the scissors acting as a metaphor for time. Though galleries and dealers were initially sceptical of this motif, it earned me two affectionate nicknames: Satish Gujral called me Kainchi, and Mallika Sarabhai refers to me as Dhaga.

The Chagos Archipelago sits at the nexus of decolonisation, international law, and global military strategy. Disputed betwMauritius and the United Kingdom, the islands have become a flashpoint for debates on self-determination and post-colonial territorial integrity. While Mauritius argues that the islands are an inalienable part of its territory, the UK maintains its sovereignty, asserting that the islands will eventually be transferred once they are no longer required for military purposes.

The territorial dispute

Sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago remains fiercely contested. Mauritius has repeatedly stated that the archipelago is part of its territory and that the United Kingdom’s claim is a violation of UN resolutions banning the breakup of colonial territories before independence. In contrast, the UK government asserts its uncontested sovereignty over the islands while also promising that they will be handed over to Mauritius when no longer needed for military purposes. With legal and political forums having yielded little progress, Mauritius has persistently pursued its claim on international stages.

In a dramatic twist, just three months into power, the Labour government celebrated what it described as a diplomatic coup. This move effectively ended a long-running dispute over one of Britain’s “last imperial possessions,” while safeguarding a joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia for decades to come. Yet, the decision has not been met with universal acclaim. The transfer of what is often dubbed Britain’s “last African colony” to Mauritius has sparked deep opposition, mistrust, and disappointment from multiple quarters—even drawing criticism from members of the Trump administration in the US.

Mauritius, a history

Story continues below this ad

Mauritius is renowned as one of the world’s most multicultural societies. Its people are largely descendants of Indian labourers, Chinese traders, African slaves, and colonists from the Dutch, French, and British empires. Although Arab and Malay sailors likely visited as early as the 10th century, Mauritius’s recorded history begins in the 16th century. It was a Portuguese sailor, Don Pedro Mascarenhas, who encountered the island in 1512, although he may not have been the first European to set foot there.

In 1598, a Dutch squadron under Admiral Wybrand Van Warwyck landed at Grand Port and named the island after Prince Maurits van Nassau, the stadtholder of Holland. By 1638, the Dutch had established a settlement, using the island as a base for exploring Australia’s western coast. Even after the Dutch left Mauritius in 1710, their influence endured through the introduction of sugarcane, domestic animals, and deer.

Five years later, the French arrived. Landing in 1715, they renamed the island ‘Isle de France’ and established Port Louis as both a naval base and a shipbuilding centre. Under French rule, Mauritius saw an influx of African slaves and the growth of a prosperous sugar industry. The British administration, which began in 1810 with Governor Robert Townsend Farquhar, introduced rapid social and economic reforms, most notably, the abolition of slavery in 1835. Compensation for the loss of slave labour, paid by the Bank of England on behalf of the British government, set in motion what became known as the ‘Great Experiment.’

This experiment highlighted the supposed superiority of free labour over slave labour in plantation colonies, attracting an estimated 462,000 indentured labourers from India, China, Comoros, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Southeast Asia between 1835 and the First World War. Their arrival not only transformed the island’s economy but also its social fabric.

Sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago

Story continues below this ad

In 1965, as Mauritius edged closer to independence, the United Kingdom split the Chagos Archipelago away from Mauritius, with the Mauritian government’s agreement, to form the British Indian Ocean Territory. The new territory also initially included the islands of Aldabra, Farquhar, and Desroches (the latter later returned to the Seychelles upon independence in 1976). Despite these changes, the British retained control of Diego Garcia, an island that now hosts a sprawling US-UK military base and plays a critical role in regional security.

Recent international political pressures pushed the UK to discuss transferring sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. This move is coupled with a 99-year lease for the Diego Garcia base, ensuring its continued strategic utility. On October 3, 2024, the UK announced that it would cede sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius.

On the strategic front, the utility of the joint US-UK military base on Diego Garcia has been legally secured with the lease. As UK negotiator Jonathan Powell explained on X, “This deal was reached in close consultation with US officials and puts the base on legally safe ground for the first time in decades.”

The dual goals of the agreement are clear: to safeguard the security and operational utility of the military base while also aiming to benefit Chagossians—who were displaced in 1965 when the islands were separated from Mauritius to facilitate its independence.

However, the decision has proved deeply controversial within the UK. Critics ranging from former Conservative government ministers to various international commentators have labelled the move “naive” and “dangerous,” arguing that it represents a blow to British prestige.

Although the announcement’s apparent suddenness – coming just three months after the Labour government assumed power – suggests haste, the decision is, in fact, the result of a lengthy, complex negotiation process. It is worth noting that a previous Conservative government had already embarked on negotiations after Mauritius brought the matter before the International Court of Justice, which in 2019 issued a non-binding opinion favouring Mauritius.

US President Donald Trump had back then led a diplomatic offensive at the United Nations to bolster the UK’s claim over the islands. The initiative, however, met with limited success with only three nations, all close political allies of Trump (Israel under Benjamin Netanyahu, Hungary under Viktor Orbán, and Australia under Scott Morrison), supporting the US-UK position. Major international players such as Canada, New Zealand, most members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), Japan, and the Republic of Korea abstained.

Later that year, the UN General Assembly voted 116 in favour to six against—with 56 abstentions—on a resolution welcoming the February 25, 2019, International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the legal consequences of separating the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius. The resolution demanded that the UK unconditionally withdraw its colonial administration from the Chagos Archipelago within six months, allowing Mauritius to complete its decolonisation process.

After a change of government in Mauritius in November 2024, negotiations on the Chagos Islands were reopened in December 2024. Although Mauritius initially sought higher rental fees for the Diego Garcia base, the rental issue appears to have been resolved this month (February 2025), with reports indicating a total payment of around £9 billion over the lease’s 99-year term.

Strategic considerations

The strategic importance of Diego Garcia cannot be overstated. According to an article in Foreign Policy magazine, “Thanks to its vital location, the island houses a military base that served as a critical node for American air operations during the Gulf War and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Post-9/11, it has also been allegedly used as a detention centre by the [US intelligence agency] CIA.” This underscores the long-standing military significance of the island.

Yet, the implications extend far beyond military logistics. Analysts express concerns that the decision to transfer sovereignty may embolden regional competitors. There are fears that China, for example, could develop commercial ports in the region to rival India’s growing economic influence. As Samir Puri of the international think tank Chatham House noted, “This is a long-term matter of concern to monitor, regardless of the UK’s decision on Chagos.”

Adding another layer to the geopolitical calculus, Luke de Pulford, Executive Director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, told the politics and policy news organisation POLITICO, “Recent years have demonstrated beyond doubt China’s willingness to use their leverage to get what they want from strategic partners.” His comments come as evidence of Chinese support for Mauritius becomes increasingly visible.

For instance, a major airport in Mauritius was completed in 2013 with a £197 million loan from Beijing, and reports indicate that China has helped construct key infrastructure projects including the state broadcaster’s headquarters, a dam, and a sports complex. Notably, Mauritius was also the first African nation to sign and activate a free trade agreement with Beijing.

The transfer of sovereignty over the Chagos Islands also invites comparisons with another historic handover – Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997. Under the “one country, two systems” framework, Hong Kong was promised freedoms including freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, and multiple political parties until 2047. However, these assurances were eventually undermined by Beijing’s policies.

Despite these challenges, strategic considerations in the Indian Ocean differ markedly from those in the Pacific. The Chagos Islands lie in close proximity to India, and the country has welcomed the UK’s decision. “In the long run, it is likely that India will play a leading role in Indian Ocean security, and the UK will want to be well-placed to explore how to play a role as an effective partner,” writes Puri.

Meanwhile, the UK has reassured its critics by insisting that the decision regarding the Chagos Islands is a one-off move—distinct from its stance on other overseas territories such as the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar, whose statuses “are not up for negotiation,” according to Foreign Secretary David Lammy.

The saga of the Chagos Islands encapsulates the complexities of decolonisation, international law, and strategic military planning. As Mauritius and the UK navigate their intertwined histories and future aspirations, the dispute over the Chagos Archipelago remains a potent symbol of both the lingering legacies of the empire and the evolving dynamics of global geopolitics.

It really is like magic: one morning there’s nothing on the grass, the next morning, you spot this delicate, silvery grey umbrella-like structure standing on a slim stalk. A look around and you spot a couple more. And the following morning, they vanished! No wonder mushrooms (and toadstools) have all those fairy stories humming around them!

They are of course, a form of fungi that — along with yeast and mold — form an enormous family of micro-organisms that, separated by a billion years from plants and animals, are neither. However, in ways mushrooms resemble both, though they are closer to animals! Like plants, fungi cannot travel and obtain nourishment through an underground network of thread- like roots called hyphae. And like animals, they cannot make their own food via photosynthesis but have to depend on obtaining it second-hand from those that do. Much remains unknown about this vast clan. So far some 1,48,000 species have been identified (out of a possible total of between 2.2-3.8 million), of which 8,000 are known to be harmful to plants and 300 pathogenic to us.

But the good that they do far outweighs the bad. Fungi in various forms (along with bacteria) are principal decomposers of dead organic material, turning them back into nutrients like phosphates and nitrates that are vital for plants. Our planet would be buried under dead, rotting organic material otherwise; a hotbed of disease and infection. Also, fungi recycle carbon and other vital elements into the ecosystem. Along with plants, fungi, in a process called soil carbon sequestration, capture carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the soil for hundreds of years, improving soil fertility and reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.

They can be deadly (the death cap mushroom aka Amanita phalloides), delicious (truffles), nuisances (ringworm) and life savers. Penicillin is a mold, and has saved millions of lives, and yeast has been used for millennia to leaven bread and cakes and in the making of beer, brandy, whisky and rum! We’d have no Camembert or Brie without them. Less toxic mushrooms like the fly agaric — when cooked — have been used for ‘recreational’ purposes, giving people, and especially pop-stars, hallucinogenic highs.

Mushrooms have been used as a food source on a commercial scale and have numerous health benefits, as they are rich in Vitamins B, C, D as well as in phosphorus, potassium, calcium and protein. Six per cent of edible mushrooms have medicinal qualities and can help boost our immune system. Some species are known to be anti-diabetic, inhibit tumour growth and AIDs.

Some fungi can even decompose and degrade pollutants in the atmosphere such as plastics and petroleum-based products as well as personal care products. By enriching the soil and working as bio-pest controllers, they can encourage the growth of forests in degraded areas.

The underground network of hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi deals with plants and trees (as many of 90 per cent of all plants are so involved) to reach beyond the plant’s root network and obtain nourishment for the trees in exchange for carbon. They also enable trees to do deals with each other: those with excess nutrients can supply to those in deficit via the hyphae. But they are a selfish species that takes more than they need and deliberately starve their neighbours. This astonishing underground network has been called the wood wide web. They occur in a bewildering variety, from microscopic molds to varnished shelf-like mushrooms, growing on tree trunks and boughs and quaint toadstool ‘villages’, crouched quietly in the shade.

The visible portions of fungi are their fruiting bodies through which they scatter millions of spores into the breeze via their ‘gills’. Reproduction can be sexual or asexual. The ‘invisible’ food gathering part, called the Mycelium, grows underground. Fungi may grow anywhere – on stale bread, damp leather, dead wood, and as I found, in dewy grass as well.

The spores of one species of fungus – Ophiocordyceps unilateralis aka the zombie ant fungus – can be a complete nightmare for some species of ants like the carpenter ant. The spores fall on the ant, bury themselves inside its body and then, like an evil hacker, take control of the ant’s brain by spreading the hyphae, forcing it to fall out of its nest. They then climb onto a plant of suitable height (around 26 cm) to face the right direction in order to get the right amount of humidity. Now ants are usually hardwired to obey the dictates of the colony and their place in it, so the short-circuiting of this iron-clad system is perhaps something even we should worry about! (Is there a zombie-human fungus out there somewhere biding its time?!) The ant will now clamp onto the stem or leaf with super-bulldog tenacity in a death clasp, while the fungus eats it from the inside. When it is ready to fruit, (and in the final humiliation for the ant), it bursts through the ant’s head spreading spores far and wide, sometimes on to other unfortunate ants in the vicinity.

The study of fungi is called mycology and it is clear that we have to do a lot more of it! We call them puffballs, fairy rings, shiitake, enoki, magic mushrooms, stinkhorns, button mushrooms et al. While it might be romantic to go wandering about in a damp forest collecting mushrooms, it’s better to leave them where they are, and not pan-fry them with a little butter for breakfast. Not even if you are one hundred percent sure they are safe.

Thirty-eight-year-old Tarun Balani has never been to Sindh, his ancestral homeland that was lost to Partition. Named after river Sindhu, meaning Indus, he has never felt the soil of the land between his fingers or visited the revered Jhulelal shrine in Pakistan’s Odero Lal, where Sindhi Hindus and Muslims worship together. But through the stories that the Delhi-based musician heard about his grandfather, who came from Sindh and lived in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar — the refugee colony created post-Partition and where many displaced Sindhis and Multanis were accommodated — Balani would often conjure a place, which was never going to be straightforward to go back to, even sonically. Home was a loss he had inherited. “I feel with Sindhis, the diaspora stories are still missing. It is understandable, probably because Sindh completely went to Pakistan.

But there was, and is, so much palpable grief that no one really speaks about. And that’s also what I wanted to explore,” says Balani, who wanted to portray this feeling through sonic narratives.

Another major reason was that he sorely missed his grandfather, whom he had never met. He only had a bunch of photos and his Yashica 635 since he was very young. “Since my grandfather passed away in a car accident when he was 40, my family didn’t speak much about him,” says Balani, who began poring over whatever was left behind. He found that KS Balani was a postmodern Sindhi writer, photographer and painter in the Delhi of the 1960s. “It is only now that I have discovered his manuscripts, his writing. I started to explore his journey of migration and that is when I wanted to find my Sindhi identity as well,” says Balani.

The longing for his grandfather also turned into a longing for the homeland that his community lost. The result of the emotional turmoil is a seven-track, deeply personal album that is a meditation on memory and loss. “The album is a metaphor for my grandfather as much as it is for the lost homeland,” says Balani, who was inspired by famed Sindhi poet Sheikh Ayaz’s poem Tiri Pawanda about the pain of separation and reuniting someday. Balani flipped one of the lines — Tadahen milandaaseen (We will meet then) to Kadahin Milandaasin (When will we meet again?), which is the title of the album. He adds that as people, we don’t talk about grief enough and he wanted to honour the feeling he felt for his grandfather. His father’s death last year in November amplified the pain. He wondered about two photographs his father gave him last February. One is a black-and-white shot of his grandparents and other a self-portrait of his grandfather — both are now part of the album cover.

With Adam O’Farrill on trumpet, Sharik Hasan on piano, Olli Hirvonen on guitar and electronics and Balani on drums and vocals, the album was recorded by Grammy-winning sound engineer and producer John Davis. There are no Sindhi stringed instruments or field recordings from Pakistan that have been layered with jazz sounds. Instead, Balani has stayed true to his sound and that of his band and delineated loss as a feeling. He has represented his heritage through what he identifies with most and not reproduced what he’s heard and even loved from his culture.

While the elegant Lajpat Nagar Sometimes comes from Balani’s fascination with the idea that his studio space is also the one where his grandfather wrote and painted, the title track is where he’s sung for the first time, an ode to his father, who sang Hindustani classical, and always wanted his son to sing. The haunting Sailaab plays out the 2020 floods in Sindh while Every Man Saved A Victim Will Be Found is an interpretation of Balani’s most-streamed track from his EP In Song (2021), inspired by a line in Viktor Frankl’s 1946 book Man’s Search for Meaning based on his time living in concentration camps. In the music video of the title track, Balani has attempted to recreate the parties from his childhood; with typical Sindhi motifs — the Ajrakh shawl, Sindhi topi and Sindhi roti make an appearance.

But such an album was likely to come at an emotional cost, and if he was lucky, with an emotional reward as well. Does Balani understand his place better? “Absolutely. I went in with a simple quest to understand my roots and legacy, but it was still a borrowed experience; the grief was through the lens of other people, but after losing my dad, I understood it more deeply. In the end, I was tracing my granddad and his lineage but I found a version of myself that I didn’t know existed,” says Balani. Recently, some Sindhi literature teachers have written to Balani telling him that they teach his grandfather’s stories to their students. “Life has come full circle,” he says.

Rajya Sabha MP Ram Chander Jangra Saturday courted controversy with his remarks that the tourists, who lost their lives in Pahalgam should have put up a fight against the terrorists and the women, who lost their husbands in the terror attack, “lacked” the spirit of the warrior women.

“Wahan par jo hamari veerangnayein behane thee, jinki maang ka sindoor chheen liya gaya, Veerangna ka bhaav nahin tha, josh nahin tha, jazba nahin tha, dil nahin tha, isliye haath jod ke goli ka shikaar ho gaye (Women, who lost their husbands, did not have the spirit and vigour. Therefore, they became victims of the attack),” Jangra said.

The occupants of an SUV that crashed into a car on Patna’s Boring Canal Road returned an hour later and opened fire Saturday evening, police said. The SUV was then chased by a police vehicle, but managed to evade capture.

“No injury has been reported so far,” Patna Senior Superintendent of Police Awakash Kumar said. Citywide alerts have been issued and multiple teams have been deployed to trace the vehicle and identify those involved, he said.

Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Saket Kumar said that as per the preliminary investigation, the incident began when a black SUV, reportedly without a number plate, crashed into a hatchback car from behind on Boring Canal Road, under the S K Puri police station limits. “Following the collision, an altercation took place between the occupants of the two vehicles. But bystanders intervened, and the SUV occupants left the scene with the vehicle,” the SDPO said, adding that the investigation suggests the “same vehicle returned approximately an hour later”.

“The suspects in the SUV approached from the side of Pant Bhavan and fired two rounds near Hartali Chowk. A short distance away, two more rounds were fired, and then, after taking a U-turn towards R-Block, two additional rounds were fired on the flyover,” Kumar said. Police recovered a live cartridge and an empty shell from the scene.

Police said Additional Director General (Law & Order) Pankaj Darad was returning from a meeting at the time of the incident, trailing two-three cars behind the suspects.

“He instructed his driver to pursue the suspects. His bodyguard also fired in retaliation. The black SUV was pursued up to the GPO area,” the SDPO said. However, he said, the suspects managed to evade capture.

“CCTV footage from the area and the route are being analysed. Teams have been formed and continuous efforts are being made to identify, locate and arrest the suspects at the earliest,” SSP Awakash said.

Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, who has raised Rs 50 crore from a few big industrialists to fund a group medical insurance policy for the Bar’s members, has met with opposition from a section within the association.

“As the new SCBA president, my first endeavour will be to discuss this policy in the Executive Committee meeting… My personal view is that this policy definitely needs to be renegotiated or scrapped, because the premium that we are paying for a Rs 2 lakh cover is highly disproportionate to the premium that we pay for a Rs 5 lakh cover,” Senior Advocate Vikas Singh, who was elected the new president of the Bar body last week, told The Indian Express.

At a General Body Meeting of the SCBA on May 5, Singh had expressed his opposition. To a question on whether Sibal’s endeavour raised issues of conflict of interest, Singh said it depends on whether these are CSR funds.

“There is no conflict if its not CSR funds as the money is given to the association and not to any individual,” he said.

When contacted, Sibal said, “There is no conflict of interest here. Where is the question? The donation is to the association and not to any member. Moreover, personally, I have and may appear again against or in favour of many of these companies. And I charge them. Our professional career is not based on our friendships.”

Sibal said Mukesh Ambani (Reliance Industries) contributed Rs 10 crore, while Anil Ambani (Reliance Group), Gautam Adani (Adani Group), N Chandrasekharan (Tata Sons), Samir Mehta (Torrent Group), G M Rao (GMR Group), Kumar Mangalam Birla (Aditya Birla Group), Anil Aggarwal (Vedanta) and Lakshmi Mittal (ArcelorMittal) gave Rs 5 crore each.

He said corporates would get tax exemption under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. Donations made to specified institutions are allowed to be deducted from the taxable income under Section 80G.

SCBA’s new President Singh said his attempt would be (to ensure) that this policy was made available only to needy members of the Bar or members who support elderly parents. “It should not be made available for people like us. The policy, as announced by the earlier Executive Committee, is meant for everybody, including me, Mr Sibal etc. This kind of money can never be utilised for that…All this will be done only after discussing with my Executive Committee.”

According to Sibal, 95 per cent of lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court do not earn well. “They come from all over the country to Delhi…to practise…most of them are not earning well… they have to spend money on rent, their families… and if they fall ill, have to foot medical bills.” He said there are about 2,700-2,800 members of the SCBA who have voting rights, and will be eligible for the health cover.

Addressing an event organised by the SCBA on May 21, Sibal explained how he went about raising the money. “I started sort of collecting from those who I have served for the last 52 years… I rang up Anil Aggarwal of Vedanta. He readily agreed and gave us a contribution of Rs 5 crore. I rang up Anil Ambani, a dear friend of mine, and he had no choice but to say yes. So he gave Rs 5 crore. I rang up the GMR Group, both Mr Rao as well as Mr Bhaskar Chandran… and they said, ‘Sir, now that you have asked, we will make sure that it happens’, and it happened, Rs 5 crore,” said Sibal.

“I rang up Gautam Adani, and I said it’s time for you to contribute because you are more or less the emperor of India now and Rs 5 crore is too little for you. He said if you want more, I will give more, but here is Rs 5 crore. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” Sibal said. “Mr Kumar Mangalam Birla, again an old friend of mine… served the Birla empire for many years…never asked them for anything. So I said, another Rs 5 crore from you, and he said yes,” he said.

“Then I rang up another friend of mine, Lakshmi Mittal from London. He picked up the phone and I made that request. He said somebody will get in touch with you soon. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” he said. “Then again, Mukesh Ambani. I knew Dhirubhai Ambani when I was a young lawyer and we had a very warm relationship…These boys were kids and they used to come to me and I used to do most of their matters in Bombay. So I asked him and he said how much do you want. I said Rs 10 crore. He said you will have the cheque soon. So he gave Rs 10 crore,” Sibal said.

“Then I rang up Natarajan Chandrasekaran of Tata, whom I also know very well…and he also did not hesitate. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” the senior counsel said. “And from the Torrent Group, Mr Samir Mehta, again a good friend of mine, and, in fact, Dushyant Dave told me, if he doesn’t give it, let me know, I will make a call to him. But it didn’t really happen. I asked him, he gave Rs 5 crore… In this process, we have Rs 50 crore with us,” Sibal said.

He also outlined what was done after raising the amount. “I contacted Apollo group, who are also my clients. I know the head of the family, head of the Apollo group is an old friend of mine. So I said look, we want you to handle this. He sort of looked at the market and got hold of a company called the National Insurance Company. And we started talking to the National Insurance Company as to what kind of benefits our young lawyers can get. I want to tell you… there is no insurance policy in this country that gives so many benefits as this one does,” he said.

Chief Justice of India B R Gavai, who also addressed the event, congratulated the SCBA for raising Rs 50 crore. “Undoubtedly, this is a remarkable achievement that reflects deep concern for the welfare of the legal community,” he said.

Pointing to the difficulties that young lawyers face with no regular income to meet their needs, the CJI said: “Providing good health insurance, therefore, is not just a welfare measure, it is a vital support system. It offers the lawyers a degree of financial security and peace of mind in times of medical need.”

The Madhya Pradesh government has launched an investigation into the mysterious deaths of eight high-value racehorses — belonging to heritage breeds — that were recently transported from Hyderabad to Raipura village in Jabalpur district.

Jabalpur Collector Deepak Saxena ordered the probe after the local veterinary department responded to reports of multiple horse deaths at a private farm in Raipura. Officials are now examining allegations that a total of 57 horses were transferred from Hyderabad to Madhya Pradesh without the required veterinary documentation.

Authorities are investigating claims that “around 57 horses were covertly moved between 29 April and 3 May” by a local resident, Sachin Tiwari, in collaboration with a businessman based in Hyderabad. Among the breeds transported were Marwari and Thoroughbred horses.

The Marwari, native to Rajasthan, is distinguished by its inward-curving ears and known for being a hardy riding horse with a natural ambling gait. Thoroughbreds, originally bred in England, are globally renowned for their speed, agility and racing prowess. Marwari horses are often crossed with Thoroughbreds to produce a larger horse with more versatility.

According to Prafulla Moon, deputy director of the state veterinary department, four teams were deployed after officials located the horses.

“The horses were transported in a hot atmosphere from Hyderabad. The horses began falling sick due to stress. In total, eight horses have died. We have sent blood samples of 57 horses to a lab in Haryana. The reports of 44 horses have come negative for any infectious disease,” Moon said.

Preliminary findings suggest that the animals were housed in inadequate conditions — a cramped cattle shed with insufficient shade and limited space to move.

Following public outcry, the National Horse Breeding Society of India dispatched a truck carrying medical supplies to the farm. However, farm owner Sachin Tiwari allegedly barred the vehicle from entering the premises. In response, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Madhya Pradesh High Court, which is expected to hear the matter in the coming days.

The PIL, filed by Jabalpur-based animal rights activist Simran Issar through her advocate Umesh Tripathi, seeks urgent court intervention to “protect the life of 49 horses” still held at the facility. The petition describes the animals being kept in open fields during a heatwave without adequate access to water, sanitation, or shelter.

The petition further claims that one of the respondents—a Hyderabad-based businessman—is the “kingpin behind sponsoring all big horsing races in the country, with online betting ventures exclusively for the Philippines”. According to the PIL: “At the peak of this horse racing venture, they have 154 horses for racing. They had 24 horse races everyday according to Manager for these horse races… This horse racing, which is illegal in India, was streamed on an app in the Philippines.”

The petition also asserts that the operation fell into neglect after staff salaries were allegedly not paid, leaving “154 horses without food and water”.

“That, in the first week of February, 2025, out of 154 horses only 64 horses were left…That, these remaining horses were loaded on truck and were sent to Jabalpur from Hyderabad in the command and control of Sachin Tiwari,” the PIL stated.

In 1815, the Chatterjee family in Calcutta’s Shibpur celebrated the birth of a male heir and marked the moment by donating 100 cows. They also named the boy Golaknath, meaning “the owner of millions of cows”. Educated in a missionary school, Golaknath converted to Christianity at age 14. Shunned by his family, he is said to have walked thousands of kilometres, first to Benaras, then Allahabad and finally to Punjab.

In Jalandhar, the aristocratic Brahmin joined the Scottish American Presbyterian Mission, becoming the first Indian to be ordained a minister. Over a century later, Golaknath Chatterjee’s descendants would lend their name to what’s perhaps one of the most consequential constitutional cases — IC Golaknath v State of Punjab.

In 1962, land owned by the evangelical family ran into trouble with the Punjab government, which ordered that the family’s land was “surplus” under its land ceiling laws. While the right to property was then a fundamental right — it stayed that way until the 44th constitutional Amendment in 1978 — the government had through a series of reforms and Amendments diluted the right over the years.

In 1964, through the 17th Amendment, the Parliament had added the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953, to the Ninth Schedule, putting it beyond judicial purview. In 1967, the Supreme Court, while deciding on the family’s petition challenging the Punjab land ceiling law and the 17th Amendment reopened the question on whether the Parliament could amend fundamental rights.

The ruling, for the first time limited Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution. While doing so, the court would reverse a view it had consistently held for 17 years until then — that Parliament had the power to tinker with fundamental rights.

“Golaknath was a moment where the judiciary asserted itself against a government that amassed more and more power to change the Constitution. The SC’s responsibility to ensure that Parliament’s majority does not become majoritarian is as relevant today as it was in 1967,” Dr Faizan Mustafa, Vice-Chancellor of Chanakya National Law University, Patna, says.

The petitioner, the case

In 1891, when Golaknath Chatterjee died, his son Henry Golaknath took over as Reverend of the church his father had founded in Jalandhar.

Henry, one of Golaknath’s 14 children, had in 1882 graduated from the Princeton Theological Seminary. Along with his brother William Golaknath, he bought and developed nearly 500 acres around the mission in Bhogpur, approximately 25 km from Jalandhar. While 101-year-old Henry died in 1962, his son Inder and daughter Indira were to inherit the land. However, the District Collector, under the land ceiling law, allowed Inder, Indira and Inder’s four daughters a few acres each, declaring around 418 acres as “surplus” that would vest with the state or the tenants.

As the case landed in the Supreme Court, a host of leading lawyers — Nani Palkhivala, M K Nambyar, Ashoke Kumar Sen and Fali Nariman — made the case for Inder C Golaknath, the petitioner. In their arguments, they highlighted the perils of having no restrictions on the Parliament’s powers to amend the Constitution.

On February 27, 1967, an 11-judge Bench of the SC, headed by then Chief Justice of India Koka Subba Rao, reopened the issue of constitutional amendments diluting the right to property. The Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, had, among other aspects, added the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953, to the Ninth Schedule, putting it beyond judicial purview. The amendment again raised the same larger question, which was discussed in earlier parts of The Indian Express’s series — whether a constitutional amendment can truncate fundamental rights.

In Sankari Prasad v State of Bihar (1951) and Sajjan Singh v State of Rajasthan (1964), the Court had ruled that Parliament had no fetters on its power to amend the Constitution. While it was the right to property that Parliament consistently tinkered with, as the ruling termed it, an “argument of fear” had begun to take shape — that if Parliament can take away one right, it could take away any right.

“It is said that if Article 368 (dealing with amendment process) is held to confer full (power) to amend each and every part of the Constitution as has been held in Sankari Prasad’s case, Parliament may do all kinds of things, which were never intended, under this unfettered power and may, for example, abolish elected legislatures, abolish the President or change the present form of Government into a Presidential type like the United States Constitution or do away with the federal structure altogether,” then CJI Rao articulated.

In a 6:5 verdict, the SC, in one stroke, overruled its two earlier rulings and held that Parliament did not have the power to abridge or take away fundamental rights. While CJI Rao and five others formed the majority, Justice K N Wanchoo wrote a minority opinion.

“The power of amendment contained in a written federal constitution is a safety valve which, to a large extent provides for stable growth and makes violent revolution more or less unnecessary,” Justice Wanchoo wrote.

It was in the Golaknath case that the “basic structure” argument was first made by veteran lawyer M K Nambyar, who was inspired by German Professor Dietrich Conrad. Court records show that during the arguments in court, the lawyers referred to how the government was using the legislature as a means of securing changes in the laws which it desires. There were also references to Hitler’s Germany.

The ruling was perhaps also a reflection of its times. The Republic had moved from a new nation that had emerged from the shadow of colonialism to one that was beginning to confront its internal issues. For the first 17 years, the SC had allowed the Parliament to change the Constitution, but many of those parliamentarians were part of the independence movement. In fact, the first constitutional Amendment was made by the provisional Parliament, which was essentially the Constituent Assembly. As the generation changed, the relationship between the executive and the judiciary too began to change.

The Golaknath ruling came around the same time when the Indira Gandhi-led Congress government had come back to power at the Centre, but lost power in several states. The political implications of the ruling had far-reaching consequences for the judiciary. It did not help that Justice Rao resigned as CJI, three months before his term ended and contested for the Presidential elections as the Opposition’s candidate. He, however, lost the election to former President Zakir Hussain.

The government, however, saw the court’s Golaknath ruling — and subsequent adverse rulings, including the bank nationalisation case (1970) — as open confrontation. The government hit back by superseding judges seen as inimical to its socialist policies.

After the verdict

Despite the win, the Golaknaths did not get back their land. “We didn’t even get what was permissible under the law, where each family member could have a standard 30 acres. We received less than one-third of it. Whatever land we did get, we were pressured by villagers to sell it at a ridiculously low price,” Vimal, one of Inder Golaknath’s four daughters, tells The Indian Express.

The family still retains the 150-year-old ‘The Retreat Golaknath House’ spanning three acres in the corner of Football Chowk, located in the heart of Jalandhar city. The Golaknath Church, located on the mission compound, is run by Golaknath’s sixth-generation descendants.

Among Golaknath’s many descendants are several illustrious personalities. Dora Chatterjee, the daughter of Golaknath’s third child Mary, and Kali Charan Chatterjee, a leading Bengali Christian missionary who was one of India’s first woman doctors. Then there was Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, daughter of Priscilla, Golaknath’s fourth child, who became a minister in the first Cabinet.

Six years after the Golaknath verdict, the Supreme Court would revisit it. This time, in the landmark Kesavananda Bharati ruling (1973), a 13-judge Bench, in a narrow 6:7 ruling, came up with the magic formula — the basic structure test. The SC would say that the Golaknath ruling was valid to the extent that Parliament cannot tinker with fundamental rights, which form part of the basic structure of the Constitution, but the right to property itself, which was essential to Golaknath’s descendants, did not form part of that basic structure.

In the Subcontinent, Pakistani poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s uncompromising 1979 poem Hum dekhenge (“We shall see”) has mostly travelled with ease. This famed protest song, written against General Ziaul Haq’s conservative rule, has outlived regimes, resurfacing in moments of protest across both sides of the border. But in recent years, it seems to be increasingly caught in the crosshairs of cross-border hostilities. Last week, Pushpa Sathidar, wife of actor and Dalit rights activist Vira Sathidar (who was seen as Narayan Kamble in Chaitanya Tamhane’s National Award-winning film, Court) and two others, were booked under Section 152 of the BNS, for “endangering the sovereignty and integrity of the nation”, Section 196 for promoting enmity between groups and Section 353 for statements conducing to public mischief, after she organised a memorial for her husband in Nagpur. It is at this memorial that the members of Samata Kala Manch — an Ambedkarite cultural outfit that often speaks of class, caste and Brahminical hegemony — sang the Faiz poem.

In the FIR, right-wing activist Dattatraya Shirke alleged that the poem by a Pakistani poet was sung at a time when the country valiantly fought Pakistani forces in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack. He accused the organisers of using provocative language that could incite unrest.

In this moment, I wonder about Faiz, the humanist, the star of Progressive Writers’ Movement in undivided India, who opposed communalism, who condemned terrorism, whose writing grieved the scars of violence and lauded the resilience of the downtrodden, who wrote Hum dekhenge against the atrocities of his own government. In 2020, IIT Kanpur formed a panel to look into the recitation of the poem on their campus by some students. The committee had concluded that the poem was “unsuitable to the time and place” and recommended “counselling” for those involved. Faiz’s work was also removed from school textbooks in 2022.

One is left wondering whether all of this stems from a lack of understanding or simply an unwillingness to engage with a poet whose work is accessible, deeply documented and who spoke not for Pakistan or India but for a better, more inclusive world. Days after Partition was announced, when the streets on both sides of the border were rife with violence, a deeply anguished Faiz wrote, “Yeh daagh daagh ujala, yeh shab gazidaa seher/ Woh intezaar tha jiska, yeh woh seher toh nahin” (This smudged first light, this daybreak battered by night/ This dawn that we all ached for, this is not the one) [Subh-e-Azadi (Dawn of Freedom)].

Faiz’s poetry, its universality and its constant endeavour to uphold human dignity are what make it significant. Written in Beirut, where Faiz was living in a self-imposed exile, after his blunt political views were condemned for being “anti-Pakistan”, Hum dekhenge quickly became a symbol of dissent, first in Pakistan and then in the Subcontinent. It also found significance in ghazal singer Iqbal Bano’s oeuvre, when she sang it in 1986 at Lahore Arts Council’s Alhamra auditorium, a year after Faiz’s death, clad in a black sari — an act of rebellion at a time when saris were banned at public venues and on television. She sang it with vigour, pausing often as the exhilarated thousands who’d gathered in and outside the hall chanted Inquilab zindabad. This rendition, in one of the darkest periods of Pakistan’s history, took the song to the common man. It was surreptitiously recorded by a technician. The recording was banned; so was Bano from singing in public. They thought the poem was “anti-Muslim”. In India, the poem has often been called “anti-Hindu”. Which is it really? If one really pays attention, it’s not hard to see that it is anti-oppression.

The lines that bothered Pakistan then and bother India now, including in the current FIR are as follows: “Jab arz-e-Khuda ke kaabe se, sab butt uthwaye jaayenge/ Hum ahl-e-safa mardood-e-haram, masnad pe bithaaye jaayenge / Sab taaj uchhale jaayenge, sab takht giraaye jaayenge (From the abode of God, when the icons of falsehood will be removed/ When we, the faithful, who have been barred from sacred places, will be seated on high pedestal/ When crowns will be tossed, when thrones will be brought down)”. Shirke has claimed that the thrones being brought down constitute a direct threat to the government. And yet, songs can’t overturn governments; they can only gnaw at the illusion that power lasts forever.

In 1989, almost a year after Ziaul Haq’s death in an aircrash and the return of democracy to Pakistan, Bano performed at Delhi’s Siri Fort, with the hall brimming with ghazal enthusiasts who had one demand from her — Hum dekhenge.

If convicted, the punishment for Pushpa and the others can be imprisonment and a fine. That is for the courts to decide. But Hum dekhenge has and should endure — as a reminder of the courage art is capable of. To quote Faiz, “Bol ke lab azaad hain tere/ Bol ki zubaan ab tak teri hai… Bol ki sach zinda hai ab tak/ Bol jo kuch kehna hai keh le” (Speak, for your lips are yet free/ Speak, for your tongue is still your own/ Speak, the truth is still alive/ Speak: say what you have to say).

“’I don’t know what to do, sir. Let’s please discuss and do something…’”

Coach Vijayakumar Madyalkar vividly remembers the sombre evening when his former Karnataka U-25 ward had checked into his academy with a desperate plea to revive his career. India’s second Test triple-centurion, Karun Nair, suddenly had nowhere to go after Karnataka – his domestic abode throughout his formative years – had landed a stunning snub after the 2022 season in June.

An emotional tweet in the winter of 2022 wouldn’t have been enough to tether the widening gulf between him and ‘Dear Cricket.’ Picking himself up, one watchful step at a time, Nair plotted his deeply personal attempt to fight back from the wilderness with Madyalkar and a WhatsApp group.

Story continues below this ad

On Saturday, the purpose of Nair’s ‘Comeback Season’ group with his trainer, Sai Prasanna and his assistant was fulfilled after two whole years of sweat, tears and a grind in silence. An improbable Test return, a first in seven years, was made possible over the course of an epochal domestic season across formats. A transitioning Team India is now bidding to lean in on Nair’s wiser profile for a new era under Shubman Gill in another World Test Championship cycle.

Finding feet

Not too long ago, everything had come to a standstill for Nair as he rummaged for answers between the painful Karnataka rejection in July ‘22 and a First-Class comeback 14 months later in Northamptonshire.

Turning to his former Karnataka U-19 and U-25 coach, Madyalkar at the Just Cricket Academy on the outskirts of Bengaluru, Nair journeyed nearly three hours every second day for a gruelling semester of reset.

“He was internally broken. I didn’t want to discuss why he couldn’t make the Karnataka team. I just told him not to worry, and we will only look at the batsman in him and refine the skills as much as possible,” Madyalkar says.

‘600 a day’

“Six months. Every alternate day, he used to come to bat 600 balls precisely, facing the side-arm throwers and other bowlers in our academy.”

Having seen the likes of KL Rahul and Nair since their age-group days, Madyalkar insists the duo stressed intensity and shot refinement above overt technical adjustments.

The lack of matches at home during a full-fledged domestic season set in panic. “He wanted to test his game but we just could not get him any game time here. There were no opportunities in India when the season was on, and so he had latched onto the County stint that came after a year.”

Arriving at the Oval, the venue of his 2018 heartbreak and exit from the Indian side, Nair struck a career-reviving 150 in only his second county division 1 game for Northamptonshire.

The stint would pave the way for a pivotal ‘guest’ player union with Vidarbha for 2023-24, thrusting his red-ball credentials back into the national picture. 1553 runs in 33 innings, including his career-best Ranji Trophy season with 883 runs culminating in a title win for Vidarbha this season, meant Nair’s middle-order stoicism had its worth for the national side in the wake of a red-ball crisis.

Story continues below this ad

“He has compelled the national selectors here with his performances for a recall,” Vidarbha coach Usman Ghani tells The Indian Express, recalling Nair’s seamless transition into the side within his first year.

In hindsight, Ghani says the decision to elevate Nair to 50-over captaincy for the Vijay Hazare Trophy tournament earlier this year proved to be a pathbreaking move.

Nair had a stupendous Ranji Trophy knockouts – 423 runs including a century in the final against Kerala in March this year. (PTI) Nair had a stupendous Ranji Trophy knockouts – 423 runs including a century in the final against Kerala in March this year. (PTI)

“When a player like Karun came, he was tasked with the middle order. He had blossomed in his first season itself, so we decided to make him the captain for the Vijay Hazare this time. The added responsibility just got the best out of him. That momentum, that confidence, he brought them into the knockouts of the Ranji Trophy,” Ghani says.

Despite ending up short in the final to Karnataka in the VHT, Nair’s eye-popping 779 runs at 389.50 and five centuries (four in succession) would gather steam and chatter for an India recall. The stupendous Ranji Trophy knockouts – 423 runs including a century in the final against Kerala in March – eventually sealed the deal.

“Karun is a supreme athlete in the mental aspects. He had this honest feeling and work ethic to regain his place in the Test squad. That’s something all youngsters can learn from. He looked after his fitness too. So, that’s how the selectors rewarded him today,” Ghani remarks.

“He lost 10 kilos and gained about 5 kilos back in muscles. After the first couple of games when he started scoring this season, we introduced him to a lot of power training and heavy lifts. He just wanted to transform completely,” says Prasanna.

Yet, the Nair of ‘18 and ‘25 aren’t contrasting in many ways to his coach. Having retained the core of his technique and temperament, Madyalkar is “praying” that Karun smashes India’s first century on the tour.

When the Oval reunion beckons in a series-ending fifth match in August, Nair will hope he has better answers written this time, for himself and India’s reimagined Test middle-order.

Adani to Ambani: Sibal gets India Inc to pay Rs 50 crore for lawyers’ health cover

2 hr ago

Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, who has raised Rs 50 crore from a few big industrialists to fund a group medical insurance policy for the Bar’s members, has met with opposition from a section within the association. “As the new SCBA president, my first endeavour will be to discuss this policy in the Executive Committee meeting... My personal view is that this policy definitely needs to be renegotiated or scrapped, because the premium that we are paying for a Rs 2 lakh cover is highly disproportionate to the premium that we pay for a Rs 5 lakh cover,” Senior Advocate Vikas Singh, who was elected the new president of the Bar body last week, told The Indian Express. At a General Body Meeting of the SCBA on May 5, Singh had expressed his opposition. To a question on whether Sibal’s endeavour raised issues of conflict of interest, Singh said it depends on whether these are CSR funds. “There is no conflict if its not CSR funds as the money is given to the association and not to any individual,” he said. When contacted, Sibal said, “There is no conflict of interest here. Where is the question? The donation is to the association and not to any member. Moreover, personally, I have and may appear again against or in favour of many of these companies. And I charge them. Our professional career is not based on our friendships.” Sibal said Mukesh Ambani (Reliance Industries) contributed Rs 10 crore, while Anil Ambani (Reliance Group), Gautam Adani (Adani Group), N Chandrasekharan (Tata Sons), Samir Mehta (Torrent Group), G M Rao (GMR Group), Kumar Mangalam Birla (Aditya Birla Group), Anil Aggarwal (Vedanta) and Lakshmi Mittal (ArcelorMittal) gave Rs 5 crore each. He said corporates would get tax exemption under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. Donations made to specified institutions are allowed to be deducted from the taxable income under Section 80G. SCBA’s new President Singh said his attempt would be (to ensure) that this policy was made available only to needy members of the Bar or members who support elderly parents. “It should not be made available for people like us. The policy, as announced by the earlier Executive Committee, is meant for everybody, including me, Mr Sibal etc. This kind of money can never be utilised for that…All this will be done only after discussing with my Executive Committee.” According to Sibal, 95 per cent of lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court do not earn well. “They come from all over the country to Delhi…to practise…most of them are not earning well… they have to spend money on rent, their families… and if they fall ill, have to foot medical bills.” He said there are about 2,700-2,800 members of the SCBA who have voting rights, and will be eligible for the health cover. Addressing an event organised by the SCBA on May 21, Sibal explained how he went about raising the money. “I started sort of collecting from those who I have served for the last 52 years... I rang up Anil Aggarwal of Vedanta. He readily agreed and gave us a contribution of Rs 5 crore. I rang up Anil Ambani, a dear friend of mine, and he had no choice but to say yes. So he gave Rs 5 crore. I rang up the GMR Group, both Mr Rao as well as Mr Bhaskar Chandran... and they said, ‘Sir, now that you have asked, we will make sure that it happens’, and it happened, Rs 5 crore,” said Sibal. “I rang up Gautam Adani, and I said it’s time for you to contribute because you are more or less the emperor of India now and Rs 5 crore is too little for you. He said if you want more, I will give more, but here is Rs 5 crore. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” Sibal said. “Mr Kumar Mangalam Birla, again an old friend of mine... served the Birla empire for many years…never asked them for anything. So I said, another Rs 5 crore from you, and he said yes,” he said. “Then I rang up another friend of mine, Lakshmi Mittal from London. He picked up the phone and I made that request. He said somebody will get in touch with you soon. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” he said. “Then again, Mukesh Ambani. I knew Dhirubhai Ambani when I was a young lawyer and we had a very warm relationship…These boys were kids and they used to come to me and I used to do most of their matters in Bombay. So I asked him and he said how much do you want. I said Rs 10 crore. He said you will have the cheque soon. So he gave Rs 10 crore,” Sibal said. “Then I rang up Natarajan Chandrasekaran of Tata, whom I also know very well…and he also did not hesitate. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” the senior counsel said. “And from the Torrent Group, Mr Samir Mehta, again a good friend of mine, and, in fact, Dushyant Dave told me, if he doesn’t give it, let me know, I will make a call to him. But it didn’t really happen. I asked him, he gave Rs 5 crore... In this process, we have Rs 50 crore with us,” Sibal said. He also outlined what was done after raising the amount. “I contacted Apollo group, who are also my clients. I know the head of the family, head of the Apollo group is an old friend of mine. So I said look, we want you to handle this. He sort of looked at the market and got hold of a company called the National Insurance Company. And we started talking to the National Insurance Company as to what kind of benefits our young lawyers can get. I want to tell you… there is no insurance policy in this country that gives so many benefits as this one does,” he said. Chief Justice of India B R Gavai, who also addressed the event, congratulated the SCBA for raising Rs 50 crore. “Undoubtedly, this is a remarkable achievement that reflects deep concern for the welfare of the legal community,” he said. Pointing to the difficulties that young lawyers face with no regular income to meet their needs, the CJI said: “Providing good health insurance, therefore, is not just a welfare measure, it is a vital support system. It offers the lawyers a degree of financial security and peace of mind in times of medical need.”

It’s a no-brainer that Indian students are embracing global education like never before – Indian students are embracing international education with unprecedented enthusiasm, from the Ivy leagues of the U.S. to the innovation hubs of Germany, the cultural melting pots of Australia to the research-rich campuses of Ireland.

And 2025? It’s shaping up to be a breakout year for outbound Indian learners.

But we would also have to acknowledge the external ongoings that we see around – geopolitical instability is redrawing immigration policies overnight, AI is moving faster than most universities (and employers) can adapt, and Gen Z learning preferences are evolving toward modular, skill-first education. Micro-credentials, stackable degrees, and hybrid learning pathways are becoming the new normal.

Story continues below this ad

What’s more interesting – the demand isn’t just coming from India’s top metros anymore. Students from Tier 2 and 3 cities, backed by rising disposable incomes and access to information, are now eyeing global education as a viable and sometimes essential – step to secure their future. Those belonging to this demography are usually ‘price-conscious’ and ‘value-conscious’ at the same time and therefore prefer affordable degrees that do not compromise on the quality of education.

And this ambition isn’t just anecdotal – it’s backed by data.

Beyond Migration: Why Indian Students are Opting to Study Abroad

According to upGrad’s Study Abroad Report from last year, which draws insights from over 25,000 respondents across India, the motivation to study overseas is shifting. Today’s students aren’t chasing passports, they’re chasing possibilities. The top driver? Access to better job opportunities and future-forward careers, not just migration.

Story continues below this ad

This flips the traditional narrative. Far from being driven solely by wanderlust or cultural curiosity, Indian aspirants are prioritising global academic exposure, practical learning, and long-term career readiness. It’s a pragmatic, ROI-focused mindset; where international education is seen less as a leap of faith, and more as a calculated investment.

Interestingly, the data reveals that students from ISC and CBSE boards form the largest cohort of study abroad hopefuls, indicating strong academic intent and a high degree of readiness to take on global education ecosystems.

A Smarter Way to the U.S. Without the Usual Barriers

While destinations like Germany and France are steadily climbing the preference charts, the United States continues to hold its ground as the gold standard for global education – thanks to its world-class universities, unmatched research infrastructure, and deep integration with global employers across sectors.

As electric mobility gains ground in India, the narrative around electric two-wheelers is evolving. While the early focus revolved around battery range, today’s urban commuter is seeking more – durability, reliability, low maintenance, and long-term value. The industry is gradually shifting from chasing range headlines to building vehicles that offer peace of mind and consistent performance over time.

Leading this thoughtful transition is Suzuki Motorcycle India (SMIPL), with its first electric offering, the Suzuki e-ACCESS. The company is tapping into this evolving consumer mindset with its carefully engineered Suzuki e-ACCESS electric scooter. Rather than following the herd, Suzuki Motorcycle India is focusing on real-world performance and durable battery choices.

Battery Chemistry That Defines Long-Term Value: Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP)

Story continues below this ad

The battery remains the most critical component in an electric two-wheeler, not just for power delivery but also for its impact on ownership experience. While The Indian market has predominantly seen the use of Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) batteries, valued for their high energy density and lighter weight characteristics, Suzuki Motorcycle India has chosen to equip the Suzuki e-ACCESS with Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery technology, a move grounded in longevity and real-world performance.

LFP batteries are known for their longer cycle life, often lasting two to three times longer than their NMC counterparts. They also offer better thermal stability, minimizing the risks of overheating and battery-related incidents, especially crucial in India’s varied climatic conditions. While LFP batteries may be marginally heavier and offer slightly lower energy density, their long-term benefits far outweigh these trade-offs for everyday riders providing them a greater peace of mind.

Why Long-Lasting Battery Really Counts

Battery replacement is one of the most significant expenses in the total cost of EV ownership. A battery that begins with a 100 km range might deteriorate to 60–70 km within a few years if it isn’t built for long-term endurance. This decline not only impacts usability but also leads to inconveniences of frequent recharges or premature costly replacements for the everyday rider.

The Suzuki e-ACCESS delivers a range of 95 km with a 3.1 kWh LFP battery, a figure aligned with internal studies indicating that the average Indian two-wheeler user travels about 30 km daily*. This range supports three days of typical urban commuting on a single charge, reducing charging frequency while maintaining optimal ride quality.

By prioritizing balance over bulk, Suzuki Motorcycle India retains the agile handling and responsive performance that riders expect from the brand, continuing to uphold Suzuki’s design philosophy to “Run, Turn, Stop”.

Engineering in Design for Reliable Riding

Battery chemistry is only one piece of the puzzle. How the battery is protected, placed, and tested plays a vital role in ensuring vehicle durability.

The LFP battery in Suzuki e-ACCESS is housed within a rugged aluminium casing and integrated directly into the scooter’s frame for enhanced protection. Further, every battery and component undergo rigorous testing procedures including exposure to extreme heat and cold, submersion, vibration, drop, puncture, crush, and motor bench tests.

This engineering approach and quality assurance measures reflect Suzuki Motorcycle India’s broader manufacturing ethos of building machines that last and minimise the chances of damage in real-world conditions, enhancing rider confidence over the vehicle’s lifespan.

Redefining the Future of E-Mobility

As electric two-wheelers are increasingly becoming a more routine part of urban transport, the value equation is being redefined. Performance now includes not just speed or range, but battery stability, safety, and maintenance costs. In this landscape, the Suzuki e-ACCESS stands out as a vehicle designed not just for today’s commute, but for years of dependable use.

Rather than chasing trends, the brand is clearly focused on building electric vehicles that are robust, rider-friendly, and future-ready. With Suzuki e-ACCESS, company signals its intent to lead with purpose, bringing to market products that reflect deep engineering insight and an understanding of what Indian riders truly need.

To further facilitate this, Suzuki Motorcycle India is actively preparing its existing dealership network to be fully EV-ready across the country. In addition to ensuring widespread availability and easy access, these dealerships are being equipped with trained technical staff and dedicated service infrastructure to meet the specific needs of electric two-wheeler customers. With this robust groundwork in place, Suzuki aims to deliver not just advanced electric vehicles, but also reliable and seamless support throughout the customer’s ownership journey.

According to sources in the health department, although there is a close watch on the rising Covid cases across the country, there is no reason to panic or feel concerned in the state.

Meanwhile, there’s growing concern across the country as Covid-19 cases gradually resurface. States like Andhra Pradesh have already issued precautionary guidelines. According to the Union health ministry, India currently has 257 active cases. West Bengal has recorded a few isolated cases as well. Mumbai reported 95 new Covid cases in May, according to the Maharashtra health department. In Tamil Nadu, 12 new Covid-19 cases were reported. Karnataka confirmed 16 active Covid-19 cases, and in Gujarat, seven new cases were detected in Ahmedabad on a single day.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) Saturday declared the onset of the southwest monsoon in Kerala, 8 days earlier than normal.

Maharashtra and Pune are now next in line in terms of onset.

Incessant rains have been battering parts of Pune over the last few days, leading many to wonder whether monsoon has already arrived in the city.

According to Anupam Kashyapi, former head of weather forecasting at IMD, the most likely date for the onset of monsoon in Pune is May 28.

The IMD declares onset after a series of conditions are met.

Pune and Maharashtra have been witnessing rain over the last few days, which is mainly attributed to the low-pressure area over the Arabian Sea.

The low-pressure areas have caused extensive rainfall in Pune and Maharashtra.

The state has received 99.2 mm of rainfall, more than four times the 20.1 mm of rainfall it is supposed to receive between March 1 and May 31.

If the trend persists, this will be one of the wettest summers the state and city might have seen in a long time.

The recent rains have sparked both anxiety and enthusiasm among farmers. Ganesh Nanote, a farmer from Akola district, noted that the rain has disrupted the pre-sowing land preparation for crops such as moong and urad beans.

“Our main concern is the second week of June. If the current rainfall trend continues, we will have no complaints. However, if that week turns dry, we could face significant problems,” he said.

The IMD Saturday said the onset of monsoons in Kerala was the earliest since 2009, when monsoons arrived on May 23.

It also said that over the next two to three days, favourable conditions will aid the further advance of monsoon into parts of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, more parts of Karnataka, sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim, remaining parts of Tamil Nadu, Goa, and more parts of the central Arabian Sea.

Authorities are closely monitoring the southern coast of Kerala following the capsizing of a Liberian-flagged container ship in the Arabian Sea on Saturday afternoon. The vessel, en route to Kochi Port from Vizhinjam near Thiruvananthapuram, tilted in rough sea conditions before multiple containers — some reportedly carrying “hazardous cargo” —fell into the water and began to sink by Sunday, officials said.

As of Sunday, no oil spill has been reported. However, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information and Services (INCOIS) has warned that if spillage does occur, at least two coastal districts in southern Kerala could face contamination within 36 to 48 hours.

The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) has stayed a notice issued by the Karnataka chief secretary to senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Alok Kumar, Additional Director General of Police, which proposed a departmental inquiry concerning the 2019 phone tapping case.

Kumar argued that the inquiry had already been dropped, as revealed in a Right to Information (RTI) response dated May 6, 2024. He further pointed out that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had filed a ‘B’ (closure) report, concluding that there was no evidence linking him to the alleged audio leak. The CBI had questioned him about the alleged illegal phone tapping of politicians and officials, which occurred during the tenure of Janata Dal (Secular) chief minister H D Kumaraswamy.

Anything that the RSS does, it has to do so keeping in mind that India is a Hindu Rashtra and that is the “eternal thought” of the organisation, RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat said in an interview to Organiser and Panchjanya, weeklies linked to the organisation, published on Sunday. Bhagwat also batted for using power to “eradicate wickedness” in India’s neighbourhood and using the strength of the Hindu society for their protection against persecution in certain countries.

“What is nitya in the Sangh? Balasaheb once said, ‘Hindustan is a Hindu Rashtra.’ Apart from this, everything else in the Sangh is transient. The entire Hindu society is the accountable custodian of this nation. The nature and sanskriti of this country are Hindu. Therefore, this is a Hindu Rashtra,” Bhagwat said.

According to the RSS chief, everything has to be done while maintaining this core idea. “Hence, the Sangh swayamsevak, while taking the oath, explicitly states: ‘The all-round development of the Hindu Rashtra while protecting the sacred Hindu Dharma, Hindu Sanskriti and Hindu society,’” Bhagwat said.

The RSS chief, however, said there was complete freedom to express diverse and conflicting opinions. “The eternal is preserved; the transient evolves with time, space, and context,” he added.

In the backdrop of the Pahalgam attack and the subsequent response from India in Operation Sindoor, Bhagwat articulated his thoughts on national security. According to him, India must worship both virtues and strength. “For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, should be the nature of our power. When no option is available, then wickedness has to be eradicated forcefully. We have no option but to be powerful, as we have been witnessing the wickedness of the evil forces on all our borders.”

Following Operation Sindoor, the RSS chief had lauded the government on the military action against terrorist bases in Pakistan and said the strikes were inevitable for India’s security. The military strikes were something that had “enhanced the self-respect and morale of the whole country”, he added.

Referring to alleged atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government last year, Bhagwat said, “Someone will worry about Hindus only when Hindus are strong enough. As Hindu society and Bharat are intertwined, the glorious nature of Hindu society will bring glory to Bharat. Such a strong Hindu society can only present a model for taking along the people of Bharat who do not consider themselves Hindus, as at one point they were also Hindus,” he said.

According to the RSS chief, if India’s Hindu society becomes strong, then Hindus will automatically gain strength globally. “This work is going on, but it is not yet complete. Slowly but surely, that situation is evolving. This time, the way anguish against the atrocities on Hindus in Bangladesh has been expressed is unprecedented. Even Local Hindus now say, ‘We won’t flee. We’ll stay and fight for our rights,’” Bhagwat said.

“Now, the internal strength of the Hindu society is increasing. As the organisation grows, its impact will translate naturally. Until then, we must keep fighting,” he added.

‘India must guide the world’

Bhagwat said the world was waiting for India to show a new path and that it was a “divine duty”.

“The world is waiting for a new path and Bharat, meaning Hindu society, has to provide it as a divine duty. Agricultural, industrial and scientific revolutions are over. Now the world needs a dharmic revolution — I am not talking about religion, but based on human life has to be reorganised based on truth, purity, compassion, and austerity,” he said.

Bhagwat’s interview was conducted in the context of the RSS centenary this year. On the qualitative expansion of the organisation, he said, “The qualitative and quantitative dimensions are not exclusive to each other; if you neglect one, the other will diminish over a period of time. That’s why the Sangh from day one has decided to organise the entire society, that is, quantitative expansion encompassing all. But this ‘organising’ has a specific meaning and content.

“We have devised certain standards for developing a person as per his temperament and how such individuals should work collectively with the sense of ‘we’ to function as an organisation. We have to grow without breaking the standards or compromising with them, but that does not mean excluding people from the organisation.”

The RSS chief spoke in detail about a socialist leader joining the organisation a few decades ago and struggling with his chain-smoking habit. He narrated how the organisation persuaded the leader to quit after allowing him to smoke a bit.

“Accept people as they are. We have this flexibility. At the same time, we also have the art of affection to transform him as per the need. We have such courage and strength. This is the reason we’ve grown while sustaining quality. We want quality in the organisation, but we also keep in mind that we have to qualitatively transform the entire society,” Bhagwat said.

Rajkummar Rao’s Bhool Chuk Maaf, which released on Friday, has been showing strong performance at the box office. While some sections had written off the film and predicted that it would underperform, the film has proven them wrong. Now, Kamal Gianchandani, Chief Business Planning & Strategy at PVR INOX Limited, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to declare the Rajkummar Rao-starrer a “genuine hit.”

Lauding the film, Kamal wrote, “Some wrote off #BhoolChukMaaf citing ‘discount offers’ or ‘lack of appeal’😇 The box office tells a very different story — it’s a genuine HIT💥 May has revived theatres, audiences are back in big numbers, and the big screens are booming all over the country. 🎬🔥.”

Thanakarn Kanthee, a Thai content creator, passed away a few months ago after accepting an alleged drinking challenge to down 2 bottles of whiskey for a significant amount of money. Known popularly as “Bank Leicester” among his fans, the social media influencer was offered 10,000 Thai baht (₹25,076) per bottle to drink 350ml bottles of Regency whiskey during a birthday celebration in Tha Mai district of Chanthaburi, on Christmas. reported Bangkok Post. Soon after, he collapsed and was rushed to the hospital, where he was declared dead as a result of alcohol poisoning.

Indianexpress.com spoke to health experts and found out what happens to the body when you chug so much alcohol in such a short span of time.

Tanya Khanna, Nutritionist and Yoga Trainer, Alyve Health said that the body is not designed to process alcohol at such a rapid pace. “Typically, the liver can metabolize only one standard drink per hour. A standard drink contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol, which is roughly equivalent to 44 ml of whiskey, 148 ml of wine, or 355 ml of beer. When alcohol is consumed too quickly, the body becomes overwhelmed, leading to severe physiological disruptions,” she said.

According to Khanna, the brain, as the control center of the body, is particularly vulnerable. High concentrations of alcohol impair decision-making, coordination, and motor skills, leading to alcohol poisoning. This disrupts essential functions like breathing, heart rate, and body temperature regulation, which can result in coma or even death.

“Rapid alcohol consumption can trigger arrhythmias, irregular heartbeats, and an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to strokes or heart attacks,” she said. Alcohol also suppresses the respiratory system, and vomiting, often a result of binge drinking, increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia or suffocation. Gastrointestinal distress, including gastritis, ulcers, and pancreatitis, can follow, she added.

Isha Lall, Holistic Nutrition and Gut Health Coach added that drinking two bottles of whiskey (roughly 750 ml each) means consuming over 30 standard drinks. For context, a lethal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is around 0.4%. Downing that much whiskey could easily push you past this limit within minutes. “Initially, you’ll feel euphoric or tipsy. But as levels rise, your coordination falters, speech slurs, and judgment fails. If alcohol levels spike too high, your body’s emergency brakes kick in: vomiting and loss of consciousness. These are your last defenses against alcohol poisoning,” she said.

She suggested the following tips to ensure you drink safely:

1. Pace Yourself: Stick to no more than one drink per hour.

2. Never Drink on an Empty Stomach: Food slows alcohol absorption.

3. Know Your Limit: For most people, two drinks per day is the upper safe limit.

4. Stay Hydrated: Alternate alcohol with water to avoid dehydration.

After visiting Premanand Maharaj in Vrindavan, actor Anushka Sharma and cricketer Virat Kohli were spotted visiting the Hanuman Garhi temple in Ayodhya with their family. On May 25, photos and videos of the couple offering prayers at the temple surfaced on social media.

During their visit, the duo also met Sanjay Dutt, the successor of Mahant Gyan Das of Hanuman Garhi and the national president of the Sankat Mochan Sena. Senior priest Hemant Das helped them with the darshan and other rituals. The priest blessed them with a garland as they offered prayers, and also put ‘teeka’ on the PK actor’s forehead. While Anushka wore a baby pink chikankari suit, Virat, on the other hand, donned a white shirt.

With the race for the playoffs ending sooner than expected in the 18th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL 2025), the quest for the top two spots is still on after three knockout-bound teams — Gujarat Titans, Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings — have lost their respective last games to eliminated teams, making the top two spots available for all qualified teams.

While GT lost to Lucknow Super Giants in a stern 236-run chase, Royal Challengers Bengaluru were dealt with a similar 42-run loss in a chase of 232 against Sunrisers Hyderabad, and PBKS were handed a 6-wicket thrashing by Delhi Capitals.

Only two points separate all four qualified teams as GT sits on top with 18 points, PBKS and RCB both with 17 points, while MI have 16 points all after 13 matches. The teams who finish in the top two will get to play Qualifiers, essentially giving them an extra game and chance to qualify for the finals, as the loser of Qualifier 1 will play the winner of Eliminator — played between the 3rd and 4th ranked teams — for a place in the finals.

Here’s scenarios for all four teams for top-two qualification in IPL 2025

Gujarat Titans: GT have the best chance to consolidate their position at the top. The top-two scenario is fairly straightforward for them: beat Chennai Super Kings, book a spot in Qualifier 1. A win against CSK in their last league game on Sunday will take the Shubman Gill’s side to 20 points, out of reach for all three remaining teams. Even if they lose to CSK, GT can still make it to top two provided that any one of MI, RCB or PBKS lost their last match.

Punjab Kings: Things are not simple for PBKS. They need to beat Mumbai first and hope either GT or RCB lost their last league game to book their berth in the Qualifier 1 match which will be played at their home ground in Mullanpur.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru: The qualification scenario for RCB is exactly the same as PBKS. They need to ensure they win against LSG and hope MI beats PBKS and CSK beats GT. They can afford it if one of GT and PBKS wins their last match, but not both, as this will take matters into NRR. The good thing in RCB’s favour is that they will play the last match of the league stage, so if it comes down to NRR, they will know their target against LSG.

Mumbai Indians: The Hardik Pandya side, who were the last to qualify for playoffs, have a slim chance of a top-two finish. They have to win their last match vs PBKS, which will take MI to 18 points and then hope one of GT or RCB loses their last league game. That’s the only way for MI to play Qualifier 1.

Days after Madhya Pradesh BJP leader Kunwar Vijay Shah apologised for his remarks on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, the soldier who briefed the media on Operation Sindoor, the BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP from Haryana, Ram Chander Jangra, is in the middle of a row after saying that tourists who lost their lives in Pahalgam should have put up a fight against the terrorists and women who lost their husbands in the terror attack “lacked” the spirit of the “warrior women”.

“Wahan par jo hamari veerangnayein behane thee, jinki maang ka sindoor chheen liya gaya, veerangna ka bhaav nahin tha, josh nahin tha, jazba nahin tha, dil nahin tha, isliye haath jod ke goli ka shikaar ho gaye. Lekin haath jodne se koi chhodta nahin. Hamare aadmi vahan par haath jodkar maare gaye (Our sisters who lost their husbands in the attack did not have the warrior spirit or the resolve and vigour to fight back. Therefore, they became victims. Terrorists do not spare those who request with folded hands. Our men died with folded hands),” Jangra said at an event in Bhiwani organised to mark the 300th birth anniversary of Queen Ahilyabai Holkar.

This is not the first time that the 75-year-old has sparked a row. Last December, he alleged that 700 girls had disappeared during the 2020-21 farmers’ agitation on the Delhi border, blaming it on “drug addicts from Punjab”. A day later, he clarified that he had just recounted what people were gossiping about. In November 2021, during the protest, a group of agitated farmers attacked Jangra’s vehicle in Hisar district. The police, however, managed to rescue him.

Active parliamentarian

Known for his proximity to Union Minister and former Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, Ram Chander Jangra is from an Other Backward Class (OBC) community and was appointed to head the welfare board for the state’s Backward Classes and economically weaker sections in 2015. In March 2020, he was picked as the BJP’s Rajya Sabha candidate and entered the Upper House of Parliament, where he is a member of the Committee on Housing and Urban Affairs; the Hindi Salahkar Samiti; the Consultant Committee for Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment; and the Committee on Official Language, among other things. In the Upper House, he has an attendance of over 98% and has participated in over 115 debates so far. He has asked 37 questions so far, including a recent one on “role of women in advancing the goal of Viksit Bharat” on December 11 last year.

Ram Chander Jangra was born in Meham, Rohtak, on May 8, 1950, in a family of farmers. He started his political journey with Lok Dal (Bahuguna), unsuccessfully contesting the Assembly election from Safidon in 1987. In 1991, he contested from Meham on a ticket of the Bansi Lal-led Haryana Vikas Party (HVP), and again from Karnal in 2004. He lost both elections. He moved to the BJP after the HVP merged with the Congress. He was appointed the state president of the party’s OBC wing and received an Assembly poll ticket again in 2014 when he was fielded from Gohana. His luck, however, did not turn, and he lost again.

Five years later, Jangra was again in the running for the Gohana ticket, but this time, the party went with Tirath Rana. But Rana, too, failed as the Congress’s Jagbir Malik retained the seat for the party. The following year, the party decided to send Jangra to Parliament and following the announcement of his nomination, the veteran leader described himself as a “true soldier of the party”.

“I had been working as the party’s ordinary worker for years. Whatever duty was ever assigned to me, I fulfilled it with utmost honesty and dedication. This time too, I will do the same,” he said at the time.

Meanwhile, while talking to The Brut at Cannes, Alia Bhatt expressed her feelings about walking the red carpet for the first time and said, “This is my first time at Cannes with L’Oreal Paris. You talk so much about it leading up to it. Also with the years, ever since the social media boom, I think around this time, everybody is on their phone looking at the red carpet looks, looking at the beauty looks. I for one, have actually grown up watching Aishwarya Rai Bachchan walk the carpet in all her glory, representing India on this global stage, and it’s always such a huge inspiration.”

“It’s a pinch-me moment to be here, and it’s actually really lovely energy. The city is buzzing. There’s so much happy positive vibes around. We are all here to actually celebrate cinema, but you are also here to celebrate the coming together of people from different parts of the world. I find that has a different sort of encouragement when you just interact with people and get to know where they are coming from and what their creative input is into cinema or to fashion or to beauty or to anything like that,” she added.

In a video that has gone viral now, Bhatt is seen being approached by an elderly woman who wished to take a selfie with her. The heartwarming moment unfolded as the fan handed her phone to the actor, who then sweetly asked for the passcode, entered it herself, and snapped the selfie.

Eliminated Delhi Capitals stun playoff-bound Punjab Kings with a fine run-chase in Jaipur to keep IPL 2025’s top-two race open

For a third straight game, an eliminated team thrashed an already qualified team in the Indian Premier League to spice up the race for the top-two in an otherwise humdrum business end of the tournament. Delhi Capitals ended their IPL 2025 campaign on a high, handing Punjab Kings a 6-wicket loss at Jaipur’s Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Saturday in what was a repeat clash of the abandoned match in Dharamsala.

Nair, Rizvi deliver

On a day when “dear” cricket finally gave Karun Nair a long-awaited chance — earning an India Test call-up after nearly eight years — it didn’t take much time for the domestic stalwart to return the favours. In a challenging 207-run chase, the battle-hardened Nair delivered his A-game after openers Faf du Plessis and KL Rahul laid a strong foundation for Delhi.

The chase threatened to unravel with the openers falling, but the dismissal of Afghan IPL debutant Sediqullah Atal by Praveen Dubey somehow fueled Nair even more as he hammered the leggies for four consecutive fours.

Nair’s valiant effort was ultimately overshadowed by a clutch innings by Sameer Rizvi as he smashed a blistering 58 off just 25. With 52 needing off the last five, Arshdeep Singh put an instant choke, conceding just four off the 16th over. Rizvi then broke free and hit a clean strike over long-on before Tristan Stubbs ended Harpreet Brar’s effective spell with a four. Rizvi slapped Azmatullah Omarzai for a couple of boundaries, making a realistic target for DC of 22 off 12 from 34 off 18. The result became academic when the UP League star swivel-pulled Arshdeep for six, followed by Stubbs’ scoop for four in the penultimate over.

Shreyas shines

There’s an undeniable swagger in Shreyas Iyer — in his antics, his posture, the ever-present smirk, and his trademark gum-chewing. His batting usually reflects that omnipresent conviction, but on a night when Punjab openers lost the track early for the second consecutive game, it was skipper Iyer’s composure and not the exuberance that steadied the ship. Australian powerhouse Marcus Stoinis then arrived late to fulfil the team’s swag quota in his explosive fashion.

While wickets tumbled at regular intervals from the other end, Iyer kept the scoreboard moving, stitching together four partnerships of 20-plus runs. Iyer demoted himself to No. 5, sending Josh Inglis ahead after the early dismissal of Priyansh Arya. The move was worthwhile till it lasted, as Inglis kept the tempo high, blitzing to a 12-ball 32. Iyer, who got off the mark with a four, slapping it past short cover off Vipraj Nigam, hit his fifth half-century of the season.

For Delhi, Mustafizur Rahman impressed with his cutters and variations. DC seized the middle overs, denying Punjab any boundaries for 18 balls with Nehal Wadhera and Shashank back in the hut. The momentum shifted DC’s way before Stoinis’s muscle show was on. Coming in to bat in the 16th over, he struck three fours and four sixes to get 44 off 16, taking Punjab over the 200 mark for the seventh time this season while batting first. But it wasn’t to be enough in the end as they face an anxious wait for top-two.

Brief scores: Punjab Kings 206/8 (Shreyas Iyer 53, Mustafizur Rahman 3/33) lost to Delhi Capitals 208/4 in 19.3 overs (Sameer Rizvi 58, Harpreet Brar 2/41) by 6 wickets

SYNOPSIS: Sunrisers Hyderabad recorded an unlikely Lucknow double in successive high-scoring games to diminish Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s hopes of a top-two finish

After thumping Lucknow Super Giants in a sizzling 205-run chase on Monday, SRH disrupted RCB’s spotless six-match away-winning streak with refined performances across departments. Powered by Ishan Kishan’s first significant score in two months and RCB’s 233-run chase progressively spiralling out of control, SRH eventually notched up a comfortable 42-run win at the Ekana Stadium.

Openers in sync

Three weeks since RCB’s last outing and his first sighting back with the bat since hanging up his Test whites 11 days ago, Friday’s Virat Kohli was cut from a cloth he would have perhaps relished during his prolonged red-ball lull this decade. The former India Test No. 4’s imperceptible back-foot play was often cited during a parched Test stretch.

But when Kohli pressed back in the crease to smear Pat Cummins’ loose ball outside off-stump, a blazing cut sped to the backward point fence off the first delivery he faced in a steep chase.

An expertly curated tap through mid-off, deep from the crease off left-armer Jaydev Unadkat in the second over hinted at a changing Kohli in his most favoured setting of a high-pressure chase. More vigorous in his movements back, forth and across the depths of the crease, Kohli smothered pace with unusually balletic feet and stinging dexterity. Turning up for the first time in a month, a returning Phil Salt only found his radar towards the end of the first-six, by which time Kohli had equalled his best Powerplay shares in an IPL innings, gathering 42 of the 72-run stand in 22 deliveries.

But in tempestuous conformity to his final Test season, Kohli fell abruptly in the seventh over with an exaggerated back-foot slice off left-arm tweaker Harsh Dubey falling in Abhishek Sharma’s palms, at backward point.

A fledgling 21-year-old Kohli and his masterful self at 35 were unbeaten on the only two occasions RCB had previously chased down 200-plus scores in the IPL in 2010 and 2024. Keeping up the top-two hopes on the lively Lucknow pitch was a refreshing Salt procession.

Doubling his Powerplay start in a flash, Salt ground the lengths of the slower bowlers into smithereens with eight boundaries in a 27-ball fifty, shredding the chunky target by half at the 10-over mark.

But for a couple of wickets in succession, marked by Salt’s miscued skier to mid-off triggered, slow panic struck the RCB camp. Nitish Reddy’s tight 15th over, the first in the innings with no boundaries, summoned improbable doom. The chase fizzled out within five balls of harakiri as Rajat Patidar’s sloppy run-out and Romario Shepherd’s tame chip culminated in stand-in skipper Jitesh Sharma’s faltering slog-sweep to the deep mid-wicket fielder.

Reduced to one knee after troubling his hamstring patrolling the fence earlier in the night, Tim David could not muster enough muscle for momentum to lead the side past 200, leaving RCB with growing concerns six days out from the Playoffs.

Saving the blushes

On a dark and devious strip where both teams were uncertain of batting first, the Sunrisers curiously conjured up a start that stood true to their nature, igniting the plot for a freakishly high score. But as has been the wont through a patchy league phase, SRH’s big boys failed to sustain the fireworks in the first half. While they seemed to end up short on gunpowder to last the full 20, Ishan Kishan finally emerged from hibernation.

For once in 11 outings since his stellar franchise debut in Hyderabad in March with a statement hundred, Kishan was cautious with the jabs and pulls. Openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head had earlier teased to scorch the rusty RCB bowlers but were stopped in their tracks within the Powerplay.

Preempting Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s stingy lines on the stumps, Abhishek dazzled with his proactive nous. A charged side-step to hoist a straight delivery over long-off the first ball he faced off the veteran seamer prompted Bhuvneshwar to abandon his search for swing and lodge the ball short, only to see Abhishek waiting to deposit the off-cutter over mid-wicket for six.

Firing on all cylinders has been ingrained into the ‘Travishek’ label, but the sorry tune of the season continued as the volatile southpaws imploded, playing a shot too many even as they punched past 50 within 21 balls.

For the last 21 deliveries of the innings, SRH’s frenzy juices were limited after six casualties, left to Kishan salvage his strange season that began with a promising 106 not out and constricted to 125 runs in 10 innings thereafter. As SRH peppered 51 from 16.3 overs onwards, Kishan crammed in 37, an unbeaten 48-ball 94 relieving some of the built-up burden.

Patience at the crease bore fruition as a thunderous slog-sweep off Krunal Pandya and a meaty one-hander over the long-on fence from Bhuvneshwar’s 18th over reaffirmed Kishan’s range and his unfulfilled potential within another middling season.

Brief Scores: Sunrisers Hyderabad 231/6 (94* off 48b; R Shepherd 2/14) beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru 189 in 19.5 overs (P Salt 62 off 32b, V Kohli 43 off 25; P Cummins 3/28) by 42 runs.

Chennai Super Kings huff and puff to an underwhelming total, and even Rajasthan Royals, with a history of messing up from winning positions, couldn’t squander this opportunity.

A contest between the 9th and 10th-placed teams in the competition should theoretically have been close. But it showed how far behind the rest the old warhorses of Chennai Super Kings have fallen. At the Arun Jaitley Stadium, which has seen some big scores set and chased, their 187 was woefully inadequate. Their batsmen have underperformed this season, and their bowlers – especially the spinners – were also found wanting. A six-wicket defeat to fellow strugglers Rajasthan Royals, with as many as 17 balls to spare, would be a chastening experience.

Royals stay true to ethos

It was a game between two cellar-dwellers, but even with nothing at stake in the larger context of the tournament, it was evident that one team relied on youth while the other seemed suspicious of it. On the eve of the game, CSK head coach Stephen Fleming had said that his side will continue to bank on experience as it had brought them trophies.

Well, there’s a word for doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result. It’s not smartness. RR were battling to avoid finishing last, but they have chosen to swim or sink with their youngsters. And despite botching up several winnable chases this season, skipper Sanju Samson needs to be commended for biting the bullet and deciding to bowl first.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi has caught the eye with his shot-making and derring-do, Tuesday gave him an opportunity to show some maturity in a chase. He lost opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal relatively early – albeit after another whirlwind start – and the 14-year-old had to build a partnership with his captain.

The two did that with consummate ease and the 98-run second-wicket stand, off 59 balls, broke the back of the chase. When Ravichandran Ashwin dismissed both set batsmen in the same over, the ghosts of old chases may have returned to haunt RR, but Dhruv Jurel and Shimron Hetmyer didn’t let the game get interesting as a flurry of boundaries, aided by some shoddy CSK bowling, finished proceedings in quick time. Unless something drastic happens against Gujarat Titans in their last game, Dhoni’s team is destined to finish at the bottom.

Muddled thinking

There’s a time-tested adage in limited-overs cricket which says that a team’s best batters should get the opportunity to face the maximum number of deliveries. Of late, this theory has been upended by the fad called ‘entry points’, which prompted the sight of spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Ashwin in the middle – with the bat – even before the Powerplay was over. Teenager Ayush Mhatre had injected momentum in the CSK innings after two early wickets with a 20-ball 43, but with the hitting power of Dewald Brevis and Shivam Dube in the dugout, the team management chose to use the veteran spin duo.

As it turned out, Brevis and Dube found themselves in the middle with less than eight overs bowled, but with half the side dismissed. It helped that the run rate was close to 10, so the duo had some leeway. They did their best, with the South African – clearly one of the brighter spots in a dismal season for CSK – playing some sparkling shots in his 25-ball 42. Dube tried to take on the mantle thereafter, only with limited success, with his 32-ball 39 helping the team to a total of 187/8, with the second half of the innings bringing only 85 runs.

It was a sporadic innings with a couple of decent knocks. The muddled thinking behind some of the decisions also doesn’t help much.

Shadow of a giant

Dhoni has made a name for himself by taking the game deep and making it a one-on-one contest with the bowler in a who-blinks-first situation. But at this stage of his career, he seems to be taking the game deep even when his team bats first. What else can explain an innings of 17-ball 16 after coming to bat with 6.2 overs left? That included a straight six off part-time off-spinner Riyan Parag. The other 16 balls the CSK skipper faced brought 10 runs. The large crowd, dotted with CSK shirts which gave him a grand reception before and during the game, roared in anticipation whenever Dhoni swung his bat, but the desired connection eluded him.

At the toss, he had said that the last few games of this IPL season were useful in planning for the future. The franchise had “one eye already on next year, which individuals can play a part,” Dhoni had said. The franchise, and the player himself, have a few decisions to make.

Brief scores: Chennai Super Kings 187/8 in 20 overs (Mhatre 43, Brevis 42, Shivam Dube 39; Madhwal 3/29, Yudhvir Singh 3/47) lost to Rajasthan Royals 188/4 in 17.1 overs (Suryavanshi 57, Samson 41, Jaiswal 36, Jurel 31 not out) by 6 wickets

As the curtains came down for Lucknow Super Giants at the Ekana Stadium on Monday, Rishabh Pant trudged himself to the dugout with bowed head before he pulled off his gloves with a wry smile. On the night he had seen his batsmen put up another good show, which although looked incomplete seemed fine, before the holes in Lucknow’s bowling resurfaced to drag them down. That they were only the fifth team to be eliminated in itself was credible as all along they have carried an attack without any bite. But invariably, the cameras were all trained on Pant.

Not without reasons, though. He had already made a rallying cry to not single him out for his team’s performances. “Every time if you take out the individual, it’s not the right thing to do,” he had said earlier. However, through the course of this season, Pant has given enough reasons to be the talking point.

The costliest player ever at the auction, purchased for Rs 27 crore, his move from Delhi Capitals to Lucknow – with KL Rahul going the other way around and just touching distance from tallying 500 runs for the season – as a captain was bound to bring more scrutiny. From a franchise where he seemed tired of the constant juggle in the operations front, he was now in a set-up where his predecessor was pulled up by the team’s owner in full public view. As a captain as well, Pant was hardly an inspirational figure at Delhi Capitals.

T20 flaws

Beyond all these, there were questions about Pant’s credentials as a T20 batsman. While there is little doubt that the spot in India’s Test side is his, the same hasn’t been said in white-ball cricket. They haven’t been without reasons. Unpredictable and adventurous, his 360-degree range had everything in it to succeed in T20s. Last season, playing his first competitive fixture since the horrific accident, he scored 446 at a strike-rate of 150.40 to walk into India’s T20 World Cup squad.

That seems a long time ago now. In 11 innings this season, his scores read: 0, 15, 2, 2, 21, 63, 3, 0, 4, 18 and 7. A grand total of 135 runs at a strike-rate of 100. At the beginning, it appeared as if it was only a matter of time before he found the runs. A new franchise, pressure of being the expensive player, and headaches to solve as a captain, may all have weighed in. However, for Pant’s own bad, it only got worse since then with his decision-making on the field also under the spotlight. While there hasn’t been an alarming trend of dismissal to press panic button, that he has been reticent with his shot-making is enough to send worrying signs ahead of the big tour to England.

As former India captain Kris Srikkanth mentioned on his YouTube channel, it has been a season where Pant has found ways to get dismissed – a sign of a batsman not high on confidence. Pant in full song is as adventurous a batsman can get, who can make jaws drop with his shot selection alone. There is always an air of audacity when he is in flow, which has been clearly missing this IPL. “Unfortunately things are not going Pant’s way,” Srikkanth said. “Even with the bat, he can just play freely and be bold, but he seems to be playing half-hearted shots with no clarity. Every game he is finding new ways to get dismissed. During my playing days I used to invent ways to get dismissed and Pant is doing worse than me,” the former chairman of selectors lamented.

Given these struggles, it is pertinent to ask whether India’s team management and the selectors have erred in not sending Pant early to England. With India’s batting line-up going through a huge transition with the retirement of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, alongside KL Rahul, he is the most experienced batsman in English conditions. While he will definitely feature in the intra-squad match before the first Test, it is worth considering his inclusion for the second India A fixture. For, Pant’s struggles haven’t been limited to the IPL.

Even in the Australia tour, his first score of 40 or above came in the last innings of the five-Test tour, in Sydney. It meant, when the white-ball season began, he was pushed to the fringes and warmed the bench throughout the victorious Champions Trophy campaign. Unlike the ODI and T20s, where India have other options, in Tests India need Pant. Given this IPL, Pant needs Tests. It is one format where he has truly found value for his breathtaking batting, but given how unconventional the Bazballers can get with their field placements and how they like to play with batsmen’s ego, the five Tests in England would be no less challenging.

How and where Pant will turn the corner around is the biggest question.

Adani to Ambani: Sibal gets India Inc to pay Rs 50 crore for lawyers’ health cover

1 hr ago

Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, who has raised Rs 50 crore from a few big industrialists to fund a group medical insurance policy for the Bar’s members, has met with opposition from a section within the association. “As the new SCBA president, my first endeavour will be to discuss this policy in the Executive Committee meeting... My personal view is that this policy definitely needs to be renegotiated or scrapped, because the premium that we are paying for a Rs 2 lakh cover is highly disproportionate to the premium that we pay for a Rs 5 lakh cover,” Senior Advocate Vikas Singh, who was elected the new president of the Bar body last week, told The Indian Express. At a General Body Meeting of the SCBA on May 5, Singh had expressed his opposition. To a question on whether Sibal’s endeavour raised issues of conflict of interest, Singh said it depends on whether these are CSR funds. “There is no conflict if its not CSR funds as the money is given to the association and not to any individual,” he said. When contacted, Sibal said, “There is no conflict of interest here. Where is the question? The donation is to the association and not to any member. Moreover, personally, I have and may appear again against or in favour of many of these companies. And I charge them. Our professional career is not based on our friendships.” Sibal said Mukesh Ambani (Reliance Industries) contributed Rs 10 crore, while Anil Ambani (Reliance Group), Gautam Adani (Adani Group), N Chandrasekharan (Tata Sons), Samir Mehta (Torrent Group), G M Rao (GMR Group), Kumar Mangalam Birla (Aditya Birla Group), Anil Aggarwal (Vedanta) and Lakshmi Mittal (ArcelorMittal) gave Rs 5 crore each. He said corporates would get tax exemption under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. Donations made to specified institutions are allowed to be deducted from the taxable income under Section 80G. SCBA’s new President Singh said his attempt would be (to ensure) that this policy was made available only to needy members of the Bar or members who support elderly parents. “It should not be made available for people like us. The policy, as announced by the earlier Executive Committee, is meant for everybody, including me, Mr Sibal etc. This kind of money can never be utilised for that…All this will be done only after discussing with my Executive Committee.” According to Sibal, 95 per cent of lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court do not earn well. “They come from all over the country to Delhi…to practise…most of them are not earning well… they have to spend money on rent, their families… and if they fall ill, have to foot medical bills.” He said there are about 2,700-2,800 members of the SCBA who have voting rights, and will be eligible for the health cover. Addressing an event organised by the SCBA on May 21, Sibal explained how he went about raising the money. “I started sort of collecting from those who I have served for the last 52 years... I rang up Anil Aggarwal of Vedanta. He readily agreed and gave us a contribution of Rs 5 crore. I rang up Anil Ambani, a dear friend of mine, and he had no choice but to say yes. So he gave Rs 5 crore. I rang up the GMR Group, both Mr Rao as well as Mr Bhaskar Chandran... and they said, ‘Sir, now that you have asked, we will make sure that it happens’, and it happened, Rs 5 crore,” said Sibal. “I rang up Gautam Adani, and I said it’s time for you to contribute because you are more or less the emperor of India now and Rs 5 crore is too little for you. He said if you want more, I will give more, but here is Rs 5 crore. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” Sibal said. “Mr Kumar Mangalam Birla, again an old friend of mine... served the Birla empire for many years…never asked them for anything. So I said, another Rs 5 crore from you, and he said yes,” he said. “Then I rang up another friend of mine, Lakshmi Mittal from London. He picked up the phone and I made that request. He said somebody will get in touch with you soon. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” he said. “Then again, Mukesh Ambani. I knew Dhirubhai Ambani when I was a young lawyer and we had a very warm relationship…These boys were kids and they used to come to me and I used to do most of their matters in Bombay. So I asked him and he said how much do you want. I said Rs 10 crore. He said you will have the cheque soon. So he gave Rs 10 crore,” Sibal said. “Then I rang up Natarajan Chandrasekaran of Tata, whom I also know very well…and he also did not hesitate. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” the senior counsel said. “And from the Torrent Group, Mr Samir Mehta, again a good friend of mine, and, in fact, Dushyant Dave told me, if he doesn’t give it, let me know, I will make a call to him. But it didn’t really happen. I asked him, he gave Rs 5 crore... In this process, we have Rs 50 crore with us,” Sibal said. He also outlined what was done after raising the amount. “I contacted Apollo group, who are also my clients. I know the head of the family, head of the Apollo group is an old friend of mine. So I said look, we want you to handle this. He sort of looked at the market and got hold of a company called the National Insurance Company. And we started talking to the National Insurance Company as to what kind of benefits our young lawyers can get. I want to tell you… there is no insurance policy in this country that gives so many benefits as this one does,” he said. Chief Justice of India B R Gavai, who also addressed the event, congratulated the SCBA for raising Rs 50 crore. “Undoubtedly, this is a remarkable achievement that reflects deep concern for the welfare of the legal community,” he said. Pointing to the difficulties that young lawyers face with no regular income to meet their needs, the CJI said: “Providing good health insurance, therefore, is not just a welfare measure, it is a vital support system. It offers the lawyers a degree of financial security and peace of mind in times of medical need.”

He said corporates would get tax exemption under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. Donations made to specified institutions are allowed to be deducted from the taxable income under Section 80G. SCBA’s new President Singh said his attempt would be (to ensure) that this policy was made available only to needy members of the Bar or members who support elderly parents. “It should not be made available for people like us. The policy, as announced by the earlier Executive Committee, is meant for everybody, including me, Mr Sibal etc. This kind of money can never be utilised for that…All this will be done only after discussing with my Executive Committee.” According to Sibal, 95 per cent of lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court do not earn well. “They come from all over the country to Delhi…to practise…most of them are not earning well… they have to spend money on rent, their families… and if they fall ill, have to foot medical bills.” He said there are about 2,700-2,800 members of the SCBA who have voting rights, and will be eligible for the health cover. Addressing an event organised by the SCBA on May 21, Sibal explained how he went about raising the money. “I started sort of collecting from those who I have served for the last 52 years... I rang up Anil Aggarwal of Vedanta. He readily agreed and gave us a contribution of Rs 5 crore. I rang up Anil Ambani, a dear friend of mine, and he had no choice but to say yes. So he gave Rs 5 crore. I rang up the GMR Group, both Mr Rao as well as Mr Bhaskar Chandran... and they said, ‘Sir, now that you have asked, we will make sure that it happens’, and it happened, Rs 5 crore,” said Sibal. “I rang up Gautam Adani, and I said it’s time for you to contribute because you are more or less the emperor of India now and Rs 5 crore is too little for you. He said if you want more, I will give more, but here is Rs 5 crore. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” Sibal said. “Mr Kumar Mangalam Birla, again an old friend of mine... served the Birla empire for many years…never asked them for anything. So I said, another Rs 5 crore from you, and he said yes,” he said. “Then I rang up another friend of mine, Lakshmi Mittal from London. He picked up the phone and I made that request. He said somebody will get in touch with you soon. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” he said. “Then again, Mukesh Ambani. I knew Dhirubhai Ambani when I was a young lawyer and we had a very warm relationship…These boys were kids and they used to come to me and I used to do most of their matters in Bombay. So I asked him and he said how much do you want. I said Rs 10 crore. He said you will have the cheque soon. So he gave Rs 10 crore,” Sibal said. “Then I rang up Natarajan Chandrasekaran of Tata, whom I also know very well…and he also did not hesitate. So he gave Rs 5 crore,” the senior counsel said. “And from the Torrent Group, Mr Samir Mehta, again a good friend of mine, and, in fact, Dushyant Dave told me, if he doesn’t give it, let me know, I will make a call to him. But it didn’t really happen. I asked him, he gave Rs 5 crore... In this process, we have Rs 50 crore with us,” Sibal said. He also outlined what was done after raising the amount. “I contacted Apollo group, who are also my clients. I know the head of the family, head of the Apollo group is an old friend of mine. So I said look, we want you to handle this. He sort of looked at the market and got hold of a company called the National Insurance Company. And we started talking to the National Insurance Company as to what kind of benefits our young lawyers can get. I want to tell you… there is no insurance policy in this country that gives so many benefits as this one does,” he said. Chief Justice of India B R Gavai, who also addressed the event, congratulated the SCBA for raising Rs 50 crore. “Undoubtedly, this is a remarkable achievement that reflects deep concern for the welfare of the legal community,” he said. Pointing to the difficulties that young lawyers face with no regular income to meet their needs, the CJI said: “Providing good health insurance, therefore, is not just a welfare measure, it is a vital support system. It offers the lawyers a degree of financial security and peace of mind in times of medical need.”

Ace movie review: Coincidences happen; they can be nice and fun too, particularly in crime and action comedies. But relying solely on coincidences at almost every juncture is simply convenient and lazy writing. Writer-director Arumuga Kumar’s Ace proves exactly that.

From the moment Vijay Sethupathi’s character lands in Malaysia, his life becomes a series of conveniently crafted “coincidences”. Immediately after stepping out of the airport, Arivu (Yogi Babu) appears before him ‘out of the blue’. In an extremely clichéd moment, Arivu asks him if he is Bolt Kannan, claiming “this is what he would look like” and then proceeds to rattle off all sorts of details about Kannan. For someone who is definitely not Bolt Kannan but is in dire need of a disguise, this is just too convenient to pass up. Without asking for any ID or proof (and that too in this era), Arivu confirms that he is Kannan and takes him to live in a neighbourhood largely inhabited by Tamils. The real Bolt Kannan was summoned to Malaysia to work as a chef at a food joint run by Arivu’s love interest, Kalpana (Divya Pillai), and thus Vijay’s character conveniently lands a job as well. Totally coincidental.

In his new neighbourhood, he meets a pretty young woman, Rukmini Vasanth, in an eponymous role, and they, of course, have a rocky start. Nonetheless, he immediately develops feelings for her. Then, they keep running into each other, not just in their locality, but in other parts of the city too, as if someone is scripting their story and desperately wants them to keep meeting so they can eventually fall in love. The coincidences keep stacking up. At the exact moment when Rukmini wants some people to be beaten up, Kannan appears and does the job, completely altering her opinion of him. And before long, she falls for him; totally coincidental, especially considering the film offers no proper explanation for her change of heart. All we’re shown is the two of them talking and laughing, with a song, “Urugudhu Urugudhu,” playing in the background. I thought such unimaginative storytelling was a thing of the past. Clearly not.

As if these weren’t enough, both Kalpana and Rukmini are facing conveniently timed financial crises. Kalpana needs a large sum to settle a bank debt tied to her food joint, while Rukmini needs a huge amount to escape the clutches of her ruthless stepfather, police officer Raja Dorai (portrayed extremely poorly by Babloo Prithiveeraj). But fret not; Kannan is here to save the day. A pro poker player, he tries to make money through gambling. However, his plan backfires (probably one of the few times things don’t go his way), and he ends up just as deeply in debt to mafia don Dharma (a decent BS Avinash). Desperate, he robs a bank. And yes, the heist is just as casually written as it sounds — rushed and completely devoid of tension or planning. Meanwhile, Kannan also wins a jackpot worth nearly the same amount he stole; just imagine the level of coincidences that happen in his life.

Watch Ace trailer here:

However, the police soon get some clues regarding the robber and commence a probe. From that point on, while the sheer level of convenience and coincidences starts to taper off and a few obstacles come Kannan’s way, things don’t improve significantly. Kumar continues to take the easy routes, throwing in some half-baked thriller elements too, thereby ruining even the slight potential this part of the narrative had.

Although Ace had the potential to be a thrilling and fun crime comedy, the intrigue at its core is completely undermined by Kumar’s extremely lazy writing. Laden with overused tropes and painfully clichéd jokes, Ace is not only poorly constructed but even more poorly executed, ultimately turning the film into a complete trainwreck.

Another major drawback of the film is its unnecessary subplots, particularly the one involving Raja Dorai. While we repeatedly see him blackmailing a young woman with her sex tape, one would naturally expect this aspect or her character to play a more significant role in the larger narrative. But no; she is simply reduced to a background presence with no meaningful development or resolution.

Also, how much longer will Tamil cinema continue to recycle the same tasteless jokes at Yogi Babu’s expense? In this film, he’s portrayed as a sanitation worker, and no, the makers’ intentions don’t appear noble. This becomes clear in the way the film attempts to extract humour from Arivu’s job. On top of that, the movie also relies heavily on tired ‘jokes’ about his appearance. To mock someone whose skin tone and body type reflect a large segment of the Dravidian population is not only tone-deaf but also deeply offensive and regressive.

Meanwhile, as conversations around the disturbing age gap between Kamal Haasan and Trisha Krishnan in the upcoming Thug Life continue, Ace falls into a similar trap by pairing a 28-year-old Rukmini opposite a 47-year-old Vijay Sethupathi. While their romance is handled with a certain degree of grace and the two do share charming on-screen chemistry, the age difference is impossible to ignore. It begs the question: was there really no alternative to pairing these two actors, if not for the entrenched patriarchal mindset that male leads are “ageless”, while their female counterparts are not? The makers could have easily chosen an age-appropriate casting by retaining just one of them; the fact that they didn’t speaks volumes.

Amidst all its issues, what works in Ace’s favour is the adorable chemistry between the lead cast. Vijay Sethupathi and Yogi Babu are a delight to watch, making one wish for a better film that does justice to their dynamic. Vijay and Rukmini’s interactions also bring a certain warmth and spark to the screen. While none of the performances are particularly remarkable, especially considering these actors have delivered far stronger work in the past, they do their best with what they’ve been given. Karan B Rawat’s cinematography, Justin Prabhakaran’s enchanting music and Sam CS’s exceptional background score also contribute to keeping the film from becoming a complete disaster.

Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday for his revenge thriller It Was Just an Accident, handing the festival’s top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years.

Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film (This Is Not a Film) made in his living room, and another (Taxi) set in a car.

The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 in Cannes held up Panahi’s name to honor the director when he was under house arrest.

On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country.

“Let us join forces,” said Panahi. “No one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing.”

The win for It Was Just an Accident extended an unprecedented streak: The indie distributor Neon has now backed the last six Palme d’Or winners. The latest triumph for Neon, which acquired It Was Just an Accident for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for Parasite, Titane, Triangle of Sadness, Anatomy of a Fall and Anora.

Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said that unlike his friend Rasoulof, life in exile isn’t for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.

It Was Just an Accident was inspired by Panahi’s experience in prison. In the film, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.

Panahi was jailed in Tehran’s Evin Prison after going there to inquire about the then-jailed Rasoulof. Panahi was released in 2023 after going on a hunger strike.

In 2009, he was banned from traveling out of Iran after attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests. Through those years, Panahi continued to make films illegally in Iran, without a permit, and had his films smuggled to festivals on USB drives. His travel ban was lifted after his release in 2023.

“The film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,” Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. “Art will always win. What is human will always win.”

The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes.

“A day without electricity,” sighed John C. Reilly, who sang an English-language “La Vie En Rose” at the ceremony. The festival’s films, he said, supplied “all the needed electricity.”

Other winners at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival

The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier’s Norwegian family drama Sentimental Value, his lauded follow-up to The Worst Person in the World. Some had expected Sentimental Value to win the Palme, but Trier — whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve — still took a major prize.

“We live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,” said Trier. “And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.”

Kleber Mendonça Filho’s Brazilian political thriller The Secret Agent won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for The Secret Agent showed the jury’s strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, “That was our wish.”

The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles’ I’m Still Here in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said the awards “show that our country’s cinema is second to none.”

The jury prize was split between two films: Óliver Laxe’s desert road trip Sirât and Mascha Schilinski’s German, generation-spanning drama Sound of Falling. Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for The Little Sister, Hafsia Herzi’s French coming-of-age drama.

The Belgian brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, who are two-time Palme d’Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, Young Mothers. Its their ninth prize in Cannes. The festival’s award for best first film, the Camera d’Or, went to Hasan Hadi for The President’s Cake, making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.

What else shaped Cannes this year

Saturday’s ceremony brought to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world’s largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.

Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. “Can you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn’t ship that way,” said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, The Phoenician Scheme at the festival. At the opening ceremony, honorary Palme d’Or recipient Robert De Niro called Trump “America’s philistine president.”

Other top American films in Cannes included Spike Lee’s Highest 2 Lowest (which pulled Lee away from his New York Knicks but not out of their blue and orange color), the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner Mission: Impossible — Final Reckoning, and Ari Aster’s Eddington, which found a divisive reaction.

Panahi’s win put him in rare company. He’s now won Cannes’ Palme d’Or, Venice’s Golden Lion (for The Circle) and Berlin’s Golden Bear (for Taxi). Only three other filmmakers have done that: Henri-Georges Clouzot, Michelangelo Antonioni and Robert Altman.

Addressing reporters after his win, Panahi spoke about filmmakers and artists always being able to find a way, “even in complicated situations.”

“They must realize that no powers that be can halt such people in their tracks,” said Panahi. “You have this power.”

Adani to Ambani: Sibal gets India Inc to pay Rs 50 crore for lawyers’ health cover

1 hr ago

Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, who has raised Rs 50 crore from a few big industrialists to fund a group medical insurance policy for the Bar’s members, has met with opposition from a section within the association. “As the new SCBA president, my first endeavour will be to discuss this policy in the Executive Committee meeting... My personal view is that this policy definitely needs to be renegotiated or scrapped, because the premium that we are paying for a Rs 2 lakh cover is highly disproportionate to the premium that we pay for a Rs 5 lakh cover,” Senior Advocate Vikas Singh, who was elected the new president of the Bar body last week, told The Indian Express. At a General Body Meeting of the SCBA on May 5, Singh had expressed his opposition. To a question on whether Sibal’s endeavour raised issues of conflict of interest, Singh said it depends on whether these are CSR funds. “There is no conflict if its not CSR funds as the money is given to the association and not to any individual,” he said. When contacted, Sibal said, “There is no conflict of interest here. Where is the question? The donation is to the association and not to any member. Moreover, personally, I have and may appear again against or in favour of many of these companies. And I charge them. Our professional career is not based on our friendships.” Sibal said Mukesh Ambani (Reliance Industries) contributed Rs 10 crore, while Anil Ambani (Reliance Group), Gautam Adani (Adani Group), N Chandrasekharan (Tata Sons), Samir Mehta (Torrent Group), G M Rao (GMR Group), Kumar Mangalam Birla (Aditya Birla Group), Anil Aggarwal (Vedanta) and Lakshmi Mittal (ArcelorMittal) gave Rs 5 crore each. He said corporates would get tax exemption under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. Donations made to specified institutions are allowed to be deducted from the taxable income under Section 80G. SCBA’s new President Singh said his attempt would be (to ensure) that this policy was made available only to needy members of the Bar or members who support elderly parents. “It should not be made available for people like us. The policy, as announced by the earlier Executive Committee, is meant for everybody, including me, Mr Sibal etc. This kind of money can never be utilised for that…All this will be done only after discussing with my Executive Committee.” According to Sibal, 95 per cent of lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court do not earn well. “They come from all over the country to Delhi…to practise…most of them are not earning well… they have to spend money on rent, their families… and if they fall ill, have to foot medical bills.” He said there are about 2,700-2,800 members of the SCBA who have voting rights, and will be eligible for the health cover.

The yesteryear star Mumtaz, who stole hearts with her performances in movies like Prem Kahani (1975), Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971), Chor Machay Shor (1974), and Sacha Jhuta (1970), talked about the impossible beauty standards actors have to maintain and shared some interesting anecdotes about her co-stars. While talking to Radio Nasha, she first shared how hard it is to maintain a certain look as time passes, but said that her fans still shower her with the same love and appreciation all these years later. “People come up to me to take pictures, and I feel so proud that even though so many years have passed, I think I have given around 50 years of my life to this (industry). But people still love me the same, and it doesn’t take them more than a second to recognise who I am.” \

The actor added that the fact that people are still able to recognise her is a testament to the hard work she puts in to look good. “You have to look good and presentable. Even today more men love me than women.”

भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण बोले- राजन् ! तुमने सम्पूर्ण लोकोंके हितके लिये बहुत उत्तम बात पूछी है। राजेन्द्र ! इस एकादशीका नाम 'अपरा' है। यह बहुत पुण्य प्रदान करने वाली और बड़े-बड़े पातकोंका नाश करनेवाली है। ब्रह्महत्यासे दबा हुआ, गोत्रकी हत्या करनेवाला, गर्भस्थ बालक को मारने वाला, परनिन्दक तथा परस्त्रीलम्पट पुरुष भी अपरा एकादशी के सेवन से निश्चय ही पाप रहित हो जाता है। जो झूठी गवाही देता, माप-तोलमें धोखा देता, बिना जाने ही नक्षत्रों की गणना करता और कूटनीति से आयुर्वेद का ज्ञाता बनकर वैद्य का काम करता है- ये सब नरकमें निवास करने वाले प्राणी हैं। परन्तु अपरा एकादशी के सेवनसे ये भी पापरहित हो जाते हैं। यदि व क्षत्रिय क्षात्रधर्मका परित्याग करके युद्धसे भागता है, तो वह क्षत्रियोचित धर्म से भ्रष्ट होनेके कारण घोर नरकमें पड़ता है। जो शिष्य विद्या प्राप्त करके स्वयं ही गुरुकी निन्दा करता है, वह भी महापातकों से युक्त होकर भयङ्कर नरक में गिरता है। किन्तु अपरा एकादशीके सेवनसे ऐसे मनुष्य भी सद्गतिको प्राप्त होते हैं।

माघमें जब सूर्य मकर राशिपर स्थित हों, उस समय प्रयाग में स्नान करनेवाले मनुष्यों को जो पुण्य होता है, काशी में शिवरात्रिका व्रत करनेसे जो पुण्य प्राप्त होता है, गया में पिण्डदान करके पितरों को तृप्ति प्रदान करनेवाला पुरुष जिस पुण्यका भागी होता है, बृहस्पति के सिंहराशिपर स्थित होनेपर गोदावरीमें स्रान करनेवाला मानव जिस फलको प्राप्त करता है, बदरिकाश्रमकी यात्रा के समय भगवान् केदार के दर्शन से तथा बदरीतीर्थ के सेवन से जो पुण्य फल उपलब्ध होता है तथा सूर्यग्रहण के समय कुरुक्षेत्र में दक्षिणा सहित यज्ञ करके हाथी, घोड़ा और सुवर्ण-दान करनेसे जिस फलकी प्राप्ति होती है; अपरा एकादशी के सेवनसे भी मनुष्य वैसे ही फल प्राप्त करता है। 'अपरा' को उपवास करके भगवान् वामन की पूजा करनेसे मनुष्य सब पापों से मुक्त हो श्रीविष्णुल्लेकमें प्रतिष्ठित होता है। इसको पढ़ने और सुननेसे सहस्त्र गोदान का फल मिलता है।

युधिष्ठिर ने कहा-जनार्दन। 'अपरा'का सारा माहात्य मैंने सुन लिया, अब ज्येष्ठ के शुक्ल पक्ष में जो एकादशी है उसका वर्णन कीजिये।भगवान् श्रीकृष्ण बोले- राजन्! इसका वर्णन परम धर्मात्मा सत्यवतीनन्दन व्यासजी करेंगे; क्योंकि ये सम्पूर्ण शास्त्रों के तत्त्वज्ञ और वेद-वेदाङ्गोंके पारङ्गत विद्वान् हैं।तब वेदव्यासजी कहने लगे -दोनों ही पक्षोंकी एकादशियोंको भोजन न करे । द्वादशीको स्त्रान आदि से पवित्र हो फूलों से भगवान् के शव की पूजा करके नित्य कर्म समाप्त होनेके पश्चात् पहले ब्राह्मणों को भोजन देकर अन्तमें स्वयं भोजन करे। राजन् ! जननाशौच और मरणा शौच में भी एकादशी को भोजन नहीं करना चाहिये।यह सुनकर भीम सेन बोले- परम बुद्धिमान् पितामह । मेरी उत्तम बात सुनिये । राजा युधिष्ठिर, माता न कुन्ती, द्रौपदी, अर्जुन, नकुल और सहदेव-ये एकादशीको कभी भोजन नहीं करते तथा मुझसे भी ने हमेशा यही कहते हैं कि 'भीमसेन ! तुम भी एकादशी को न खाया करो।' किन्तु मैं इन लोगों से यही कह दिया करता हूं कि 'मुझसे भूख नहीं सही जाएगी।'

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday addressed 122nd episode of his monthly radio program Mann Ki Baat. Speaking on the Operation Sindoor, PM Modi praised the Indian Army for its bravery and said that the entire nation is proud of the Army’s precise and courageous operation carried out in Pakistan.

Here are the top ten quotes from PM Modi's Mann Ki Baat: 1. Operation Sindoor Highlighting the bravery of the armed forces during Operation Sindoor, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that the operation has instilled a renewed sense of confidence and determination in the global fight against terrorism. “Operation Sindoor is not just a military mission; it is a picture of our resolve, courage and a transforming India and this picture has infused the whole country with a sense of patriotism and has painted it in the hues of the tricolour. Operation Sindoor has influenced the people of the country so much that many families have made it a part of their lives.,” PM said.

2. Vocal for local PM Modi said that our soldiers destroyed terror bases; it was their indomitable courage, along with the power of weapons, equipment and technology made in India. "After this campaign, a renewed energy is visible in the whole country regarding ‘Vocal for Local’. A parent remarked, "We will now buy toys only made in India, for our children. Patriotism will start from childhood." Some families have taken a pledge, "We will spend our next vacation in some beautiful place in the country." Many youngsters have pledged to 'Wed in India'; Someone also said, “Now every gift we give will be made by an Indian artisan,” he added.

3. ITBP team scaling Mount Makalu Narendra Modi applauded the efforts of the ITBP team for successfully scaling Mount Makalu and commended them for their environmental initiative in cleaning the area by removing over 150 kilograms of waste.

He said, “Our ITBP team went to climb the world's most difficult peak, Mount Makalu. But they didn't just climb the mountain, they also took up the task of removing the garbage lying near the peak. The members of this team brought down more than 150 kg of non-biodegradable waste with them…”

4. Sugar boards in Schools PM Modi also highlighted the introduction of ‘sugar boards’ in schools as an innovative initiative to raise awareness among children about their sugar consumption and promote healthier dietary habits.

PM said, “You must have seen blackboards in schools, but now ‘sugar boards’ are also being installed in some schools – not blackboard, but sugar board. The aim of this unique initiative of CBSE is to make children aware of their sugar intake. By understanding how much sugar should be consumed and how much sugar is being consumed, children have started choosing healthy options themselves. This is a unique effort and its impact will also be very positive.”

5. Khelo India Speaking on the recent success of Khelo India, PM Modi remarked that five cities in Bihar had the honour of hosting the events, where matches across various categories were organised. He said, “In the Weight Lifting competitions, the brilliant performances of Asmita Dhone of Maharashtra, Harshvardhan Sahu of Odisha and Tushar Chaudhary of Uttar Pradesh won everyone's heart. Sairaj Pardesi of Maharashtra went on to create three records. In athletics, Qadir Khan and Sheikh Zeeshan of Uttar Pradesh and Hansraj of Rajasthan performed brilliantly.”

6. MoU with WHO Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared in the 122nd episode of Mann Ki Baat, “Along with 'Yoga Day', there has been a significant development in the field of Ayurveda. On May 24, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in the presence of WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, whom I fondly call Tulsi Bhai.” He added, “ Along with this agreement, work has started on a dedicated traditional medicine module under the International Classification of Health Interventions. This initiative will help in making AYUSH reach a maximum number of people across the world scientifically...”

7. ‘Drone didi bringing revolution in agriculture,’ says PM Modi highlighted the growing role of women in agriculture and technology, saying, “Women in villages are now flying drones as ‘Drone Didis’, bringing about a new revolution in agriculture.”

He cited the example of the Sangareddy district of Telangana where women are completing the work of spraying pesticides on 50 acres of land with the help of drones. “Three hours in the morning, two hours in the evening and the work is done. Neither the scorching sun, nor the danger of poisonous chemicals. The villagers have also accepted this change wholeheartedly. Now these women are not known as 'drone operators' but as ‘sky warriors’,” said the PM.

8. PM Modi said in his address that on account of the collective fight against Maoism, basic facilities have started reaching Maoist violence-affected areas as well. “People of Katejhari village of the Gadchiroli district in Maharashtra had been waiting for this day for years. A bus could never run here before. Why? It’s because this village was affected by Maoist violence. And when the bus reached the village for the first time, people welcomed it by playing the Dhol-Nagara,” PM said.

Operation Sindoor is not just a military mission; it is a picture of our resolve, courage and a transforming India.

PM Modi also highlighted educational progress in areas once affected by Naxalism, particularly in Chhattisgarh's Dantewada district, where students have excelled despite the challenges. Students from the district achieved impressive results in the 10th and 12th board examinations, with around a 95 per cent pass rate; Dantewada topped the 10th-grade results and secured the sixth position in the 12th-grade exams in Chhattisgarh.

New Delhi: Government wheat procurement for the 2025-26 rabi marketing season (April–June) has crossed 29.7 million tonnes (MT) as of 22 May, the highest since the 2021-22 season, according to official data. Brisk purchases amid a bumper harvest is expected to ensure sufficient stocks for distribution through the public distribution system (PDS) and enable market intervention to curb price spikes.

Procurement stood at 26.6 MT in 2024–25, 26.2 MT in 2023–24, and just 18.8 MT in 2022–23.

Data from the Food Corp. of India (FCI) show that wheat procurement this year is up 13.5% from the same period last year, with purchases nearing completion in most major producing states.

Wheat production is projected at a record 115.43 MT for the 2024-25 rabi season, up 2% from 113.29 MT last year, according to the agriculture ministry. The increase is largely due to favourable weather and the absence of major crop damage from natural calamities.

Punjab leads with 11.9 MT procured by government agencies, according to a senior official in the state’s Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department. Private traders in Punjab bought another 1.0 MT, of the total arrivals in the state of around 13 MT.

Madhya Pradesh and Haryana follow with 7.77 MT and 7.14 MT, respectively. Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have recorded procurement of 1.83 MT and 1.0 MT.

Procurement from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan has seen a significant jump this year, driven by state-level incentives. Madhya Pradesh offered a bonus of ₹175 per quintal over the minimum support price (MSP) of ₹2,425, while Rajasthan announced a ₹150 bonus. Last year, Madhya Pradesh procured 4.8 MT and Rajasthan 1.2 MT.

Anticipating a strong harvest, the central government had set a procurement target of 31.2 MT for this season, including targets of 12.4 MT from Punjab, 7.5 MT from Haryana, 6 MT from Madhya Pradesh, 3 MT from Uttar Pradesh, and 2 MT from Rajasthan. However, Union Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi recently indicated that actual procurement could touch 32–32.5 MT.

Reliance ADAG group stocks in focus: Shares of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG), which include Reliance Home Finance, Reliance Infrastructure, and Reliance Power, saw a significant increase during trading on Friday (May 23). The stocks of Anil Ambani's Reliance ADAG group experienced a surge, fueled by a number of positive announcements, enhanced financial stability, and important new business initiatives.

Reliance Home Finance shares saw a rise of 10% to ₹3.64 each, Reliance Power stock increased by 19% to ₹53, and Reliance Infrastructure's share price rose by 10.5% to ₹313 per share.

Gaurav Goel, the Founder & Director at Fynocrat Technologies, notes that the current stock surge is primarily driven by two major companies from the Anil Ambani-led Reliance ADAG group: Reliance Power, a notable private-sector electricity producer that is also making strides in solar and renewable energy with various large-scale projects.

The second company, Reliance Infrastructure, focuses on power distribution and EPC contracts while becoming increasingly involved in defense manufacturing through its subsidiary, Reliance Defence.

Although both firms faced challenges in the past due to significant debt and poor performance, a number of crucial agreements and improved financial outcomes are altering investor sentiment towards these companies.

Gaurav Goel explains five crucial factors that are fueling investor confidence 1. Big Moves in Renewable Energy Reliance Power is repositioning itself as a major renewable energy player. Recent project wins include:

- SECI PPA : Subsidiary Reliance NU Suntech signed a 25-year agreement with SECI to supply 930 MW of solar power with 1,860 MWh of battery storage. This ₹10,000 crore project is set to become Asia’s largest integrated solar plus storage plant.

- SJVN Win : Reliance NU Energies won a national tender for a 350 MW solar + 700 MWh BESS project floated by SJVN, further strengthening the group’s clean energy footprint.

- Bhutan Project : Reliance Power also signed a commercial term sheet with Bhutan’s government to develop a 500 MW solar plant in a ₹2,000 crore joint venture which is the largest private-sector foreign investment in Bhutan’s renewable space to date.

2. Stronger Financial position Reliance Power recently reported a turnaround , posting a net profit of ₹126 crore for the March quarter, compared to a loss of ₹397 crore in the same period last year. The cost controls and lower finance expenses are being seen as a sign of operational discipline.

3. Fresh Capital Inflow In May, Reliance Power raised ₹392 crore through the conversion of preferential warrants by Reliance Infrastructure and Basera Home Finance. This capital boost helps strengthen the balance sheet and improve financial flexibility.

4. Strategic Defence Partnership Reliance Infrastructure’s defence arm, Reliance Defence Ltd, announced a strategic collaboration with Rheinmetall AG, a major German defence company. After two successful joint ventures with global majors, Dassault Aviation and Thales Group of France, this is the third significant international partnership for Reliance Defence.A non-binding agreement has been signed to jointly manufacture ammunition and propellants in India.

A large-scale Greenfield manufacturing facility will be built in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, under the Dhirubhai Ambani Defence City. The goal is to position Reliance Defence among the top three defence exporters in India. The manufacturing facility, one of the largest in South Asia, will have an annual capacity to produce up to 200,000 artillery shells, 10,000 tons of explosives and 2,000 tons of propellants.

5. Debt Resolution Reliance Infrastructure also announced a settlement of a ₹1,673 crore corporate guarantee with Cosmea Business Acquisitions Pvt Ltd. The agreement gives the company 10 years of flexibility, with no immediate cash obligations.

On a less positive note, HK Toll Road, a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure, is involved in a legal matter where Canara Bank has filed a case for a claim of ₹282.60 crore under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The company has assured that it will take the necessary legal steps to protect its interests.

Technical View According to Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments, the ADAG pack, Reliance Power stands out as the strongest, having broken out of a 33-week-long cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart. The breakout was backed by volumes 8x higher than the 50-day average, indicating strong, broad-based participation.

“The stock is currently holding above the breakout level, and any dip towards ₹48 or consolidation around this zone presents a fresh buying opportunity. The pattern projects an immediate upside target of ₹65,” said Jain.

Gold, silver prices in your city, May 25: Experts are eyeing a “bullish” outlook for the yellow metal as uncertainity over Donald Trump's tariff wars on China and the European Union (EU) fuelled gold prices last week.

Gold and silver are safe haven investments, which experts feel insulate your portfolio against the volatile equities market. Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities feels that gold prices are upwards bound in June. He believes the markets will closely track US economic data, Q1 GDP and consumer confidence numbers in the near term.

Overall, gold rates have surged 30 per cent year-on-year (YoY), and it has given 15 per cent CAGR returns since 2001, as an investment. It has also beaten inflation by more than 2-4 per cent since 1995, as per data.

For silver, Colin Shah, MD of Kama Jewelry believes prices “may remain relatively stable, unless any major economic development takes precedence”. This year, silver has proved a stabler bet than gold.

Commodiy experts feel that buying gold on dips is an “opportunity” and some recommend gold ETFs to create exposure while saving on making charges and storage cost. However, please check your own financial goals and requirements, and cosnult with your financial manager (if one), for how to add commodities to your portfolio mix.

US President Donald Trump took to the social media platform TRUTH on Sunday to defend his administration's move to block the prestigious university from enrolling international students.

Trump asked, "Why isn’t Harvard saying that almost 31% of their students are from FOREIGN LANDS, and yet those countries, some not at all friendly to the United States, pay NOTHING toward their student’s education, nor do they ever intend to. Nobody told us that!"

Trump said his administration's request to demand specific details about “violent activities by non-immigrant students” from Harvard is "reasonable".

He said, "We want to know who those foreign students are, a reasonable request since we give Harvard BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, but Harvard isn’t exactly forthcoming."

"We want those names and countries. Harvard has $52,000,000, use it, and stop asking for the Federal Government to continue GRANTING money to you!," Trump said.

US bans Harvard University from enrolling foreign students US' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students and the lucrative income stream they provide into doubt.

A federal judge has placed a temporary hold on the Harvard ban.

Earlier, Noem had demanded Harvard submit records of any violent or illegal activity by foreign students by April 30 or immediately lose [the Student and Exchange Visitor Program] certification under the federal government’s student visa program.

"Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing. It refused. They have lost their Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification as a result of their failure to adhere to the law," Noem added.

The White House is cracking down on US universities on several fronts, justified as a reaction to what the administration says is uncontrolled anti-Semitism and a need to reverse diversity programs aimed at addressing historical oppression of minorities.

It has also moved to revoke visas and deport foreign students involved in protests against the war in Gaza, accusing them of supporting Palestinian militant group Hamas, news agency AFP reported.

At Harvard, the government has threatened to put $9 billion of funding under review, then went on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2 billion of grants and $60 million of official contracts.

It has also targeted a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation.

The loss of foreign nationals — more than a quarter of its student body — could prove costly to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition.

New Delhi: The private sector has overtaken the public sector in India’s seed production, driven by its dominance in high-value crops such as cotton and horticulture.

In 2023–24, private firms accounted for 71% of the country’s seed production, up from 40% in 2009-10, according to data from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). In contrast, the share of state-run seed producers fell from 60% to just 29% over the same period.

This shift has implications for Indian agriculture, which relies on both public institutions like ICAR and market-driven innovation to improve yields, ensure food security, and support smallholder farmers. The divergence also reflects the differing priorities of public and private players: while public firms focus on low-value, high-volume crops such as cereals, pulses, and oilseeds, private companies have cornered the market in high-margin segments with greater commercial potential.

“Public sector seed companies in India are losing market share because they are outpaced by private firms, especially in producing high-value seeds for horticulture crops and cotton where seed replacement is high," said a senior executive at a state-run seed company. “In staples like cereals and pulses, seed replacement is low, around 30-40%, as farmers often preserve their own seeds. Also, the value (of such seeds) is low."

Public institutions like ICAR have historically focused on staple crops such as cereals, pulses, and oilseeds--vital for food security--while private firms have targeted high-margin, hybrid-based systems for crops like cotton and horticulture. As private companies expand their footprint, they are also playing a growing role in innovation, often tailoring products to market demands through field-level insights, according to industry experts.

“Private sector firms understand the farmer’s needs and work in coordination with them, ensuring timely availability of seeds," said Vaibhav Ravi Kashikar, executive director at Ankur Seeds Pvt. Ltd. “They also have robust quality control systems to ensure better seed quality."

According to the Federation of Seed Industry of India (FSII), around 800 private seed companies operate in India, including multinationals. Nearly 100 of them run in-house R&D programmes. Many have also licensed seed varieties developed by ICAR for key crops such as wheat, rice, maize, and mustard, highlighting a degree of public-private collaboration.

Even so, farmer groups and civil society organizations have voiced concerns about private-sector dominance, particularly around affordability, access, and farmer dependence.

Ram Kaundinya, advisor to FSII, dismisses such concerns. “Successful economies around the world are driven by private-sector seed markets. There’s a misconception that private firms exploit farmers, but no company can afford to exploit its own customers and expect to survive," he said. “As per Ministry of Agriculture data, seeds account for only 5% of a farmer’s total production cost, including for crops like cotton. Concerns about seed pricing are largely misplaced."

Kaundinya also pointed out that India’s seed market is segmented by price and crop, with companies targeting different farmer profiles. “Seeds can’t be priced beyond reach, otherwise, there’s no market," he said.

Farmer sentiment reflects this diversity.

Ramneek Singh, a grower from Abohar in Punjab, said, “For food grains like paddy and wheat, I usually go with government seeds. But for Bt cotton or horticulture, I choose private companies. It depends on the crop and what’s available in my area."

The Indian seed industry is valued at $6.3 billion ( ₹54,158 crore) and expected to grow to $12.7 billion by 2028 and $20 billion by 2040, according to FSII. With rising demand for food and growing focus on climate resilience, both public and private players are expected to play a role, but with very different strategies.

“The private sector is working closely with farmers, constantly upgrading R&D and developing varieties tailored to changing weather patterns," said Sameer Mulay, managing director at Ajeet Seeds Pvt. Ltd. “Gene-edited crops could be the next big shift."

Industry bodies, meanwhile, have been pushing for policy support to help the sector expand beyond domestic borders. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), in a recent proposal, urged the government to introduce a Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the seed industry, along with a Research-Linked Incentive scheme.

India currently accounts for just 1% of the global seed export market. With the right policies, CII estimates the country could capture up to 10% of the $14-billion global seed trade, worth around ₹10,000 crore, by 2028.

Towards the end of the ancient Indian epic, the Mahabharata, Krishna’s Yadava clan self-destructs. Many dark omens presage their downfall: nature behaves erratically and pests multiply. Sin, deception and violence proliferate, eroding trust and solidarity. Clan members humiliate and insult elders. When Krishna’s extended family goes on a picnic, the men get drunk, argue and attack each other, until eventually all of them are dead.

This cautionary tale has gained new resonance as geopolitical tensions—including in South Asia—escalate and many countries embrace protectionist policies. US President Donald Trump’s second administration has contributed significantly to the current fragmentation and disorder. But other wealthy countries have exacerbated the situation by failing to show any real solidarity in response to Trump’s hostile policies.

The lack of development cooperation is a prime example of this growing appetite for mutually assured destruction. To be sure, aid from donor countries was already declining. The covid pandemic exposed the system’s injustices and highlighted Western governments’ greed, undermining trust in their global leadership. Moreover, these governments have directed most of their dwindling foreign-aid budgets to Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion, diverting funds away from other war-torn and desperately poor countries, underscoring the largely self-serving approach to such ‘charity’ flows.

Still, it is surprising and dispiriting that other donor countries have not stepped up after Trump terminated almost all US foreign-aid funding and programming. This would have been the obvious thing to do, not necessarily out of solidarity, but simply because of geopolitical self-interest.

For starters, Trump’s indiscriminate attacks on allies and rivals alike have demonstrated the necessity of coordinated action—building alliances, supporting multilateralism and cultivating soft power. One easy and relatively cheap way to do that is continuing to support multilateral institutions. Such funding may also defuse some of the anger that many in the Global South feel about Western complicity in the ongoing mass killings in Gaza.

Moreover, the massive reduction in US direct aid and financing for international organizations will hinder the provision of global public goods, including healthcare and climate stability. The concept of global public investment suggests that all countries have a stake in solving these challenges and should thus contribute resources to address them, according to their means, and distribute the collected funds based on need and impact.

But the response of most rich countries has been appalling so far. Instead of scaling up foreign assistance, several European governments have slashed it, citing the need to channel funds to defence investment. As a result, some of the most immediate needs that fall under a global public investment framework are going unmet.

This is especially baffling because the amounts required to plug the development-financing hole left by the US are so small as to be trivial.

For example, Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the World Health Organization—which remains absolutely critical for managing global health threats—means that the WHO faces a $1.9 billion budget shortfall in 2026-27—a gap that rich countries and even most large middle-income countries could easily afford to fill.

It’s a similar story at other international organizations. The United Nations World Food Programme now faces an estimated 40% reduction in funding—equal to roughly $4 billion. The WFP, which served more than 100 million people in 2024 and won the Nobel Peace Prize five years ago, must now downsize its staff by nearly one-third (around 6,000 positions worldwide) and reduce the amount of life- saving food that it provides, because no other countries have offered to offset the shortfall.

Similarly, the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), which relied on the US for more than 40% of its financing, will need to cut more than half of its workforce and reduce or eliminate some of its essential programmes.

Switzerland and the United Kingdom, two other major UNAIDS funders, have likewise reduced their contributions. That could lead to six times more HIV infections and a 400% increase in AIDS deaths by 2029, as well as the emergence of new strains, which would have negative repercussions for all countries. But the organization’s budget gap is a modest $58 million—the same shortfall facing the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which has to lay off a fifth of its staff.

Given these minuscule sums, filling the gap left by the US would have a negligible fiscal impact on traditional donors and large middle-income countries. But only a handful of countries, like South Korea, have responded to the funding crisis, preventing essential organizations’ collapse and enabling them to function properly—for now.

The real Rosesh from Sarabhai vs Sarabhai, Rajesh Kumar, just dropped the most "iconic" video of the year -- a recreation of “Rosesh of Pakistan” Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's viral speech.

Bilawal Bhutto's speech in Pakistan’s Parliament went viral, more because of HOW he said it and less because of what he said, making him an inspiration for millions of memes online.

The speech, given after India’s Operation Sindoor targeting terror sites in PoK and Pakistan, reminded many of Rosesh’s dramatic style. Social media users joked about the resemblance.

Since many online users compared the Pakistan leader to Rosesh, his oddball character from the sitcom Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai, Rajesh said that the video was made “on public demand”.

Rajesh's Instagram video went viral in less than and has amassed over 1.3 million views so far. He posted the viral video alongside the caption: “ON PUBLIC DEMAND…..welcome Hon Rosesh of Pakistan.”

Here's how netizens reacted: Netizens were left in stitches as Rajesh donned his ‘Roshesh’ hat for this “hilarious” video. Social media users chanted “Bharat momma ki jai!” in the Roshesh way in the comment section.

“Wow! This is going to be the greatest reel of all time!” a user said.

A netizen joked that Rajesh should file a copyright claim on Bhutto. “Uspe copyright claim dal do bhai.”

“This is hilarious,” a user said.

Another added that the video was the best thing on the Internet for the day. “I wasn't ready for this drop! Scrolling ends here. Nothing’s topping this today!”

Who is Bilawal Bhutto? What did he say? Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the son of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and President Asif Ali Zardari. The grandson of former Pakistan President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto also served as Pakistan’s Minister of Foreign Affairs.

He has been at his jingoistic best since the Pahalgam terror attack, which killed at least 26 people.

The Liberian cargo ship, which capsizced off the coast of Kerala on May 24, has sunk today, according to agency reports. The vessel had 24 crew onboard — all of whom were rescued by the Indian Coast Guard (ICG), it added.

Concerns have now shifted to the environmental front as the ship was also carrying 640 containers — including 13 with harardous cargo and 12 with calcium carbide, according to a PTI report.

“In the early hours of 25 May, MSC ELSA 3 listed rapidly and capsized at position 09°18.76'N 076°08.12'E and sank,” a statement from the ICG on May 25 said. It said the three remaining crew abandoned the sinking vessel and were rescued by INS Sujata, which joined operations last evening.

Environment, pollution concerns grow: Teams on alert The ICG said the ship Saksham, equipped with pollution response equipment, has been positioned at the scene to respond to any oil spill scenario.

Of the 640 containers onboard, 13 contained hazardous cargo, while 12 containers with calcium carbide were present, it said.

“The ship had in its tanks 84.44 MT of diesel and 367.1 MT of furnace oil,” the ICG said.

Noting that the sensitive coast of Kerala is home to both vivid biodiversity and is a major tourist attraction, it further said the ICG has geared up pollution response preparedness and coordination with the state administration for all possible scenarios.

“ICG aircraft with advanced oil spill mapping technology are undertaking an assessment of the situation. Presently, no oil spill has been reported,” it added.

The Indian Coast Guard also said it is fully geared to respond to the emerging scenario and is closely monitoring the environmental impact in the aftermath of the sinking of MSC ELSA 3.

The development comes amid intense efforts by the Indian Navy and the Coast Guard, which were exploring methods to assist in towing the vessel.

The Liberian container ship, carrying marine fuel, listed several degrees about 38 nautical miles off the Kerala coast on Saturday, causing its cargo to spill into the sea.

A Defence PRO said another vessel from the parent company had reached the area as part of the assistance efforts.

Earlier, authorities had stated that out of the 24 crew members on board, 21 were rescued, while three remained onboard as per instructions from the company.

He added that the Coast Guard, which spearheaded the rescue operation, and Indian Navy ships are maintaining their positions in the area and monitoring the situation.

The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has cautioned the general public against touching any cargo containers or oil spills that may wash ashore.

They have also urged people to immediately inform the police if they spot any containers or oil on the shore. The 184-metre-long vessel, MSC ELSA 3, departed for Kochi from Vizhinjam port on Friday.

At around 1.25 p.m. on May 24, the company owning the ship informed Indian authorities that it was listing by 26 degrees and sought urgent assistance.

The Coast Guard was coordinating rescue operations by maintaining ships and aircraft near the distressed vessel.

The vessel's 24-member crew comprises one Russian (the Master), 20 Filipinos, two Ukrainians, and one Georgian national.

According to the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, there is a possibility that cargo --including containers and oil-- may wash ashore. KSDMA also warned that oil films could appear along parts of the coast.

The Coast Guard has confirmed that the vessel was carrying Marine Gas Oil (MGO) and Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO).

A new study has found that dog owners who come home moaning about a tough day at work may be making their pets stressed and unhappy. Researchers in the US discovered that dogs show more signs of stress-related behaviour when they are exposed to their owners’ workplace worries. The study suggests that owners should avoid bringing home their work problems to “protect the well-being of man’s best friend," Daily Mail reported.

Work stress is a common issue in the UK, affecting around 700,000 people each year and causing an estimated 16 million lost working days, the report further added. The team of psychologists from Radford University in Virginia wanted to see if family dogs could also be affected by their owners’ stress.

They asked 85 adults who owned dogs to observe their pets on days when they came home feeling stressed, as well as on less stressful days or days off. Owners were asked to watch for signs that their dogs were unhappy, such as excessive whimpering or a poor appetite.

The results, published in the journal Scientific Reports, showed dogs clearly became more stressed on days when owners complained about problems at work. Even just thinking about stressful work issues seemed to affect the dogs’ moods.

The researchers said: “Dogs are highly sensitive animals who can ‘catch’ the emotions and feelings of humans. They experience increases in stress when their owner does. Given most people view their pets as family, protecting them against stress may encourage them to resist engaging in ruminative thoughts about work.”

Previous studies have shown dogs become upset when they hear their owners cry. The team also noted that dogs’ advanced sense of smell might help them detect rising levels of cortisol, a hormone released when the body is stressed.

Ashoka University professor Ali Khan Mahmudabad has moved Supreme Court challenging his arrest for social media posts related to Operation Sindoor. Mahmudabad was arrested on Sunday over his Facebook posts about press briefings after Operation Sindoor.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal mentioned the matter before a bench headed by Chief Justice BR Gavai for early hearing of the case. The Supreme Court said matter will be listed for hearing on May 20 or 21, news agency ANI reported.

Ali, who teaches Political Science at Haryana-based Ashoka University, was arrested b yHaryana police from his Delhi residence on 18 May and sent to a two-day remand based on acomplaint filed by Yogesh Jatheri,the general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Yuva Morcha in Haryana. The complaint was filed on 17 May.

Ali, 42, was arrested under sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) that deal with desition and insulting religious beliefs, family sources said. One of the charges against him is Section 152 of the BNS, which replaced the sedition law in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and criminalises acts that endanger the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India.

Kapil Balyan, one of Ali's lawyers, told news agency PTI that he was produced before a court on Sunday evening and remanded in police custody for two days in a case.

Who is Ali Khan Mahmudabad? Ali Khan Mahmudabad a historian, political scientist, writer, poet and a faculty at Ashoka University, Sonipat, Haryana.

Ali is the son of Mohammad Amir Mohammad Khan, popularly known as Raja Sahab Mahmudabad, who spent about forty in a legal battle to reclaim his ancestral property seized by the government under the Enemy Properties Act.Raja Saheb passed away in October 2023.

Ali's father was the only son of Mohammad Amir Ahmad Khan, the last ruling Raja of Mahmudabad and long-time treasurer and major financier of the Muslim League before partition of India.

Ali's mother, Rani Vijay is the daughter of Padma Bhushan Jagat Singh Mehta, who served as India’s Foreign Secretary from 1976-79, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the External Affairs Minister.

Arrested for a "thoughtful" Facebook post: Congress Congress party has slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the centre over the arrest. In a post on X, Khera said Mahmudabad has been arrested for a "thoughtful" Facebook post.

“A historian and academic is jailed not for inciting violence but for advocating against it. His crime? Daring to speak truth to power, exposing the BJP's cynical communal narrative, and calling out the hypocrisy of chest-thumping nationalism.”

Ashoka University confirmed Ali's arrest and said it will continue to cooperate with Police.

“We have been made aware that Prof Ali Khan Mahmudabad has been taken into police custody earlier today. We are in the process of ascertaining details of the case. The University will continue to cooperate with the Police and local authorities in the investigation, fully," the university said in a statement on Sunday.

Trinamool MP and former cricketer Yusuf Pathan will not join the Centre’s Operation Sindoor outreach programme. It aims to send a multi-party delegation to over 30 countries to highlight India's stand on terrorism.

Trinamool Congress said neither Pathan nor any other TMC MP would be a part of the delegations, and claimed that the Baharampur MP's name was included without consulting the party.

‘Mother party will decide’ Bengal Chief Minister and party supremo Mamata Banerjee issued an official clarification saying that no request came to the “mother party” for names for the delegation.

“They cannot decide member's name on their own. It is not their choice, the party [Trinamool] will decide. If they request the mother party will decide as is customary,” she said, adding that the party is“totally with the Central government on external affairs policies.”

‘How can the BJP decide?’ Objecting to the Centre's choice of MP to represent the Trinamool Congress, the party's National General Secretary Abhishek Banerjee said, “How can the Union Government decide on the representative of Trinamool?”

Banerjee said the government should have held discussions with the opposition to decide which representative a party will send. “How can the BJP decide which representative Trinamool will send?”

‘Foreign policy is a Union govt domain’ News agency ANI cited TMC sources as saying that the Union government should solely be responsible for the nation's foreign policy, and not the Opposition.

“Foreign policy is entirely within the domain of the Union government. Therefore, let only the Union government decide our foreign policy and take complete responsibility for it,” TMC sources said.

It added that the party believes that the nation is above all and has pledged their support to the Union government to take whatever action is needed to protect our great country. “Our Armed Forces have made our nation proud and we are forever indebted to them.”

About the Operation Sindoor outreach programme The multi-party delegation, consisting of seven groups led by one MP each, has been initiated by the Indian government to counter global misinformation and highlight India's zero-tolerance policy on terrorism in over 30 countries.

The mission operates under the theme "One Mission, One Message, One Bharat," with a unified goal of presenting India's response to terrorism in the wake of Operation Sindoor.

The seven delegations will visit Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Algeria, the UK, France, Germany, the EU, Italy, Denmark, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea, Japan, Singapore, the UAE, Liberia, Congo, Sierra Leone, the USA, Panama, Guyana, Brazil, Colombia, Spain, Greece, Slovenia, Latvia, Russia, Egypt, Qatar, Ethiopia, and South Africa.

In a joint operation, the Andhra Pradesh Police and their Telangana counterparts arrested two men suspected of plotting bomb blasts in Hyderabad.

One of the suspects, Siraj Ur Rehman (29) from Vizianagaram, was taken into custody following a tip-off. During a search of his premises, authorities seized explosives, including ammonia, sulphur, and aluminium powder, police reported on Sunday, PTI reported.

“In the course of the investigation, Rehman revealed details leading to the detention of another individual, Syed Sameer (28), from Hyderabad,” police added.

Both accused are in custody and will be produced before a court, police said, urging public cooperation and vigilance.

This development follows India's remarkable success in Operation Sindoor, where precision airstrikes reportedly eliminated nearly 100 terror operatives at major bases in Pakistan.

In the course of the investigation, Rehman revealed details leading to the detention of another individual.

Operation Sindoor was India's decisive military response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. Launched on May 7, Operation Sindoor led to the death of over 100 terrorists affiliated with terror outfits like the Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen.

After the attack, Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling across the Line of Control and Jammu and Kashmir as well as attempted drone attacks along the border regions, following which India launched a coordinated attack and damaged radar infrastructure, communication centres, and airfields across 11 airbases in Pakistan.

After this, on May 10, India and Pakistan reached an agreement to stop all firing and military action on land, air and sea.

Meanwhile, in Operation Sindoor, Air Defence systems played a key role like the AKASH missile system and L-70 Air Defence Guns successfully thwarted Pakistani missile and drone threats.

During heightened tensions with Pakistan, India’s Air Defence network effectively intercepted multiple threats—including drones, missiles, micro UAVs, and loitering munitions—cementing its reputation as a world-class, operationally ready defence asset.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has arrested former UCO Bank CMD Subodh Kumar Goel, from his residence in New Delhi in connection with a probe against Concast Steel & Power Ltd. (CSPL) and others in an alleged bank fraud case.

He was brought before the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Kolkata on May 17, and has been sent him to ED custody till May 21, the agency said in a statement.

Allegations againt UCO Bank ex-CMD Goel was arrested from his Delhi residence on May 16, for alleged money laundering. This is in relation to an alleged bank loan fraud case of over ₹6,200 crore linked to a Kolkata-based company, according to a PTI report.

Premises linked to Goel and some other were raided by the ED in April, as part of this investigation, the PTI report added.

The charges comes from an FIR from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) related to the sanction of credit facilities to CSPL and subsequent large-scale “diversion” and “siphoning” of loans amounting to ₹6,210.72 crore (principle amount without interest).

The ED claimed that during the tenure of Goel as the CMD of UCO Bank, large credit facilities were “sanctioned” to CSPL which were subsequently "diverted" and "siphoned off" by the borrower group; and in turn, Goel allegedly received “substantial illegal gratification” from CSPL.

“The illegal gratification was layered and channelled through various entities to give a facade of legitimacy. Investigation revealed that Goel received cash, immovable properties, luxury goods, hotel booking etc routed through a web of shell companies, dummy persons and through family members to conceal the criminal origin of the money,” the ED said.

Goel or his lawyer could not be contacted for a response on the allegations made by the ED against him.

Properties acquired through shell companies identified As per the ED statement, several properties acquired through shell or dummy companies — “beneficially owned or controlled” by Goel and his family members — have been identified.

“The source of funds of these entities is linked to CSPL. Evidence gathered so far also shows use of accommodation entries and structured layering through front companies for systematic settlement of kickbacks,” the ED said.

Case Background Notably, in December 2024, the ED arrested Sanjay Sureka, the main promoter of CSPL. A chargesheet was also filed before the Kolkata court in February 2025, the PTI report added.

The agency had attached assets worth ₹510 crore of Sureka and CSPL as part of two orders issued under the PMLA.

Military clothing, accessories and gadgets have time and again informed both menswear and womenswear. So much so that these army-inspired items—practical, durable and utilitarian—have become an integral part of our daily wardrobe over the years.

The ubiquitous trench coat, for instance. It was crafted for the soldiers of World War I by Thomas Burberry, the English fashion designer and the founder of the brand Burberry. This tough looking yet chic piece features a double-breasted closure with 10 front buttons, a storm flap, wide lapels, and pockets that button-close. Over the years, designers like Christopher Bailey and Riccardo Tisci have reimagined the coat, adding prints and embroideries.

The fatigue jacket is another example. Its origin can be traced to the basic uniform for British troops during World War II. This dust-hued khaki jacket with four pockets—two on the hips, two on the breasts—and all buttoned, has been recontextualised in textiles like leather and suede. Also, worth mentioning is the parka, another military offshoot, which usually comes with a furry hood and a zipper closure. Crafted in lightweight waterproof nylon and cotton construction, this utilitarian piece is said to have kept the US troops warm during the Korean war without obstructing movement.

Here are some other noteworthy derivatives from military apparels that have refined and redefined menswear clothing and accessories, and the story behind their origin.

Computex 2025 is a wrap. The four-day Taipei event at the Nangang Exhibition Halls saw 86,521 visitors from 152 countries. This year’s event was themed “AI Next". It highlighted AI advancements, next-gen tech, future mobility and lots of robotics.

From Acer’s AI-powered wearables to ASUS HealthAI Genie and Intel’s New Arc Pro GPUs, here’s a roundup of all that AI goodness from the show floor.

Acer’s AI-powered wearables

There were not one but two products from Acer's house. The first of them is the AI TransBuds. These are truly wireless stereo (TWS) earphones with an ear-hook design. They come in a black colourway. Their USP is that they support AI-backed live translations in 15 major languages, covering languages spoken across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. These buds are lightweight and compact, and they support Bluetooth 5.4.

The company says these are "ideal for casual conversations, business meetings, livestreams, or online study sessions". The languages supported include Chinese, English, Filipino, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, and Vietnamese.

It is a visual that will stay with me for a long time: An abandoned music store, overgrown with plants and weeds, in the middle of a once beautiful and now ruined city; and at the centre of the scene, a pristine acoustic guitar leaning against a box, glowing with an almost ethereal light. A reminder of all that was once lovely and is now lost in this world reeling from a cruel apocalypse, but also, a symbol of hope and possibility. The Last of Us is that unusual zombie show that forces us to look deeper not just at the potential for cruelty in all of us—a lot of post-apocalyptic shows do that—but at the potential for beauty and love at the same time.

In this scene, 19-year-old Ellie (played by Bella Ramsey) finds a guitar that has survived the end of the world as we know it in a music store in Seattle, or what was once Seattle, and starts idly strumming it. Eventually, she settles on a song she learnt from her foster father—a-ha’s 1984 hit Take on Me. In her version, the original’s synth-pop briskness has been stripped away, leaving behind the lovely bones of the song: a soothing melody, a plea for love, a playful serenade.

I was familiar with the original Take on Me, of course, given that about 90% of my Spotify library is 1980s music. I had even heard the band’s own acoustic version of the song. But this mellow, almost unbearably sweet rendition of it, weighted with meaning and context, has become an obsession in the weeks since this episode aired. I’m sure it’s a fairly common experience, though always a special one, for a song that one has known—and even tepidly liked—to suddenly become extraordinary.

Every month, Mint’s Plain Facts section brings out an update on key global data to thread together the biggest developments in the world that are worth paying attention to. The accompanying analysis and charts explain how each story is creating ripples on the global stage, where it is headed in the coming weeks, and whether it can impact India.

Policy outlook

In the coming month, several major central banks are poised to announce monetary policy decisions, with many facing a delicate balancing act—managing persistent inflationary pressures while navigating the uncertainties of US tariff policies.

The US Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan are widely expected to keep interest rates steady. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and European Central Bank (ECB) may consider rate cuts to stimulate growth amid stable inflation.

Read this | RBI’s double-barreled liquidity surge in May to force down lending rates

The US Federal Reserve is expected to hold rates steady as it weighs the potential economic fallout from the tariffs against the inflationary risks. The Bank of England, having eased rates in May to address growth concerns and softening inflation, may hold steady now but could resume easing by August. The Bank of Japan is likely to pause in June to assess tariff-related uncertainties but may begin rate hikes later as inflation pressures build.

Trade truce

After exchanging steep reciprocal tariffs, the US and China agreed to a 90-day pause in their tariff war, including reduced tariffs during this period. The truce, reached following high-level talks in Switzerland, marks a significant de-escalation after US tariffs on Chinese imports peaked at 145% and China’s tariffs on US goods reached 125%.

Currently, US tariffs on Chinese products average around 30%, while China’s tariffs on US goods stand near 10%. Prior to the agreement, China experienced a sharp drop in exports to the US in April, alongside a notable rise in shipments to ASEAN countries, suggesting efforts to sidestep US tariffs.

While the terms of any final deal remain uncertain, this temporary truce has eased global tensions, with brokerages lowering the likelihood of a US recession.

Post-Brexit pact

Five years after formally leaving the European Union, the UK and the EU have unveiled their first major post-Brexit deal, signalling a strategic reset in their complex relationship.

Unveiled at a London summit led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the agreement covers trade, defence, energy, migration, and youth mobility, aiming to improve cooperation and ease tensions. The trade relationship between the UK and the EU has undergone significant shifts since Brexit. While the EU remains a key trading partner, accounting for around 41% of UK exports and 51% of imports in 2024, the UK has diversified its trade portfolio, with non-EU countries now receiving 59% of its exports.

Nonetheless, UK exports to both the EU and non-EU markets have declined sharply since Brexit, underscoring the urgency of securing trade agreements with the EU and other partners like India.

Read this | With India-UK FTA talks concluded, India to introduce global tendering for public procurement

However, since Brexit, the UK's exports to both the EU and non-EU have declined sharply, pressing the need to strike trade deals with the EU and other countries like India.

Bond rout

The global bond market is facing a sharp sell-off, driven by a wave of fiscal concerns and a loss of confidence in long-term government debt.

Moody’s downgrade of the US credit outlook and renewed fears over soaring deficits—fuelled by Donald Trump’s tax plans—have triggered a broad-based reassessment of risk. Investors are not only exiting the US Treasuries but also long-duration bonds in major economies like Japan and Germany.

Yields on 30-year US bonds surged past 5% recently, while Japanese and German yields have also jumped. Structural shifts, such as reduced demand from Japanese insurers and looser fiscal policy in Europe, are compounding the pressure.

Investors now favour shorter-duration bonds, viewing them as safer in uncertain times. Meanwhile, emerging markets like India and China are defying the trend, with yields slipping, thanks to domestic stability and tighter capital controls.

Listing lift

Chinese battery giant CATL made a striking debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, raising $4.6 billion in the largest global listing so far this year. Shares jumped over 16% from its listing price of HK$263 on the first day, highlighting strong investor demand for the world’s top EV battery maker, which supplies major automakers such as Tesla, BMW, and Volkswagen.

Holding a near 38% share of the global EV battery market, CATL plans to use the proceeds to accelerate its expansion in Europe. However, already listed in Shenzhen, CATL became entangled in escalating US-China tensions. The Pentagon designated CATL as a Chinese military-linked firm, and US lawmakers pressured Wall Street banks to avoid the listing, leading CATL to exclude US onshore investors entirely.

This move marks a shift from an era when Chinese giants like Alibaba thrived on Wall Street on debut. CATL’s Hong Kong listing reflects a changing financial landscape, with mainland firms increasingly turning to Hong Kong for capital amid rising US regulatory scrutiny.

On 23 February 1821, a young English doctor suffering from tuberculosis breathed his last on a tiny bed in a house near the Spanish Steps in Rome. In the last six years of his brief life, this 25-year-old man, who looked more like a wispy boy, had begun to write poetry. He had even published four volumes of his work, but none had sold much or got favourable reviews. His dying wish to his friends was to have the epitaph, “Here lies One Whose Name was Writ in Water," engraved on his gravestone. It was duly honoured.

To most of his contemporaries, John Keats was just another unknown poet, destined for obscurity. No one could have guessed the love and adulation he would be receiving more than 200 years after his death. Similar fates have befallen many creative spirits before and after Keats, the Bengali poet Jibanananda Das (1899-1954) being a classic example, who died, allegedly, in a road accident, mostly unsung and, worse, in penury. Some 70 years later, he is revered as one of the greatest Bengali poets since Rabindranath Tagore, while his works are translated widely into other languages.

So were Keats and Das failures in their lifetimes? With the benefit of hindsight, it’s hard to admit that they were but, from the perspective of the 21st-century free market, neither of them, indeed, didn’t amount to much by the time they breathed their last. To borrow from writer Amit Chaudhuri's essay The Intimacy of Failing, included in the recent volume On Failing edited by him, “In capitalism, only success has existence; there are no alternative, negative modes of existence."

From our earliest years, we are primed to think of failure as a stepping stone to success. A gazillion corporate gurus and startup bros on social media will tell you why you must fail and fail fast to achieve the nirvana of success. But what if failure doesn’t necessarily have any redeeming silver lining, at least not always? Why is it so hard for us to accept failure as an absolute reality, with no promise of recovery sweetening the deal?

Some of these questions surface in the handful of essays that feature in On Failing. This slim volume reproduces a series of talks delivered by writers, critics, poets and philosophers at a conference held in the Literary Activism series at Ashoka University, Sonipat, in 2020. Some of the submissions are darkly confessional, where the academic distance between the idea of failure and its intensely human experience is breached with impunity.

The opening piece by Clancy Martin, titled Suicide as a Sort of Failure, is a masterclass in writing personal essay. Grimly comic, self-lacerating, yet peculiarly shorn of any self-pity, it is an analysis of suicide as the ultimate act of failure. Martin’s first-person account gets to the heart of the matter: the double burden of being a failed suicide, a failure to successfully fail at living. It is a bravado performance, where writers David Foster Wallace and Édouard Levé make virtuoso appearances, a class act that sets the tone for the volume.

Bengali poet Ranajit Das’s acerbic reflections on his own “failure" meander through the life and times of Jibanananda Das (no relation of his), but the best piece in the collection, coming right after, is American writer Lydia Davis’s Learning to Sing. The second person narrator of the story (or is it a piece of memoir?) is a middle-aged woman, who has decided to learn to sing formally in the autumn of her life. She is well conversant with the grammar of music, reads the score in front of her effortlessly, but her voice keeps betraying her, stopping short of hitting the right note or sounding croaky to her own ears. She isn’t planning to be a star performer at this stage in her life, but she is driven by an inner resolve to achieve a certain level of excellence.

It’s a tense yet tender story of an individual’s deeply private struggle to attain a certain benchmark that isn’t set by society. Rather, she seeks validation from her inner critic, not even from the teacher who helps her blossom. Only a writer as masterful as Davis could unspool the public images of failure and success so subtly yet surely, nudging the reader to look within and question their own assumptions.

The two other pieces that make as strong an impression on the reader are poet Tiffany Atkinson’s reflections on her failed IVF treatment and filmmaker Anurag Kashyap’s raw and candid dissection of his career. In the former, a slip of tongue by an acquaintance at a party—“One door closes, another door shuts"— seems to encapsulate Atkinson’s difficulty with her disobedient body, failing to act according to medical protocol and make her pregnant.

In the latter, the reader gets a ringside view of the series of failures—from No Smoking to Bombay Velvet—that Kashyap had to wade his way through to get to where he is today. The most fascinating part of his soliloquy—for it reads like one, with its dramatic interjections—is the unpredictability of his moves, a refusal to follow the script of success, even when it lies bare before him after films like Gangs of Wasseypur and The Lunchbox.

For some of us, failure isn’t necessarily always a tragedy. It is often a way of life. It’s not a dirty word we shun, but a choice to avoid the ready and the easy way. We would much rather be misanthropes who dabble in failure, than be crowd-pleasers who only know how to cosy up to success.

Life is challenging by design, and most of us show up every day despite our daily struggles and do the best we can at work and at home. Human resilience, or expanding our capacity to manage life’s challenges and continue to move forward, becomes essential to ride the unpredictable and rocky waves of life with grace. It is a life skill that we can all master.

The challenges coming our way are an opportunity for learning and growth, and some challenges are particularly long and arduous. Meeting those challenges with sincere hard work and good faith, allows us to expand our lives into the ones we are meant to lead. I recently met Anupam Gulati, 47, director of culinary, Ritz Carlton hotel in Bengaluru, who has had 10-12-hour workdays almost every day of his career in hotel kitchens for the past 24 years and still loves what he does. The start of his career was challenging: His father wanted him to go to medical school but when he didn’t get through the entrance exams, he enrolled for a diploma in pharmacy. Despite registering as a pharmacist with the Delhi government, he decided to opt for hotel management and became one of the top students, winning competitions along the way.

At the end of the three-year programme at the Institute of Hotel Management, Lucknow, he couldn’t land a job in a hotel kitchen. Disheartened, he accompanied some friends who were interviewing for front-office jobs at the Oberoi Amarvilas in Agra. As he waited outside the interview room, someone in the senior management asked him what he was doing. “There is no position for me, I am interested in culinary," he said. As it turned out, there was an open position in culinary after all, and he was taken on as a culinary assistant. Those first two years were the hardest, he says, with long hours, tough bosses and a lot of criticism. He stuck it out. He was in his late 20s when he felt that hospitality was the career for him.

Gulati’s story is particularly striking given the mental health crisis that our teens and young adults appear to face today. A recent study—Correlates of Suicidal Ideation and Attempts among College Students in India: A Multi-State Cross-Sectional Survey—published in February in the Journal of Affective Disorders Reports found that 1 in 10 Indian college students has had suicidal thoughts in the last 12 months. Of those, a third attempted suicide. The study was done across 30 colleges in nine states and included 8,542 participants, aged 18-21. The authors found higher odds of suicide attempts in those students who “had bad or very bad quality of family relationships" and amongst those who consumed more alcohol or substances. The odds also went up if the student had spent time with a peer who is self-harming. The young people at greatest risk are the ones who were emotionally vulnerable.

That our young people are feeling so hopeless, and in such large numbers, is a call for urgent action. Our teens and young adults deserve to be supported in dealing with the pressures they face. There are structural issues that need to be addressed; more employment opportunities and career counselling is needed, to be sure, but we also need to help our young people build their capacity to withstand and persevere despite the challenges life is sure to bring. Study after study suggests that as a generation, they are woefully unprepared for life’s ups and downs.

When I shared the results of this study with Gulati, his response was, “Young people need to know that there is a good career path for all of us. We need to keep moving forward, be patient while making the best of the opportunities we do get. Being around people who support us and hearing inspiring stories helps too."

American biologist Stuart Kauffman was the first to coin the term “the adjacent possible" in 1996, which describes the realm of innovation and discovery that lies just beyond our current knowledge. It is a shadow future of sorts in which the conceivable is within reach, yet requires bold action to attain it.

Translated into the psychological realm, we develop our capacity for life when we venture into the adjacent possible that waits for us, just outside our comfort zone. The adjacent possible is the growth zone in which we can challenge ourselves and explore new ways of being, doing, feeling and thinking. We need to find ways of nudging our teens and young adults towards the adjacent possible in their lives. It is in adjacent possible that the sweet fruit of resilience lies.

Many teenagers and young adults today are content to leave the unseen unexplored. They have grown up in the digital age where so much is available by clicking buttons and tapping keys that perhaps they have become accustomed to not exploring the real world. They are inadvertently robbing themselves of the real-world experiences they desperately need to build their capacity for life. It is up to the adults in their lives to shake them out of this reverie with kindness. They need the unconditional support of their parents, mentors and coaches to build their capacity for life, or their resilience. Indeed we must all think about building our resilience, so that we may expand our lives into the ones we are meant to lead.

The union consumer affairs minister is quite right when he terms ‘advance tipping’, introduced by ride hailing apps such as Uber, Ola and Rapido, an unfair trade practice.

In a post on X last week Pralhad Joshi wrote, “Forcing or nudging users to pay a tip in advance for faster service is unethical and exploitative," adding, “Tip is given as a token of appreciation, not as a matter of right, after the service."

On the minister’s prodding, the Central Consumer Protection Authority is probing the matter and has already issued a notice to Uber. Similar notices to Ola and Rapido, asking them to explain this practice, are likely to follow.

Following Rapido, Ola and Uber recently absolved themselves of setting a price for an autorickshaw ride. They do provide an ‘indicative’ price range, but it is left to the consumer to negotiate the final price with the driver.

In addition, these apps have introduced an ‘advance tip’ system, nudging users to pay a little extra. They claim users who do so are more likely to get a ride, since the extra amount goes to the driver.

It remains to be seen what the Central Consumer Protection Authority says about this. On the face of it this kind of ‘price nudging’, while irritating, is not illegal per se – at least not at the moment. But it is certainly not ethical, and may be downright illegal if this ‘advance tip’ system is found to be linked with faster ride-allocation at the back end.

Price gouging in another form?

It also offers a veneer of technological respectability to what is simply price gouging by vehicle operators. It is an open secret that ‘going by the meter’ is the exception rather than the rule in most Indian cities. Operators of metered public transport vehicles such as autorickshaws and taxis tend to charge arbitrary fares, refusing to go by the meter, because the law is rarely enforced, if ever. Consumers, caught between the need to travel and the lack of options, end up paying the price.

What ride-hailing apps have done is to legitimise this in the name of ‘advance tipping’. These apps don’t make money unless a ride is actually completed and paid for, so it is in their interest to encourage more rides by incentivising operators to actually offer their services.

Tipping culture

There is of course the larger question of tipping and where it is appropriate, or even necessary, to add a tip. In the US, where tipping is widespread, several studies have shown that it is directly linked to minimum wages. Several states in the US have two different minimum wages – a higher one without tips, and a much lower one, where the employer is supposed to allow employees to make up the difference through tips.

That is not the case in India. Our minimum wages are not only low, but are calculated taking into account only basic requirements such as food and shelter. ‘Social’ requirements such as education and healthcare are not factored in. We have a ‘Code on Wages’ that was passed five years ago but has not yet been implemented. There is also a national minimum floor wage but it is non-binding and most states have chosen not to implement it in a bid to attract investments. Minimum wages have not been revised for the past five years, despite high inflation.

Platforms have bypassed even existing laws by classifying service providers as ‘independent contractors’ rather than employees. The authorities are trying to address this through regulation. In the case of ride-hailing apps, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi already have rules covering this, including caps on surge pricing, driver licensing and onboarding requirements, vehicle inspection protocols, and insurance mandates. Many other states have similar measures in the works.

But these rules are consumer-facing and don’t address the needs of the vehicle operators. This has led to widespread ride denials, which in turn has prompted the advance tipping ‘fix’. Gig workers on other types of platforms – food delivery, quick commerce, e-commerce, and personal and household services – do not even have this vestige of legal protection.

Root of the problem

All this is symptomatic of a deeper malaise – the failure to implement the letter and spirit of the law. It is not that we don’t have laws, rules and regulations. It’s that they are simply not enforced, or enforced so weakly that there is flagrant disregard for them. The ride-share market came into being because of the lack of enforcement of the meter system, as well as the artificial scarcity created in taxi and autorickshaw licences.

Their failure to provide a fair return to the service providers has in turn created space for workarounds such as pseudo-voluntary fare hikes in the form of surge pricing and advance tipping. Unless the root cause is fixed, such irregularities are bound to recur, and the consumer will pay the price.

The idea that you could walk into a neighborhood store, buy a phone, insert a SIM card and start calling family and friends within hours would have been the stuff of science fiction in pre-1990s India. Which is why the telecom sector is considered the poster child of the transformative powers of the reforms of 1991, which threw open a moribund government monopoly to the private sector.

But a phone in every Indian's hand isn't a story of a smooth and steady transition. It is a tale of bitter business rivalries, some wise and some inept government handling, fierce maneuverings in courts, and a whole host of characters who played significant parts in the decades-long drama. It is also a story of the rise and fall of many entrepreneurs who cut their teeth in this most demanding of industries, culminating in a rank outsider, Sunil Mittal, emerging as the champion of champions. Above all, it's a tale which wasn't fully captured in any book so far.

Former journalist and author Deepali Gupta steps in to fill that breach with her new book, Telecom Wars, and does so with skill and substance. Sensibly, her book follows a straightforward chronological order, which allows even those who were eyewitnesses to the revolution to catch up on minor but critical elements. Take the incident where Analjit Singh of Max Telecom went for a meeting at the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in 1993 to demonstrate his company’s newly launched pager service. A chance remark by an official there convinced him that the future of communications lay in mobile telephony rather than in pagers. Singh would go on to be one of the big financial winners with the sale of his telecom business to Vodafone.

Another opportunistic winner was Warburg Pincus, which bought into Bharti Airtel against the advice of its consultants. Its $30 million cheque in 1999, which allowed Mittal to go on a shopping spree on his way to becoming an all-India service provider, would grow to over $300 million by 2001. The private equity firm eventually encashed its 19% stake for $1.8 billion in 2004. No story on Airtel is complete without mention of its first jingle composed by the music maestro A.R. Rahman. Gupta says the signature tune became so popular that it “could even be heard in the reverse gear alert of the small family car Maruti 800."

Anecdotes aside, the book also provides detailed accounts of the battles within the battle, including the crucial choice of technology standards between rivals, Code-division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), or the scramble between equipment vendors like Lucent, Motorola, Ericsson, Siemens and Nokia for a slice of what would grow to be the world’s second largest telecom market.

In addition there are the backstories of some of the more mysterious characters in the decades-long drama; men like the tea-trader Mahendra Nahata whose company Himachal Futuristic would twice play a huge role in the evolving sector. The first came with his eye-popping ₹85,000 crore bid for the first set of telecom licenses in 1995 which had Parliament in a tizzy, leading to angry exchanges between the colorful telecom minister, Sukh Ram, who would eventually be arrested and jailed, and opposition members like Pramod Mahajan from the Bharatiya Janata Party and Nilotpal Basu from the left. Nahata, would surface again in 2010 when his company, Infotel Broadband Services, became the only one to win broadband spectrum in all 22 zones in India in the auction, only for the company to be immediately bought by Reliance Industries.

Gupta is in her element while detailing such oddities including that curious hybrid entity, incredibly named Batata, a three way partnership between Birla, Tata and AT&T. The marriage of two of India's largest conglomerates with the world leader in telecom services turned out to be an ill-fated one.

The flurry of action through the first two decades when multiple companies from India and abroad lay claim to a piece of the turf, gave way by 2016 to a battle between a powerful new entrant and a dozen incumbents. Jio’s epic launch started a devastating race to the bottom. Only three of those who started, finished: Kumar Birla’s Idea Cellular, Vodafone and Bharti Airtel.

Much of Gupta’s material is sourced from media reports over the years including many which she filed. By piecing together these reports, editorials and columns, along with analysts notes and conversations into a single cohesive story, she's able to present an engaging and insightful book.

By no means is this a comprehensive account of the events surrounding the privatization of the sector, though. That would need an entire case study. To the author’s credit she has avoided making it one, refusing to editorialise or offer her own interpretation or even hold out lessons for others.

The book is at its weakest in its conclusion, which reads more like a news report on the current situation. Perhaps publishing deadlines didn't allow for a more elaborate chapter than the short three-page apology to the present at the end.

Every morning, I wake to a fresh layer of golden fuzz covering the floor. Musafir, our golden retriever, is shedding with great enthusiasm. If you’re a pet parent in India right now, chances are your home looks similar and you’re wondering how to manage the shedding.

Summer shedding is natural. Most dogs shed to some degree year-round, but you’ll notice a marked increase when the weather changes. As temperatures rise, dogs lose their winter coats. This seasonal shedding helps them adapt to warmer weather. While we can’t stop the shedding, we can manage it.

One of the simplest, most effective ways to deal with shedding is brushing. Regular brushing removes loose fur, reduces tangles, and helps distribute natural oils across your pet’s coat. The type of brush and frequency will vary depending on your dog’s breed and coat type.

For double-coated breeds like golden retrievers, huskies and German shepherds, a slicker brush or an undercoat rake used daily or every other day during the shedding season works wonders. These breeds have a dense undercoat that sheds in clumps, and tools designed specifically to reach that layer make a huge difference. Short-haired breeds such as beagles or dachshunds benefit from a rubber curry brush or a grooming glove. Poodles and other curly coated dogs don’t shed much but still require grooming to prevent matting—use a pin brush or a comb a few times a week.

Vacuuming is another way of dealing with the fur. Invest in a vacuum cleaner with a good pet hair attachment and use it frequently. Wash cushion covers, throws and rugs often.

You might also consider adding omega oil supplements to your pet’s diet, after consulting your vet. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids help support skin health and coat condition, reducing dryness and dandruff, both of which can exacerbate shedding. Of course, results aren’t immediate; it takes a few weeks of regular use for the effects to show.

The summer shedding phase can last from a few weeks to a couple of months, depending on your dog’s breed, age, and health. Dogs that spend a lot of time outdoors are influenced by seasonal changes and natural light, while those kept primarily indoors in air-conditioned environments may shed more year-round. If your pet’s shedding seems excessive, or if it’s accompanied by bald spots, itching, redness or any signs of discomfort, it’s important to dig deeper.

Skin infections, allergies, hormonal imbalances or parasitic infestations can all cause abnormal shedding or poor coat quality. In India, tick-borne illnesses such as ehrlichiosis or babesiosis can also affect skin and coat health. If in doubt, visit your vet for a thorough checkup.

This brings me to Ella, a golden retriever I recently met. Her parent, frustrated with her summer shedding, had shaved her coat down to the skin. It’s a common enough reaction, driven by the belief that removing fur will help dogs feel cooler and reduce shedding. Unfortunately, it does neither.

Shaving a double-coated dog can cause more harm than good. Their coat is designed to provide insulation—it keeps them warm in winter and cool in summer by regulating body temperature and protecting the skin from the sun. When you shave it, you disrupt this natural process. What’s more, the undercoat often grows back faster and denser than the topcoat, leading to permanent damage to coat texture. It also increases the risk of sunburn and skin irritation.

Instead of shaving, focus on helping your dog stay cool in other ways. Provide plenty of fresh water, ensure there are shaded spots or cool indoor areas for them to rest and avoid walks during the hottest parts of the day.

Fur on the sofa, on your clothes or in your morning tea can be frustrating, but is part of the package when you have a pet, and can be managed easily.

The seventh edition of Aadyam Theatre Festival features, among other plays, a musical, Mumbai Star , directed by Nadir Khan. The story of an underdog, this production was conceived as a project by the Min-On Concert Association, Tokyo, and it has now come to India with a renewed vision. When you start watching the newly-minted Mumbai Star , you instinctively know what to expect. The story is full of every imaginable Hindi film trope possible. A young boy, Dev, from a coastal village in Maharashtra, hopes to make it big in Maximum City. The story takes you through hardships in the city, young love, discovery of a mentor, and a reality show that promises to transform lives. There is also friendship, conflict, and opposition to the love story.

Produced by Devika Shahani and choreographed by Avantika Bahl, the cast features 15 dancers and two actors— Rajit Kapur and Srishti Shrivastava. From its earlier dance musical avatar that toured Japan in 2023, it has been reimagined with a fresh narrator’s arc by Akarsh Khurana and Arghya Lahiri. Mumbai Star is an exercise in scale and excesses with theatrics that have little to do with the story.

But it delivers exactly what it promises— the experience of a Western dance musical rooted in a modern Indian context. And it does it through a guru-shishya story embedded in Kathak, a dance form that Shahani wanted to include in the performance.

Khan makes no qualms about the cliches in the play. He is joyful in the rehearsal room and as much a cheerleader of the cast as its director. “I believe there is no story that has not been told. But the telling is brand new," he says. “I see myself as a sponge, trying to absorb and learn everything I can. With this production, it’s been an immersion into the world of dance. And we’ve only just got a foot in the door," he says. Khan had earlier directed Sing India Sing, a large-scale musical produced by Aadyam Theatre in 2018. “That was my baptism by fire. It was unfamiliar territory. But, it's storytelling at the end of the day," he adds.

The 11 songs, composed by Dhruv Ghanekar, have been sung by leading vocalists like Sunidhi Chauhan, Kunal Ganjawala and Nakash Aziz. The Kathak pieces have been guest-choreographed by Sangeet Natak Akademi awardee Uma Dogra. To portray the versatility of the dance landscape of the country, the performance also features jazz, and hip-hop, with the occasional romantic ballad. Choreographer Avantika Bahl was at first intimidated by the idea but soon got on board. “It was a combination of forms that we wanted to bring on the stage. It has a little bit of everything, and that is an accurate representation of the dance world," she says.

Most of her learnings stemmed from the scale and the idea of looking beyond choreography and composition. “With a dance show, the primary language is the physical vocabulary. Here we were at the crossroads of music, storytelling and dance. The idea was for them to hold hands and take the story forward," she says.

Kapur is a joy to watch on stage and brings a few laughs to the show. While he and Shrivastava add much-needed depth to the narrative and deliver heartwarming performances, the focus remains on the dance numbers. The songs are pre-recorded, and unlike most musical theatre shows, there is no live singing. Avenav Mukherjee steals the show as Dev, who evolves from a vulnerable boy into an overconfident performer.

Shahani believes her strength lies in building a great team. “The most important thing is to get people, who come into the room with their whole soul," she says.

‘Mumbai Star’ will be performed on 25 May at the St Andrew’s Auditorium, Mumbai, 4 pm and 7.30 pm and on 14-15 June at Kamani Auditorium, New Delhi, 7.30 pm.

What does it mean to be creative? Is it finding beauty in the simplest of things, coaxing it out of everyday objects, or is it an expression of joy and whimsy? If it is true that constraint breeds creativity, few restaurants exemplify that ethic better than Copenhagen’s three-star Michelin restaurant, Noma. When I first ate there in 2014, I was blown away. The experience, from start to finish, was out-of-the-box, pushing on boundaries I did not know existed. It became the benchmark against which all other dining experiences were measured.

For the entire duration of that meal, my senses were jolted by new flavours, textures and experiences. I was served caramelised milk extruded into thin fettuccine wafers and scallops that had been dried, ground into a powder and recombined with beeswax so it could be served as a mousse. The sea urchin was served on the crispy skin of a duck, and the steak tartare was seasoned with flash-frozen fire ants—the only way they could find to introduce tart acidity into the dish without using a citrus fruit.

In those days, Noma strictly adhered to a self-imposed rule to cook only with ingredients sourced roughly 200km from the restaurant. This is why they went to extraordinary lengths to reproduce the taste of lemons, and why, in the sparse winter months, diners were served reindeer moss and roasted celeriac.

It is such constraints that sparked creativity and pushed Noma to the top of the culinary world. Nothing comes easy in the harsh Nordic north, and the effort of coaxing flavours and textures out of whatever was available showcased the region’s resilience and gave them a repertoire of skills unmatched in the food industry.

Earlier this month, I returned to Noma, well over a decade later. Since my last visit, the restaurant had shut down and resurrected itself in a new avatar, moving to a new location on the outskirts of Copenhagen. Noma 2.0 no longer forages for its food locally, but crafts its menu according to the season, serving produce from the oceans in winter, vegetables in the summer and game from the forests in autumn.

I came to this meal with high expectations, but within the first few courses, it was clear that something was off. I guess it all went downhill after the snail course—a delicate morsel served in a bouquet of wasabi leaves.

While there was nothing wrong with the dish itself, it would have helped if they had not placed a live snail on the dish for effect. As soon as it saw its brother being eaten, mine hightailed it off my plate and on to the table. Pandemonium ensued as servers and diners alike tried to retrieve the snails so that service could resume.

Don’t get me wrong, the food was delicious—skilfully prepared and exotically eclectic in assembly. The shrimp in magnolia petals was exquisite, delicately floral and tinged with a hit of ginger. And the calamari, cured in kelp and served with poppy seeds, was worth the price of admission all on its own.

That said, the experience as a whole felt performative—as if, having built their reputation on using flash-frozen ants to produce citrus acidity, they now felt compelled to keep performing new feats of even more outrageous creativity.

Our next stop was Barcelona, where we had reservations to eat at Disfrutar, currently, the top-ranked restaurant in the world. Located in the very heart of Barcelona, behind an unpretentious storefront that gives little indication of the magic that is being wrought inside, this (thanks to its one year waiting list) is one of the hardest tables to get in the world. As an added treat we learned, just before we boarded the flight for Spain, that we were going to be seated in the R&D kitchen in the basement for the “Living Table" experience.

If Noma distils Nordic austerity, Disfrutar, which translates to “enjoy" in Spanish, epitomises Catalan exuberance. That joy was expressed in the cheeky smiley face that’s part of the restaurant logo, and then again in the attitude of every member of the staff throughout the meal.

The first thing we were served was the amuse-bouche, a concoction of passion fruit and rum presented in the form of an eclair that popped in our mouths when we ate it. I was immediately transported back to the mid-2000s when this sort of molecular gastronomy was all the rage.

I should not have been surprised. The three chefs behind Disfrutar—Oriol Castro, Eduard Xatruch and Mateu Casañas—previously worked at El Bulli, universally regarded as the most influential establishment in the history of modern gastronomy. Rumour has it that it was Castro, not Ferran Adrià, who was the real wizard of that culinary laboratory, so it should not have been a surprise that a restaurant helmed by him would take such a playful approach.

There are about 20 courses on the classic menu at Disfrutar, but we did not have to wait for long before we were served the legendary Caviar Panchino. Deceptively unpretentious in appearance, the Panchino presents as a brown sphere, light and airy to the touch. Bite into it and the crust dissolves in your mouth, revealing an unctuous filling of caviar and cream. How on earth did they manage to fry a bun till it was crisp and still ensure that the caviar didn’t cook? We asked and with refreshing openness, they showed us a video of how it was cooked.

This candour, I discovered, is part of the Disfrutar DNA. At the end of the year, the restaurant compiles and publishes as a book, all they cooked over the course of the year, releasing the precise recipes with extensive commentary to anyone who cares to ask. This lack of proprietariness around their innovations is refreshing, and in stark contrast to so many of us who go to extraordinary lengths to keep inventions secret.

As the meal progressed, we were treated to more and more examples of quixotic brilliance. When I reached to pick up one of the portions, I found myself clutching at air—the real dish was hidden and I had been looking at a reflection. Later, in a not-so-thinly veiled dig at the “Instagram-ification" of food, the plate on which the food was served was attached to a mirror so that every photograph of the food was also an image of me photographing food.

We were also part of the cooking experience. One course was served in an eggshell and topped off with a truffle-flavoured tempura. We were invited to bite off the top of the tempura and pour the liquid egg yolk found inside it on to the mushroom jelly inside the shell. We could then drink the broth with the tempura for crunch. But they had saved the best for last—a grand finale the likes of which I have never experienced before.

Once the meal was over and all the plates cleared, the covers were removed to reveal the table below it—one that had been specially fabricated for this moment. As the music swelled to a crescendo, the server explained that this was the living table, a symbolic reflection of the city of Barcelona itself, embodying its creativity and joyful enjoyment. And as he did that, the table itself came to life.

Servers synchronised their movements to the music and the narrative, opening little compartments and revealing an assortment of petit fours that had been hiding beneath all the time. The entire presentation took 10 minutes, the music swelling in intensity as more of the table was uncovered until, by the time the music stopped, our dining table had been transformed into a glorious tableau of confectionery that somehow also reimagined the city’s grid layout.

The ability to produce great food under the constraints of time and region is admirable. But a meal is not memorable unless it evokes an emotional response. The Noma kitchen will always shine brightly for its technical brilliance, its mastery over produce and meticulous execution. But I will remember Disfrutar for the smile it put on my face and the standing ovation we spontaneously burst into once the music had died down. Noma showed us what excellence looks like.

Constraint is all well and good, but a meal isn’t great unless it sparks joy.

This week, I indulged in some R&R (rest and relaxation), giving in to the intense summer days here in Puducherry. The afternoon lulls you into a state of inertia, and mirroring the life outside, I too chose to retreat inwards.

This week also saw the International Tea Day (celebrated on 21 May) with the theme being “Tea for better lives". There’s a lot of preoccupation with the sustainability of the tea industry, in particular its financial viability. But this, as I discovered last month, is not new.

I spent half a day at the UPASI (United Planters’ Association of Southern India) library in Coonoor. UPASI was formed back in 1893 and remains an important planters’ body. My sights were set on the collection of old planters’ magazines. In 1895, a weekly magazine was started for planters by planters, called Planting Opinion. Later, it changed to The Planter’s Chronicle and it continues to be published. Besides the occasional “light reading" and verse, it packs a lot of information.

As I read through some of the issues from its earliest years, it was quite apparent that the problems of planters have not really changed a century later. Back then too, they were grappling with some of the same concerns, of pest and disease, of enough labour, of markets. UPASI (1893-1953) published in 1955 notes “a shadow of depression was spreading over the industry" with “under consumption" described as a problem. One contributor says that both coffee and tea were in trouble from 1898, adding “there is a familiar ring in many of the discussions, which, taken from their context, might have occurred in 1931 or 1952."

Or 2025, as we may add. A century gone and much has changed and yet, nothing has. True of tea as it’s of the world.

I look at the assortment of tea in my cupboard—some Darjeeling black, a Kangra gunpowder green, chunks of a tea brick I have been hacking away at, some Taiwanese Dong Ding from my recent acquisition with a yet unopened Baozhong oolong, a Ceylon green tea, some black tea from Nuwara Eliya that I am rationing—I am reminded of an atlas of land and water forms I had read years ago. Entire continents were marked solely on the basis of their land forms, not political borders. It was beautiful. When I see the teas in my cupboard, it is a tad messy in how they are stacked, but it’s without borders and is comfortably neighbourly. I catch myself wishing the world finds harmony despite its deep divides.

I choose the Baozhong, once famous as the Formosa oolong, recently sourced from Hsu Hao Sheng, who goes by the name Sean, at Trilliant Tea (accepts orders online). It is by far one of the most aromatic teas I have enjoyed recently, with an incredibly sweet fragrance, like the scent of flowers that bloom at night. I steeped it for 6 minutes in boiling water. It’s a lightly oxidised tea, as seen in the still green leaves. The tea itself is flavourful and sweet but with these oolongs, it’s the after taste I have come to await. And the Baozhong brought such sweetness, it’s one of my favourites this year and I recommend it as one to linger with on moody days.

Fitness routines can seem as if they are only geared towards the body working against gravity in order to work the muscles. Popular examples of these are incline walks and box jumps and hill runs. But these are not the only way to use gravity to your advantage; you can also do so by practicing landing exercises. And there is one exercise in particular that takes the cake when it comes to its overall effect on the body, which goes beyond just the ability to withstand force. This is the drop jump.

The drop jump, or the death drop as it is also known, is one of the most popular exercises among those who want to work on their strength and speed. The ease of learning the exercise and modifying it while jumping from a height, with very little equipment, makes it one of the first moves that runners learn when they start getting serious about the activity.

I wrote a piece for Lounge on landing and its importance in December 2021, which included multiple exercises that can help in landing during plyometric training. The drop jump is more specific though, as it eventually progresses to a drop jump followed by a box jump. The exercise is probably also the most risk free plyometric move that even beginners can accommodate in their routine. That said, be careful.

You can start doing this off a bench as well, or any platform for that matter, including stairs. Just make sure you’re wearing the right footwear, or you can train this barefoot. There are many studies that show that doing plyometrics without shoes can increase the activation of foot muscles and decrease the load on the knees. “For individuals unaccustomed to barefoot activity or those with weaker intrinsic foot muscles who wish to improve their foot strength, commencing barefoot with lower-intensity plyometrics such as Pogo variations, low box jumps, or hopping may be prudent before advancing to higher-intensity exercises like bounding and depth jumps," says a health+high performance article on the topic.

However you choose to do it, start with a low height so the body learns to recognise the sensation of landing. The technique will get better over time but the execution is simple. Here’s what to do: get on the platform and then let one leg hang over the edge in preparation for the landing and just jump, making sure you land in a soft cushioned quarter squat. It’s fair to wonder if that’s all there is to the entire exercise. There is one more step though—and it’s so much fun. Because as soon as you land, you make sure you take a small spot jump after.

Running and strength training coach Lucy Molloy recently posted the findings of a fascinating 2019 research about death drop jumps in an Instagram post which also shows how she does the exercise. She cites the study, Effects Of Plyometric Training On The Performance Of 5-km Road Runners, published in the Journal of Physical Education and Sport, which trialled 24 runners and split them into three groups.

The group which did this exercise as part of their plyometric protocol showed stunning results in increase of speed. These are the results: The run-only group showed an average 4.75s improvement; the run and squat jump group showed an improvement of 140.5 seconds and the run and drop jump group showed a 170.63s improvement.

“The benefit of death drop jumps to runners is it increases the capacity of explosive strength and also works to decrease foot contact time with the ground, ultimately decreasing the amount of energy used for a given speed," Molloy writes in her post.

Executing the drop jump is in itself is quite easy when you consider the scale of other exercises that also work on increasing speed and running mechanics. And even the progressions are quite interesting. The death-jump-to-box-jump is the best progression. It is challenging, works up a sweat, and makes your lower body coordinated when it comes to quick movements. The difference here is that you do the drop off a bench, and then jump straight onto a box, using the upwards momentum from the landing to fuel the jump onto the box.

There is also a playground element to this exercise. Very much like turning large tyres in a functional training session, or slamming them with a hammer. Doing drop jumps with a circle of gym friends can give in to a childlike excitement of executing the perfect landing and jump and the challenges can keep increasing. For example, one could use ankle weights to do them and get stronger. There are many exercises that can help amp your speed up, but none is simpler than the drop jump.

ZARICHNE, Ukraine — Kyrylo Horbenko was 16 years old in the summer of 2023 when he and two dozen of his male friends walked into an army recruitment office in east Ukraine and announced they wanted to fight Russian troops on the front lines.

The officials on duty laughed them out, telling them to come back when they were adults. The others later lost interest or went abroad, Horbenko said. But he enlisted immediately after turning 18 in March.

“Who is going to fight, if not us?" the gangly teen asked as he prepared for his army induction course at a training ground in east Ukraine last month.

What separates Horbenko from the thousands of battle-hardened soldiers he will soon serve alongside is that when he signed up, he secured for himself an interest-free mortgage, a rare chance to vacation abroad and the first installment of a sign-on bonus totaling a 1 million Ukrainian hryvnia, equivalent to about $24,000—a sum that exceeds many experienced soldiers’ yearly pay.

The fresh recruit is among hundreds who have signed up since February through a generous new government program aimed at enticing Ukraine’s youngest adults into the country’s badly depleted armed forces. The numbers signing up so far are modest. But Ukraine’s leaders hope that in time the program, known as Contract 18-24, will help chase down a demographic they have largely sought to spare from the front lines.

That they are doing so reflects the severity of the manpower deficit that has hobbled Ukraine’s defense effort in the face of a relentless Russian onslaught in the country’s east. Most men willing to fight signed up long ago, and enlisting more is getting harder each year. Many eligible men—those between 18 and 60 who are banned from leaving the country—are either in hiding or have paid bribes to flee the country illegally and escape the draft.

Kyiv has sought various ways to replenish its ranks after almost 3½ years of full-scale war. It has raided nightclubs, allowed convicts early release from prison and unveiled billboards throughout the country proclaiming: “Everyone is going to fight." Last year it lowered the age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25, which only temporarily boosted numbers.

Western allies have long called on Kyiv to lower the age further, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has rebuffed such calls, arguing Ukraine needs its youth to rebuild the country once fighting ends. “It’s very important for me to safeguard the lives of our people, our youth," he told a French newspaper in December.

Meanwhile, 18- to 24-year-olds have been largely free to get on with their lives—even as commanders argue that their verve and energy would bolster Ukraine’s aging and exhausted force.

That is where Contract 18-24 comes in. It dangles various perks in return for a one-year commitment to the military, and alongside the 1 million Ukrainian hryvnia it offers a monthly salary equivalent to almost $3,000, six times the national average in Ukraine. There is also free college tuition and discounted dental care.

A recruitment push for the program has featured TikTok videos, viral social-media posts and shiny billboards that stand on the central streets of Ukraine’s major cities—all of them with a Gen Z twist.

One video posted in March to the TikTok account of Ukraine’s Defense Ministry asked: How many McDonald’s cheese burgers does 1 million hryvnia buy in Ukraine? (The answer, apparently, is 15,625).

Ukraine’s move to attract new recruits with high salaries and mortgage help echoes similar moves in Russia, which has managed to bring tens of thousands of men into its armed forces by offering generous sign-on bonuses that dwarf average salaries in most parts of the country.

Russia last year announced an expansion of its armed forces by 180,000 people, to 1.5 million active service members. Zelensky said in January that Ukraine has almost a million people in arms, and officials say the army is adding 30,000 people a month.

But few young people are swayed by Contract 18-24 so far. The government says only around 500 have joined the scheme since it launched in February. A wall of bureaucracy often delays the process of onboarding recruits, and many get cold feet or drop out under pressure from their parents, according to Ukrainian officials, who caution that it is still too early to judge its success.

Behind the program’s slick promotional campaign is a tough decision it places before Ukraine’s youth.

With no peace on the horizon despite a monthslong diplomatic push by President Trump, male Ukrainian teens often say the choice before them is to either join the military or to try a professional career that may be cut short by mobilization once they turn 25. Many choose emigration instead.

Timur Ushak has watched as one classmate after another has moved abroad from his town in east Ukraine, mostly to Poland or Germany. The 16-year-old is now studying the Slovak language ahead of a planned move to Bratislava for university studies next year.

“If I leave, I know it’s probably for good," said the tall, athletic teenager, who says he has lost faith in Ukraine after 10 years of conflict that is drawing ever closer to his town, Kamianske. “I don’t believe the war will end."

There is also some resentment among older Ukrainian servicemen, who dislike the preferential treatment of the Contract 18-24 cohort. The generous sign-on bonus of 1 million hryvnia has inspired a mocking nickname for its participants: “the millionaires."

Maj. Yevheniy Hromadsky, a 24-year-old soldier who in 2022 received the Hero of Ukraine medal, the country’s highest military award, said he earned only 12,000 hryvnia a month when he fought in the defense of Kharkiv in the first months of the war—a battle in which he lost his father.

Hromadsky, who joined the military at the age of 18, said there is a subtle generational divide between his peers, who experienced their formative years after Russia annexed Crimea and invaded east Ukraine in 2014, and those who are teenagers today.

Most young Ukrainians became desensitized to the risk of war when the conflict with Russia abated between 2018 and 2021, Hromadsky said. Those years of relative peace, he argues, bred complacency and decreased their willingness to fight.

He argues that the best way to keep Ukraine’s army staffed is to introduce two years of mandatory military service between the ages of 18 and 20, after which conscripts can receive a university education at the state’s expense.

“The army needs logisticians, we need engineers," Hromadsky said. “We need people with a higher education."

Horbenko, the fresh Contract 18-24 recruit, is aware that his enthusiasm for military service is unusual. He has spent years preparing, researching weapons and Ukrainian army units, and tracking Russian and Ukrainian battlefield advances.

After high school, while still underage, he took a job at the post office. While he helped dispatch humanitarian aid packages to troops on the front, he spent his days wondering: Why should I sit here, hiding away?

The day he signed his military contract in March, he drove past his mother’s workplace to share the news before continuing on to the training base where he is now staying. She told him: I knew this day would eventually come.

“It’s because others are hiding from recruitment officers that 18-year-olds like me are signing contracts," Horbenko said.

Oleksandr Bahach, another recruit, waited months for the military to get in touch after he turned 18 and registered his interest last year. Several weeks ago, he saw an online ad for the 18-24 program and submitted an application that was quickly approved.

“I would collect all the men in the country and send them to the front," said the 19-year-old. “The bitter truth is that we’re losing this war." Bahach cites Bakhmut, Avdiivka and other key battles of the war as inspiration for his decision to fight.

The two young men are now preparing to take their oath of service and begin basic military training for Ukraine’s 25th Airborne Brigade. After a month and a half, they will be allowed to choose a specialization in the brigade. After another 4½ months of specialized training, they will serve half a year on the front lines.

They spend their evenings at the training ground watching videos of Ukrainian military operations to ready themselves mentally to be in trenches for real, or familiarizing themselves with their new equipment, including radios and tactical bodywear. Horbenko worries he is too emotional and short-tempered and is steeling himself for what is to come.

“I’m preparing for the worst, so that when it happens I can stay calm and handle it," he said.

UBRIQUE, Spain—Europe’s luxury brands have long sold pricey handbags based on the mystique of where they’re made. Now the trade war is probing the value of producing in places like this sun-kissed town.

Ubrique’s workshops have pumped out leather goods for Chanel, Louis Vuitton and other brands for years, employing about a quarter of the town’s population of 16,000. A giant statue of the patacabra, a wooden tool used to shape and smooth the leather, rises by the road leading into town.

“We’re all basically living off leather here," said José Antonio Bautista, the town’s deputy mayor.

President Trump’s tariffs are now shaking the foundations of Ubrique’s business model—and that of the broader luxury industry. On Friday, Trump threatened a 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union.

European brands have long cultivated the image that Old World heritage uniquely positions the continent to create goods for the world’s most discerning customers—justifying their eye-watering price tags.

While high margins offer brands some protection from tariffs, Trump’s push to shift production to the U.S. has sparked fresh scrutiny of the “Made in Europe" value proposition. The worry for some brands: Luxury goods produced in America won’t carry the same cachet with consumers.

“It wouldn’t make sense to me to have Italian Gucci bags made in Texas," François-Henri Pinault, chief executive of the group that owns Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, told French lawmakers earlier this month. “It doesn’t make sense to my clients. I can’t explain that."

The allure of European provenance is already being questioned in the industry’s second-biggest market: China. After Trump announced his tariffs, a wave of videos flooded TikTok, purporting to reveal the true cost of luxury by showing how a range of high-end handbags—including the Hermès Birkin, which sell for more than $10,000—can be cheaply counterfeited in a Chinese factory.

The scrutiny has shone a spotlight on places like Ubrique, where first-year trainees start on the equivalent of around $30 a day, and the most experienced workers earn a daily wage of roughly $57, according to a local labor agreement.

Shifting production to the U.S., however, is easier said than done. Louis Vuitton opened a leather-goods workshop in Alvarado, Texas, in 2019 as part of a push to diversify manufacturing and meet growing demand in its largest market. But scaling up has proven difficult.

The site has faced growing pains as Louis Vuitton struggled to recruit and train local artisans. LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault said he planned to hire a thousand staff at the plant when it initially opened, but years later the facility only employs around 300 people—a slower-than-expected expansion that the company partly attributes to the pandemic.

Still, Arnault recently said the group would “inevitably be forced to increase its American production" if the EU fails to reach a deal to avert Trump’s tariffs.

A town built on leather

Spain quietly plays a central role in the global luxury supply chain—especially in leather goods.

Nowhere is that more evident than in Ubrique, where leather craftsmanship took off in the 19th century—helped by the town’s abundant water supply, crucial for softening hides and dyeing leather.

The area’s isolation and poverty played a role too. Families raised livestock while women began sewing and finishing leather goods at home. By the 1970s, Ubrique had become a byword for craftsmanship, drawing brands like Dior and Loewe.

Today, handbag makers rely on Ubrique’s extensive network of suppliers, specialized machinery makers, tanneries and logistics hubs that have developed together over decades.

Their close proximity enables speed and flexibility, which are crucial in an industry that is constantly working on new designs. Workshops often work hand-in-hand with brands to develop prototypes and refine products. Longstanding relationships have fostered trust and discretion, helping protect sourcing strategies and unreleased designs.

Chanel purses are made in a discreet workshop with no signage, while Louis Vuitton relies on a longstanding supplier with several sites across town to produce pieces including a $3,000 hobo-style bag.

Ubrique’s rich industrial ecosystem would be difficult, and take years, to replicate elsewhere. Similar tightknit luxury clusters can be found in Tuscany for leather goods, La Chaux-de-Fonds for Swiss watches and the French town of Grasse for perfume.

Economic forces have threatened Ubrique before. During the 2008 financial crisis, many luxury brands moved production to lower-cost countries like China. The result: factory closures, job losses and economic pain.

“You’d see people who had nothing to eat coming here asking for help," said Bautista, the deputy mayor.

But just a few years later the brands were back. Factories in China proved susceptible to counterfeiters. When design specifications or materials were leaked, copycat producers could flood the market with knockoffs.

Inside the workshops

Throughout Ubrique, the tap tap of the patacabra rings out from behind workshop walls.

At many of the town’s factories, workers arrive before dawn, stow their phones in lockers and wait for a 6.55 a.m. alarm. When it sounds, they head to their benches and work—mostly on their feet—until 3 p.m., broken only by a 20-minute break.

Luxury brands often promote the image of a single in-house artisan meticulously crafting a handbag from start to finish. In reality, production is more industrial, broken down into a series of repetitive, specialized tasks that require less training—in theory making it easier to shift manufacturing elsewhere.

Yet making luxury leather goods still involves a sequence of precise, hands-on steps that require a high level of skill. Leather must be inspected and cut, then thinned, reinforced, stitched and assembled—often using techniques that machines can’t easily replicate. Edges are finished by hand and hardware is carefully fitted.

More experienced workers are assigned to the most technically demanding tasks. At one factory, employees said men’s backpacks were the hardest to make—not just because of the number of components, but also the precision needed to fit the panels, handles and zips.

“Finding qualified people is tough," said Manuel Fernández, owner of the Don Puro workshop, which supplies several luxury brands. “Out of every three new hires, you might only keep one. The others just don’t work out."

While businesspeople in Ubrique say they’re yet to feel the impact of Trump’s tariffs, the uncertainty is leading to heightened concerns in the town.

A broad luxury slowdown has already hit Ubrique’s producers. While much of the slack has been taken up by Polène, a fast-growing French brand that makes all of its handbags in the town, some workshops are feeling the pain as clients cut back on orders.

Marcos Obando, who works for a local employers’ association, is hopeful big luxury brands will keep investing in Ubrique, even if tariffs do add to costs. He argues the town should double down on quality, since it can’t compete on price—not even with lower-cost neighbors like Portugal or countries in Eastern Europe.

“There is a reason why all the brands have been working here for decades—why this town has been focused on this for many, many years," he said.

Buried in the DNA of the long extinct woolly mammoth is a compound that scientists hope will one day yield a lifesaving antibiotic.

In experiments, mammuthusin, as the compound is called, has eradicated superbugs—bacteria that are resistant to today’s antibiotics and cause infections that are hard to treat—says César de la Fuente, the bioengineer who helped discover the molecule.

De la Fuente, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, is among a group of scientists probing ancient and unlikely places—from genetic remnants of Neanderthals and extinct animals to unassuming backyard dirt—to find new antibiotics. He says the search is desperate: “Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest challenges we face as a society."

Infections caused by superbugs contribute to the deaths of more than five million people globally each year, and that toll is growing. Antibiotics are increasingly losing potency against even common infections. Without new drugs, antibiotic resistance could kill some 39 million people by 2050, a study last year predicted.

Now, fresh approaches to research are coming to an industry that has been slow to make new drugs and has been stymied by bacteria’s ability to rapidly evolve defenses against those that exist. Most of the antibiotics we use today, and that have saved hundreds of millions of lives, were found in nature—many of them decades ago and several by accident. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 after returning from vacation and finding that mold on a petri dish had prevented harmful bacteria from growing.

To help combat superbugs, doctors say we need new antibiotics with novel chemical structures or mechanisms of action. But only a handful of such drugs has entered the market over the past several decades.

De la Fuente is banking on artificial intelligence to help end this dry spell. He and his collaborators have built deep-learning algorithms to comb through enormous genetic databases to find peptides, or protein fragments, that have antibacterial properties. They have used this method to analyze animal venoms, the human microbiome and archaea, an underexplored group of microorganisms. They have also mined the genetic codes from fossils of long-extinct animals and humans, including Neanderthals and Denisovans. “This deep-learning model has opened a window into the past," de la Fuente says.

Most antibiotics used today are small-molecule drugs, mostly derived from bacteria and fungi. Small molecules can usually penetrate cell membranes with ease and are commonly administered as pills. Peptides, made up of short chains of amino acids, are larger and more complex. They tend to be more unstable in the body and can’t easily be made into pills.

But advances have been made in recent years to improve the ability of peptide drugs—which include some IV antibiotics, GLP-1s and insulin—to be absorbed and used by the body. Antibacterial peptides are also plentiful in nature, as they are a part of the immune system in most organisms.

“Peptides are the next big thing in medicine," says de la Fuente, who launched a startup in January to further explore the antibiotic potential of mammuthusin and other peptides.

When the algorithms identify a new peptide with antibiotic potential, de la Fuente and his team use robots to manufacture the compound in their lab and then test it in mice infected with bacteria. So far, a few hundred peptides made in de la Fuente’s lab have safely and effectively cured sick mice.

One of them was mammuthusin, identified in the genetic code of Mammuthus primigenius, a species of mammoth that last roamed the Earth about 4,000 years ago. The researchers discovered the peptide after mining a National Center for Biotechnology Information database of DNA sequencing data obtained from the fossils of extinct animals. In experiments, mammuthusin was as potent as polymyxin B, an antibiotic often used as a last resort for serious infections, according to a paper published in the journal Nature in June. The mammoth peptide effectively eradicated a type of bacterium that the World Health Organization has designated a critical pathogen because of its resistance to many common antibiotics.

The work with extinct species is “expanding the chemical space that we could explore," says James Collins, a bioengineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “These are molecules that evolved in a different time and a different setting."

Collins’s lab has built its own algorithms to trawl chemical databases, such as those of existing pharmaceutical drugs, for potential antibacterial compounds. His lab is also experimenting with using generative AI to design completely new molecules that could kill bacteria. Collins and colleagues said in a 2024 paper that they had identified structurally unique antibiotics after analyzing more than 12 million chemical compounds.

Modern scientific techniques could uncover new opportunities in old hunting grounds, says Gerry Wright, a biochemist at McMaster University in Canada. “The way people found antibiotics in the past was they would go out and get something in the dirt," he says, referring to the fungi and bacteria that most antibiotics are derived from. Microbes have been waging war against one another for eons and have developed excellent defenses against one another. “There haven’t been any compounds better than those made in nature," Wright says.

By the 1990s, however, scientists who were probing natural environments for antibiotics hit a wall: They kept finding the same antibiotic compounds again and again. “People got frustrated," Wright says. “It led to the misunderstanding that there was nothing more to find in these organisms."

But by using genetic sequencing and chromatography, a technique to separate mixtures, researchers in Wright’s lab have been able to analyze known microbes and find less-obvious antibacterial molecules that were previously missed.

Patience has also proved fruitful. A researcher in Wright’s lab took soil from a backyard in Ontario and extracted liquid from it that she kept in a petri dish under her bench for an entire year. Instead of adding nutrients to the dish and checking for organisms that grew quickly—long typical for antibiotic-hunting—she starved them and waited for rarer organisms to appear.

One of these slow-growing species was found to pump out a common antibiotic—but more detailed analysis showed that it also produced a previously unknown antibacterial peptide. That peptide, which would be considered a structurally novel antibiotic, eradicated drug-resistant bacteria in mice, according to a March paper published in Nature.

“We are going back with different eyes and different techniques and discovering that there’s still a lot of wealth to be found," Wright says.

Some consumers are taking smaller than standard doses of GLP-1s—the popular class of weight-loss and diabetes drugs that include Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound—or spacing out doses longer than indicated.

The reason: to save on money or lessen side effects. Some people say they can lose or maintain weight on such tiny doses and others believe the microdoses can help with other health-related factors.

The truth: This may be more of a social-media phenomenon than a reality. Doctors say yes, some people are super responders to the drugs and can lose or maintain weight loss at low doses—but it’s unusual to lose all your weight with these.

The majority of people microdosing will need to escalate their dose, which can be done more slowly for those with bad side effects, notably gastrointestinal issues.

Still, people are trying microdosing. Here’s what to know about it.

Pen vs. syringe

The first challenge with microdosing is the method of delivery. The prescription drugs entail taking weekly self-injections with pens.

Currently, most people taking alternative doses of GLP-1 drugs are using cheaper compounded versions of the medications, says Dr. Katherine H. Saunders, a clinical assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-founder of FlyteHealth, a medical obesity-treatment company. (Saunders, like many doctors, doesn’t recommend compounded copies of the drugs because of potential safety issues; the federal government has cracked down on the compounded market).

The only weekly GLP-1 drug that makes it easy to take alternative doses is Ozempic. It comes in a self-injectable pen where doses are administered with clicks. The other drugs have mostly been sold as single-dose injectable pens. But some patients will stretch out doses taking them every 10 days to two weeks. And once used the pens have a shelf life of 56 days.

Zepbound single-dose vials became available in the U.S. last year for self-pay customers only. This makes it theoretically possible to microdose by drawing out smaller amounts of liquid with a syringe.

But the single-use vials are free of preservatives. So using them after the rubber stopper is punctured increases risk of infection, says Anne Kome, a clinical pharmacist at University of North Carolina Health in Chapel Hill.

Saunders says many people taking fractional doses likely don’t meet the criteria for the drugs and are trying to lose a little weight or are hoping for potential longevity benefits.

Taking the edge off

They are people like Rachel Ratliff, a 56-year-old retired corporate lawyer in San Francisco. She was effortlessly skinny until she hit menopause and gained 10 pounds. Ratliff says she was always ravenous and nothing she did to take the weight off worked.

Ratliff decided to try a compounded version of tirzepatide—the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound and Mounjaro. “I started taking [tirzepatide] out of vanity but it’s completely changed my relationship to food and given me the ability to make healthier food choices," she says.

Initially she took the usual starting dose of 2.5 milligrams, which wiped her out. Then she tried a quarter dose. “It was amazing, it took the edge off my hunger," she says.

Ratliff says she lost 10 pounds in the first six weeks and continues to take a maintenance dose. This costs about $50 a month.

Saunders says some people are so-called “super responders" who are very sensitive to medications and may need lower than a standard dose. “We’re personalizing the dose, not microdosing them on purpose," she says.

Why they’re microdosing

Most people learn about microdosing from TikTok, according to a recent survey of 640 GLP-1 users conducted by Tebra, a health-software company.

Thirty-six percent of respondents said they microdose. Among them, 48% take smaller injections than prescribed and 43% split doses over a longer period. Sixty-six percent microdosed to reduce side effects; 40% wanted to ease into the medication; and 38% did it to save money.

Spokespeople for Novo Nordisk (Ozempic and Wegovy) and Eli Lilly (Mounjaro and Zepbound) said they don’t condone or encourage misuse of their products. They said microdosing poses potential safety risks.

Doctors agree that patients shouldn’t be choosing to microdose on their own.

“What about a patient microdosing on their cancer therapeutic or how about microdosing on their blood pressure medication based on how they feel? Or how about their insulin?" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “We have a disease here—not cosmetics."

Patients who try to conserve medicine by spreading out their doses may experience worse side effects, such as nausea and gastrointestinal issues, says Dr. Gitanjali Srivastava, a professor and co-director at the Vanderbilt Weight Loss Center.

“The body is not exposed to that medication for longer periods of time so they are less tolerable," she says. Taking doses that aren’t standard can also lead to more dosing errors.

Beyond weight loss

One promising area of microdosing may be health benefits independent of weight loss, researchers say.

Data published at the European Congress on Obesity conference last year found that people who took semaglutide—sold under the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy—and didn’t lose much weight had the same 20% reduction in heart attacks and strokes as those who took it and did lose weight, says Dr. Daniel Drucker, an endocrinologist and professor at University of Toronto who studies GLP-1 drugs.

“And so then the question is, if it doesn’t matter whether or not you lose weight, does it matter how much semaglutide you actually took to get that benefit?" he says.

We don’t know the answer, he says, because trials use standard doses of the drugs.

“I think what we’re starting to see is that there are clearly weight loss and glucose independent benefits of these medicines," says Drucker. “But what we don’t have is data saying ‘and you can achieve those benefits with microdosing.’"

When President Trump paused his tariff fight against Beijing this month, prominent voices in China praised their leader Xi Jinping as having fended off American pressure with resilience and resolution.

Beijing had taken a tough stance toward Trump’s tariffs, retaliating with economic countermeasures and vowing to “never kneel down" before foreign bullies. This defiance burnished Xi’s self-styled image as a leader with absolute authority, one imbued with the fortitude and spirit of sacrifice needed to guide China’s resurgence as a great power.

These qualities, some historians say, have roots in Xi’s formative years as a son of the revolutionary hero Xi Zhongxun, whose harsh parenting and unwavering loyalty to the Communist Party—throughout a tumultuous career rocked by years of persecution—seem to have inspired Xi Jinping to show the toughness his father demanded.

Party lore celebrates the elder Xi as a stoic figure who fought bravely for the Communist revolution and stayed true to the cause despite being wrongfully purged under Mao.

“While some may wonder why Jinping would remain so devoted to an organization that severely persecuted his own father, perhaps the better question is, How could Jinping betray the party for which his father sacrificed so much?" historian Joseph Torigian writes in the first English-language biography of Xi Zhongxun, which offers fresh vignettes and insights into the father’s influence on the Chinese leader.

Many within the party elite misread Xi Jinping when he took power in 2012, expressing expectations that he would emulate his father’s reputation as a reformer who helped open up China’s economy and managed religious and ethnic minorities with a softer touch. Instead Xi used iron-fisted tactics to centralize power, squelch dissent and tighten party control over the economy and society.

Xi’s hard-line approach belies a deeper degree of continuity with his father, whose “absolute devotion" to the Communist Party may have inspired his son’s own commitment to it and its long-term rule, Torigian argues in “The Party’s Interests Come First."

Xi Zhongxun joined the Communist Party as a teenager in 1928 and won Mao’s trust as a revolutionary fighter. After the Communist victory in 1949, he took on roles as a regional leader, propaganda minister and vice premier, but was purged in 1962 for alleged “anti-party" activities.

Stunned by his downfall, the elder Xi told a friend that he felt like “a person who fell off an eighteen-floor building," according to the biography.

He was sent away from Beijing to work in a factory and separated from his family. During Mao’s 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution, which began as Xi Jinping entered his teens, militant Red Guards abused Xi Zhongxun at public-shaming rallies and, according to party accounts which don’t offer details, “persecuted" one of his daughters to death.

But Xi Zhongxun “never abandoned his emotional attachment to Mao," writes Torigian, who describes how the patriarch—while still in political disgrace—made Xi Jinping memorize some of Mao’s speeches. During a brief reunion in 1976, the father watched his son recite the speeches by heart while they both sat in their underwear, according to the book.

“Although the party betrayed Xi Zhongxun, Xi Zhongxun never betrayed the party," Torigian writes.

The elder Xi was rehabilitated after Mao’s death in 1976, serving as a provincial chief, a member of the party’s elite Politburo and a senior lawmaker before being sidelined after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. A father of four daughters and three sons across two marriages, the patriarch died in 2002 at the age of 88. Xi Jinping is the elder of the two sons he had with his second wife, Qi Xin.

Historians and people who knew Xi Zhongxun say he molded his son’s character by imposing brutal discipline at home—including strict rules on frugality enforced with physical beatings—and by recounting tales of his revolutionary exploits. During the Mao era, Xi Jinping often faced persecution as a child of a disgraced official—experiences he later credited for hardening his character and schooling him on the vagaries of power.

Xi Jinping “does seem to have learned quite a bit from his father about the nature and dynamics of Chinese politics, which even insiders struggle to navigate successfully—including Xi’s own father," said Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution and a former director for China on President Joe Biden’s National Security Council.

Xi Jinping showed reverence for his father, publicly and privately. Torigian recounts how the son would kowtow to his father at Lunar New Year gatherings, wait for the patriarch’s go-ahead before taking his seat, and on one occasion even finished a piece of food that his father had started eating but found too difficult to chew.

“The ways in which Xi has gone out of his way to almost perform respect and obedience to his father…is striking," said Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King’s College London, who has written books on Xi.

“Xi [Zhongxun] respected toughness—Jinping was his favorite son precisely because of a belief that Jinping had the most ‘mettle,’" writes Torigian.

Xi Jinping has sought to demonstrate that mettle as China’s leader. He has pursued a more assertive style of diplomacy to advance Beijing’s interests and called on the Chinese people to show grit in adversity such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the current trade war with the U.S.

The younger Xi’s forcefulness in cleansing corruption and disloyalty within the party echoes his father’s approach. Notwithstanding his reputation as being relatively liberal, Xi Zhongxun was zealous in implementing Mao’s brutal purges, according to Torigian.

During the 1942-1945 Yan’an rectification drive, a purge that Mao launched to consolidate power, Xi Zhongxun directed an “aggressive hunt for spies" that led to many wrongful persecutions, according to the book. Suspects often made false confessions to avoid torture, sometimes while Xi watched. Entire classes of school children were denounced as enemy agents, Torigian writes.

In the early 1950s, as a senior official overseeing northwestern China, Xi fervently enforced a Mao campaign to hunt counterrevolutionaries, saying that “it is necessary to remember that the more bad people whom we kill, the more they will be afraid."

“Studying his father enables us to understand how Xi [Jinping] would have gained a view on how vicious elite-level politics in China was, and what would need to be done to stay in power," said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London and co-author of a book on Xi’s political ideas.

Why did the Indian stock market fall today? Experts pointed out these five key reasons behind the fall in the Indian stock market today:

1. Concerns over piling US debt US President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill has raised fears that it will increase the US debt and further slow US economic growth.

"Trump's tax bill is expected to be voted on this week in Congress, and investors are worried it could add about $3.8 trillion to the $36 trillion US debt pile," reported Reuters.

According to VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, the fundamental issue is the US's high fiscal deficit, which the market feels is unsustainable.

"The weak US 20-year bond auction and the spike in yields of 5-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds indicate the declining confidence in US bonds," said Vijayakumar.

2. Escalating tensions in the Middle East Reports of rising tensions between Iran and Israel also seem to have hit the risk appetite of investors.

CNN reported that the US has gathered new intelligence, suggesting that Israel is preparing for a potential military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities.

Meanwhile, Reuters reported that "Oman's foreign minister said a fresh round of nuclear talks between Iran and the US would take place later this week."

3. Lack of fresh positive triggers Experts say the domestic market lacks fresh triggers to give a breakout. The domestic market has been rangebound as investors seek clarity on the US-India trade negotiations. The market seems to have fairly discounted economic growth in the short term and earnings revival from Q1FY26.

Experts say macroeconomic prints and earnings growth will be the key factors that will determine market direction going ahead.

Brokerage firm Kotak Securities pointed out that India's good macro and mediocre micro could go either way.

"Many high-frequency indicators have seen steady weakness in recent months. Earnings outlook has deteriorated across market caps and sectors, as seen in the steady cuts in consensus earnings," said Kotak.

4. Stretched valuations The recent rally in Indian markets has stretched the valuations of large-caps, while mid- and small-caps are trading at lofty valuations. This has raised concerns that the market may see some deep correction in the near term.

"The market is again in the grips of irrational exuberance, with the market quick to discount any half-baked narrative (defence being the latest one). The market’s recurring tendency to buy into narratives is astonishing given the history of narratives. Many had emerged and collapsed in the past two to three years,' said Kotak.

5. Mixed Q4 earnings fail to boost the market Mixed Q4 earnings have failed to give a boost to market sentiment. Kotak Securities pointed out that Q4FY25 earnings season has been broadly muted, with Nifty-50 net profits growing 7.5 per cent year-on-year.

"Most large sectors saw a varying mix of growth and profitability challenges coupled with a dim outlook, with consumer companies reporting weak volume growth, margin headwinds and muted demand commentary, investment companies reporting margin challenges, banks reporting weak credit growth, and IT services companies indicating weak demand," said Kotak.

Borana Weaves IPO review Giving a 'subscribe' tag to the public issue, Gaurav Goel, Founder & Director at Fynocrat Technologies, said, "Borana Weaves offers a compelling growth story in the synthetic textile sector. The company can scale profitably with a vertically integrated model, high-capacity utilization, and efficient water jet loom technology investment. While the IPO is priced fairly based on future earnings (with an estimated P/E of 14.7x for FY25), meaning it's not cheap, the company's strong fundamentals and positive industry trends support a favourable long-term outlook. Investors with a long-term horizon may consider subscribing to this IPO."

INDSEC Securities has also assigned a 'subscribe' tag to the book build issue: "At an upper price band of ₹216, Borana Weaves is valued at a PE of 24.4x on FY24 earnings vs Industry peer set average PE of 35x. The company manufactures specialized synthetic grey fabric and polyester-textured yarn. The demand for polyester in India is projected to grow from 4 Mnt to 6.7 Mnt by 2025. Also, the global end-use market for artificial fibres will expand by 3.7% by 2025. Over FY22-24, the company's Revenue/EBITDA/APAT has registered a CAGR of 116.8%/182.1%/262.1%, respectively. Within 9M of FY25, revenue has already surpassed FY24 reported revenue, owing to scale in capacity utilisation of unit 3, which got commercialised in Q4 FY24. Through IPO proceeds, the company intends to set up a new manufacturing unit to reach a 346 million meters per annum capacity and continue capitalising on the growing demand for synthetic fabric. Additionally, foraying into producing high-margin technical textiles is expected to improve business margins further. In FY24, the company's ROE and ROCE were at 49.5% and 24.3%, respectively. We have a "Subscribe" rating for the IPO on account of strong industry growth tailwinds, higher capacity utilisation (>75%) in the existing facility, coupled with the new facility and diversifying into high-margin products."

Should you apply for the Belrise Industries IPO? Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk believes that Belrise Industries IPO presents a compelling opportunity, backed by strong fundamentals and a leadership position in the automotive components space.

“The company’s strategic focus on EV components, combined with its extensive OEM partnerships and integrated manufacturing, positions it well for sustained growth. The substantial debt repayment through IPO proceeds is expected to enhance profitability and improve cash flows, offering valuation comfort at a forward P/E of 16x. While investor attention is warranted on related-party transactions and customer concentration, the long-term growth potential and diversification into future-ready segments make Belrise an attractive bet for medium- to long-term investors,” Garg said.

Belrise Industries is an automotive component manufacturing company based in India offering a diverse range of safety critical systems and other engineering solutions for 2W, 3W, 4W, commercial vehicles and agri-vehicles. The company is one of the top three companies with a market share of 24% in the overall two-wheeler metal components segment in India as of March 31, 2024, in terms of revenue. Driven by rising product sales and increasing international presence, BIL has demonstrated strong growth in revenue.

Analysts at Geojit Investments Ltd noted that the upper price band of ₹90, Belrise Industries IPO is available at a P/E ratio of 25.8x (FY24 EPS), which appears to be reasonably priced compared to its long term profitability and PAT margin expansion owing to improvement in financial metrics.

“Given its dominant market share, diversified product portfolio, strong presence in EV& IC engine segments, capacity expansions, optimize inventory management and favourable industry outlook, we recommend a ‘Subscribe’ rating for a long-term basis,” Geojit Investments said.

According to Choice Broking, at the higher price band, Belrise Industries is demanding a TTM P/E multiple of 29.5x and EV/Sales of 1.1x, which is at discount to the peer average.

“While the company has demonstrated growth in both revenue and net profit, its margins have come under pressure. To address this, Belrise Industries is focused on increasing its content per vehicle, which is expected to enhance profitability. Additionally, the planned debt repayment is likely to contribute further to margin improvement. The company’s recent acquisition is expected to enhance its product offerings and drive sales growth, contributing positively to its overall business performance,” said Choice Broking.

Thus, the brokerage firm recommends a ‘Subscribe’ rating for the Belrise Industries IPO.

The government has ratified the rate of interest on employees' provident fund at 8.25 per cent for FY25, enabling the retirement fund body EPFO to deposit the annual interest accumulation in the post-retirement funds of over seven crore subscribers.

EPFO, on February 28, had decided to retain the interest rate of 8.25 per cent on employees' provident fund (EPF) deposits for the financial year 2024-25, equal to the rate provided in the preceding fiscal. The approved rate of interest for 2024-25 was sent for concurrence of the Ministry of Finance.

"Ministry of Finance has given concurrence to 8.25 per cent rate of interest on the EPF for 2024-25 fiscal year and labour ministry sent a communication regarding this to the EPFO on Thursday," a labour ministry official told news agency PTI. Now the interest amount as per the rate ratified for FY25 will be credited into the accounts of over seven crore subscribers of EPFO.

The decision on interest rate was taken at the 237th meeting of the central board of trustees of the EPFO chaired by Union Minister for Labour & Employment Mansukh Mandaviya in New Delhi on February 28. Compared to many fixed-income instruments, EPF offers relatively higher and stable returns, ensuring steady growth on post-retirement savings.

EPFO meetings' key decisions today Following the official ratification, the EPFO will credit the rate of interest into the subscribers' accounts. Compared to many other fixed-income instruments, the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) offers relatively high and stable returns, ensuring steady savings growth.

The interest earned on EPF deposits is tax-free (up to a specified limit), making it an attractive investment option for salaried individuals. Following the actuarial valuation of the Employees' Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme, the Board approved key modifications to the scheme to provide greater financial security and support to members' families.

A minimum life insurance benefit of ₹50,000 will be provided in cases where an EPF member dies without completing one year of continuous service. This amendment is expected to result in higher benefits for more than 5,000 cases of deaths in service every year.

Under the revised EDLI Scheme, if a member passes away within six months of their last contribution received, the EDLI benefit will be admissible, provided the member's name is not struck off from the rolls. Under the modifications, a gap of up to two months between two spells of employment will be considered as continuous service, ensuring eligibility for higher quantum EDLI benefits.

EPFO interest rate changes In February 2024, the EPFO had increased the interest rate marginally to 8.25 per cent for 2023-24, from 8.15 per cent in 2022-23. In March 2022, EPFO had lowered the interest on EPF for 2021-22 to an over four-decade low of 8.1 per cent, from 8.5 per cent in 2020-21. The 8.10 per cent rate of interest on EPF for 2020-21 was the lowest since 1977-78, when it stood at 8 per cent.

EPFO adds 1.46 million members in March EPFO, which manages retirement savings for salaried employees, reported a net addition of 1.46 million subscribers in March, with just over half being first-time enrollees, according to an official statement on Wednesday.

I have bought a residential property with my wife by taking a joint home loan. I am the only one repaying the loan. We have let out this house. The rental agreement is made in the name of my wife, and the rent is credited to my wife’s bank account. We stay in a rented house, paying ₹15,000 per month. How can I save income tax in this situation?

I am a salaried employee and receive HRA from my employer. It is apparent that the down payment of the house was funded by you, and the EMIs are also being paid by you alone, and therefore, you alone are the beneficial owner of the property.

So the rental agreement and income should have been taken into your bank account, logically. The rental income cannot be taken into her account just because her name is added as a joint owner in the sale agreement. This is patently wrong and not as per the law. Ensure that the rental income is included in your ITR for F.Y. 24-25 and take the rental income into your bank account henceforth.

Against the rental income, you will get a standard deduction of 30% in addition to the interest payment being made for the home loan.

Old Tax Regime vs New Tax Regime Effect If you opt for the old tax regime, you can claim full interest against rental income, but loss under the house property head is allowed to be set off against other heads of income up to ₹2 lakhs every year, and the unabsorbed loss shall be carried forward for set off in eight subsequent years.

If you opt for the new tax regime, you can claim interest paid on a home loan only to the extent of taxable rent, as the loss under the house property head is not allowed to be set off against other income under the new tax regime. The excess interest can neither be set off during the current year nor can it be carried forward to subsequent years for set off.

As far as availing the benefits in respect of HRA is concerned, this is available only if you opt for the old tax regime. You can claim HRA benefits if you are paying rent for a property which is occupied by you and is not owned by you, even if you own any other house.

Also Read | Opting for old tax regime? You can claim HRA exemption subject to certain limits

Amount of HRA exemption available The amount of HRA exemption available at a minimum is as per the following points:

50% of your basic salary received will be HRA if you are staying in a metro city, else it is 40%. Excess of rent paid over 10% of the basic salary Amount of actual HRA received. Without details of your HRA and basic salary, I can not specify the exact amount of HRA exemption available to you.

Heavy rain accompanied by gusty winds and thunderstorms lashed Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) early Sunday, bringing the city to a standstill. The downpour caused significant traffic disruptions, waterlogging, and flight delays. A police officer died after the roof of the Assistant Commissioner's office collapsed during the torrential rain.

More than 200 flights were affected due to a strong storm and heavy downpour at Indira Gandhi International Airport. Around 49 flights were diverted between 11:30 pm on Saturday to 4:00 am on Sunday, the airport authority said on Sunday.

Amid an apparent rise in new Covid19 infections across several cities, India has detected cases of two new variants, according to fresh data from the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (Insacog), a central government agency.

These variants are named -- NB.1.8.1 and LF.7.

One case of NB.1.8.1 was identified in Tamil Nadu in April, and four cases of the LF.7 variant were reported in Gujarat in May.

As of now, the World Health Organisation (WHO) classifies both LF.7 and NB.1.8 as Variants Under Monitoring, and not under Variants of Concern or Variants of Interest.

However, these variants are reportedly contributing to a rise in Covid cases in China and parts of Asia.

In India, the dominant variant remains JN.1, accounting for 53 per cent of samples tested, followed by BA.2 (26 per cent) and other Omicron sublineages (20 per cent).

Though WHO assesses NB.1.8.1 as posing a low global public health risk, it carries spike protein mutations—A435S, V445H, and T478I—that may increase transmissibility and immune evasion compared to earlier variants.

As of May 19, India reported 257 active Covid cases. A review meeting chaired by the Director General of Health Services, with participation from experts at the National Centre for Disease Control, ICMR, and other health bodies, was recently held to assess the evolving situation.

Delhi recorded 23 new cases, Andhra Pradesh reported four in the last 24 hours, Telangana confirmed one, and a nine-month-old in Bengaluru tested positive amid a gradual rise over the past 20 days. Kerala reported 273 cases in May alone.

The latest deaths related to Covid include an 84-year-old patient with comorbidities in Bengaluru and a 21-year-old with diabetic ketoacidosis in Maharashtra.

CASES IN MAHARASHTRA

From January to date, Maharashtra has conducted 7,144 tests, resulting in 257 positive cases. In the past two days, 93 new infections were reported, with the highest cases in Mumbai.

Mumbai: 47

Pune: 30

Navi Mumbai: 7

Thane: 3

Nagpur: 6

The state currently has 166 active Covid patients.

Since January, Mumbai has recorded 213 cases, with a sharp rise noted in May (207 cases). Most patients are experiencing mild symptoms.

Maharashtra has reported four Covid-related deaths this year and all of them were suffering from other serious diseases.

The latest death was of a 21-year-old male with diabetic ketoacidosis who tested positive and died at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Thane, according to hospital dean Dr Aniruddh Malgaonkar.

Previous deaths involved patients with nephrotic syndrome, cancer, and cerebrovascular disease.

CASES IN KARNATAKA

Five new COVID-19 cases were reported on Saturday. Bengaluru accounts for 32 of the state's 38 active cases.

An 84-year-old patient with comorbidities died at Aster Hospital, Whitefield, after testing positive on May 17.

The Union Health Secretary, on Saturday, reviewed the national situation. Cases have mainly been reported from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. Most cases are mild and under home care, the ministry said.

Commenting on the April 22 Pahalgam attack, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who is leading a parliamentary delegation under Operation Sindoor outreach, said that he doesn't work for the government during an interaction at the Indian Consulate in New York.

He praised India's strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir terror camps and said India "hit hard and smart".

Tharoor said, "I don't work for the government, as you know. I work for an opposition party. I myself authored an op-ed saying the time has come to hit hard but hit smart. I'm pleased to say that's exactly what India did."

advertisement

He added that India, on May 7, carried out "very precise and calibrated strikes", targeting "nine specific known terrorist bases, headquarters, and launchpads" in Pakistan and PoK.

Tharoor also said that the time had come to set a "new bottom line" in India's dealings with Pakistan. "We have tried everything - international dossiers, complaints, everything has been tried," he added.

He said that Pakistan had remained in denial, with "no convictions, no serious criminal prosecutions, and no genuine attempt to dismantle" its terror infrastructure. "The persistence of safe havens...you (Pakistan) do this, you are going to get this back," he added.

Referring to India's recent response under Operation Sindoor, Tharoor said the country had now demonstrated its ability to strike with "a degree of precision". He clarified, however, that India did not seek war with Pakistan. "We are not interested in warfare," he said. "We would much rather be left alone to grow our economy and pull our people into the world they are getting ready for in the 21st century," Tharoor added.

Tharoor pointed out that while India remained a status quo power, Pakistan did not. He said Pakistan continued to covet Indian territory and was willing to pursue its objectives through terrorism when conventional means failed. "They are willing to get it through terrorism, and that is not acceptable," the Congress MP said.

Shashi Tharoor's delegation will visit five countries, including the United States, Panama, Guyana, Brazil and Colombia. The delegation also includes BJP MPs Tejasvi Surya, Bhubaneswar Kalita and Shashank Mani Tripathi, LJP (Ram Vilas)'s Shambhavi Choudhary, TDP's GM Harish Balayogi, Shiv Sena’s Milind Deora, JMM’s Sarfaraz Ahmad, and former Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu.

United States President Donald Trump doubled down on his attack on Harvard University while defending his administration's move to block its ability to enrol international students.

Trump, in a post on Truth Social, claimed almost 31 per cent of students studying at Harvard are from foreign countries and the university administration is not forthcoming with details on these students despite repeated requests from his administration.

advertisement

His fresh attack comes after a judge suspended his administration's action.

"Why isn’t Harvard saying that almost 31% of their students are from FOREIGN LANDS, and yet those countries, some not at all friendly to the United States, pay NOTHING toward their student’s education, nor do they ever intend to. Nobody told us that!", he wrote.

Trump added, "We want to know who those foreign students are, a reasonable request since we give Harvard BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, but Harvard isn’t exactly forthcoming. We want those names and countries. Harvard has $52,000,000, use it, and stop asking for the Federal Government to continue GRANTING money to you!"

On Friday, a US judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enrol foreign students, a move that ratcheted up White House efforts to conform practices in academia to President Donald Trump's policies.

advertisement

In a complaint filed in Boston federal court earlier on Friday, Harvard called the revocation a "blatant violation" of the US Constitution and other federal laws, and had an "immediate and devastating effect" on the university and more than 7,000 visa holders.

"With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the university and its mission," Harvard said.

Earlier, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem informed Harvard that its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification was “revoked effective immediately.”

“I am writing to inform you that, effective immediately, Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked,” the letter read.

In a social media post she blamed Harvard for, "holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus."

The university filed a lawsuit last month against the administration over attempts to alter its curriculum, admissions procedures, and hiring policies.

A day-long conclave of National Democratic Alliance (NDA) chief ministers and deputy chief ministers has begun in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several senior Union ministers attending the event.

Around 20 Chief Ministers and 18 Deputy Chief Ministers from NDA-ruled states are present at the meeting. Senior BJP leaders, including party president JP Nadda, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and Home Minister Amit Shah, have also arrived for the meeting, being held at the Ashoka hotel in the national capital.

Earlier, on Sunday morning, chief ministers from various states reached the venue, including Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio.

So far, at the meeting, a resolution has been passed praising the valour of the armed forces and the decisive leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The resolution was proposed by Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra Deputy CM Eknath Shinde, sources said.

Several chief ministers have also presented key welfare and development schemes from their respective states during the session. The meeting has also paid homage to the victims of the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, offering tributes to those who lost their lives.

Organised by the BJP, the meeting will also likely focus on key issues including Operation Sindoor, the upcoming caste enumeration in the next census, the first anniversary of the PM Modi government's third term and good governance practices.

Eknath Shinde, while speaking at the meeting, praised PM Modi and Operation Sindoor. He said that the NDA has proven that the phrase "those who clash with us will be destroyed" is not just a saying but a reality.

He added that Operation Sindoor has instilled a renewed sense of self-confidence and pride in ordinary Indians. "We salute the Centre's policies, the bravery of our armed forces, and the courage of Prime Minister Narendra Modi," Shinde said.

Referring to PM Modi's recent statement, "PM Modi doesn’t have blood in his veins, but hot sindoor," Shinde said, "The 140 crore people of this country are proud of you. It is the good fortune of every citizen that we have a courageous, valiant, and selfless patriot like you as our Prime Minister."

"Operation Sindoor will go down in history as a strong response to those who attempted to derail India’s peaceful development journey," Shinde said. He added that the operation reflects the NDA government's unwavering commitment to India’s sovereignty and the safety of its citizens.

BJP leader Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, who heads the party’s good governance department, said that the conclave would pass resolutions congratulating the armed forces and PM Modi for the success of Operation Sindoor, and another lauding the Centre’s decision to carry out caste-based data collection in the next census.

"A significant part of the conclave will be devoted to sharing best practices from NDA-ruled states, with respective chief ministers presenting their governance initiatives," Sahasrabuddhe added.

Discussions will also cover upcoming milestones such as the first anniversary of Modi 3.0, the 10th International Yoga Day and the 50th anniversary of the Emergency.

16 March 2025. Nearly a month before the start of the Indian Premier League 2025, Shashank Singh said on a podcast that Punjab Kings would finish in the top two of the points table this season. Shubhankar Mishra, the seasoned journalist hosting the show, let out an audible laugh - unable to believe what Shashank had just predicted.

Undeterred, Shashank doubled down. Punjab, he insisted, had built a fresh squad under the tutelage of Ricky Ponting and would definitely race to the top two in 2025. Mishra, still sceptical, warned Shashank that if Punjab didn’t even qualify for the playoffs, he’d clip the interview and troll him.

Perennial underachievers, the Punjab Kings last qualified for the IPL playoffs in 2014. Under George Bailey’s leadership, they were an exciting outfit, with the likes of Virender Sehwag and Glenn Maxwell lighting up the scoring charts. But after losing the 2014 final to KKR, Punjab slipped into a prolonged slump - cycling through coaches and captains with alarming frequency.

advertisement

By the end of 2024, Punjab had become synonymous with instability and a lack of faith in their homegrown talent.

But something changed.

India Today spoke to two of Punjab Kings' coaches to understand what sparked this transformation. Brad Haddin (assistant coach) and James Hopes (bowling coach) shed light on the processes set in motion even before the auction - processes that gave this team an identity and helped them defy expectations to reach the playoffs. They also revealed how the onboarding of Shreyas Iyer and Ricky Ponting completely changed the culture of the franchise.

This is the Punjab Kings story.

FRESH START AT THE AUCTION

Since the introduction of the Impact Player rule in the IPL, the focus has shifted towards deploying specialists - pure batters or bowlers - over traditional all-rounders. The rule diminished the value of multi-dimensional players (except the elite few), as specialists could now be subbed in and out of the XI.

Punjab Kings had the biggest budget in the mega auction of 2024. With Rs 112 crore at their disposal, it was important for them to build a squad that would be free of the past baggage, a squad that could start fresh. In a period where the role of all-rounders is diminishing due to the Impact Player rule, Punjab Kings went against the grain and flooded their squad with all-rounders - nine, to be exact.





The wait for Playoffs qualification was long



The belief however, was persistent



Ahead of the #TATAIPL 2025 Playoffs, where will @PunjabKingsIPL rank in the battle of the four? #PBKSvDC pic.twitter.com/yQi6n9QHF0— IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) May 24, 2025

Out of those, three were used consistently throughout the tournament: Marcus Stoinis, Marco Jansen, and Azmatullah Omarzai, the highest among all the teams in IPL 2025.

According to James Hopes, the logic was simple: all-rounders gave the team a second chance if things went pear-shaped early in a game.

“What we’ve done is, by having all-rounders, we’re always able to strengthen what we do second - and still have something up our sleeve if the first hour goes wrong. That’s all we’re trying to do. Whatever we do second - bat or bowl - we want a stronger hand,” Hopes told India Today.

He elaborated on how this approach added depth and flexibility:

“With the all-rounders, we can pick all our bowling and still bat till No. 8. Azmatullah comes in at 8, Marco’s already in the top eight. Then it’s Arshdeep and Chahal. So if we’re six down early, we bring in another all-rounder who can bat us out of trouble. If our top six or seven deliver, we just bring in the spinner - Brar - and get 6–8 overs from two of our top 8. That’s great.”

While the all-rounders gave Punjab flexibility, they weren’t the only reason behind the team’s new identity. The core of Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shreyas Iyer, Shashank Singh, and Arshdeep Singh has been instrumental in getting them to 17 points from 13 games. They would have 4 points more, if not for the washed-out game against KKR at Eden Gardens, or the abandoned match vs Delhi Capitals in Dharamsala - where they were well ahead before the matches were called off.

“Sometimes in this tournament, it’s easy to think, ‘Oh, let’s bring overseas stars to dominate,’ but we’ve done the opposite,” Hopes explained. “We’ve used the overseas players for the ‘niggly’ roles - three overs, hit sixes at the end - and trusted our Indian talent to take on the key spots: opening, No. 3, finishing. Shanky at the end, Wadhera in the middle, Arshdeep as our lead pacer - we didn’t replace them. We built around them.”

THE SHREYAS IYER IMPACT

A large credit for Punjab's success has to go to the people that decided Shreyas Iyer should be the person to take the team forward. The onboarding of Shreyas had a big impact on the team's top order, both in terms of style and attitude.

In T20 cricket, teams that start strong with the bat often hold the upper hand. Over the past few seasons, Punjab’s template with either KL Rahul or Shikhar Dhawan at the top was increasingly outdated. The top order would look to hold the innings together, push for a score around 200–220, and hope the bowlers could defend it.

At the start of the 2025 season, new head coach Ricky Ponting was quite clear about how Punjab wanted to “shed the baggage of failure” and were ready to play bold, exciting cricket. Words like that read well on paper - but are difficult to live up to. Just ask SRH, who crumbled this year on more balanced tracks despite similar promises.

But in their very first match of IPL 2025, Punjab showed they weren’t bluffing. Young Priyansh Arya smashed 7 boundaries and 2 sixes in a 23-ball blitz. Captain Shreyas Iyer hit a boundary off his first ball and went on to score an unbeaten 97. He could’ve easily chased a century, but chose instead to let Shashank Singh face the final over, believing that the lower order specialist was better suited to finish the job.

That kind of selflessness hadn’t been seen at Punjab Kings before. The obvious question: where did it come from?

According to assistant coach Brad Haddin, it starts with Iyer’s character.

“Ricky came in with a really clear vision - he needed a strong leader. We made no secret of wanting Shreyas Iyer. He’s worked well with Ricky at Delhi Capitals, complements everything the staff stand for, and his cricket knowledge is second to none. But what really sets him apart is the care he shows - not just for the players, but for the coaches and staff too,” Haddin told India Today. Shreyas Iyer, Ricky Ponting (PTI Photo)

Iyer had endured a difficult 18 months before this season. After a brilliant ODI World Cup 2023, he was left out of the BCCI central contracts - reportedly for not toeing the management’s line.

The snub, which also cost him a place in the national team, must have left him wondering: What did I do wrong? But unlike his compatriot Ishan Kishan - who vanished from the scene - Iyer stayed the course.

He went back to domestic cricket, scored heavily, led Mumbai to trophies, and earned a national recall. In January 2025, he got a break due to an injury to Virat Kohli. He grabbed it with both hands, cemented his place, and starred in India’s triumphant Champions Trophy campaign.

The confidence from lifting an ICC trophy brought back his full range of strokes. After 13 games in IPL 2025, Iyer had scored 488 runs at a strike rate of 172.43 - his most impactful season ever.

“He’s been really clear with Ricky on the style we want to play, the habits we build at training, and the mindset we carry,” Haddin said. “You can look at a lot of moments, but the KKR game was special. The belief Shreyas had that we were in it - that belief spread to the team and even the crowd. That’s what he brings to the environment.”

PRABHSIMRAN AND THE SENSE OF SECURITY

It wasn’t just Shreyas Iyer who elevated Punjab’s game this season. The energy and clarity he and Ricky Ponting brought rubbed off on others too - especially the batters. Priyansh Arya and Prabhsimran Singh, two uncapped Indian talents, had a major impact at the top of the order.

Of the two, Prabhsimran is arguably the more curious case. At Punjab since 2019, he’s long been seen as a batter brimming with promise - known for the odd explosive knock, usually in the 30s or 40s, and occasionally something bigger. But this season, that promise has finally translated into consistency.

With 486 runs at a strike rate above 170, including four fifties in 13 matches, Prabhsimran has given Punjab exactly what they had hoped to get from one of their big-budget buys. Instead, it's been their homegrown player delivering match after match.

According to James Hopes, this breakthrough wasn’t accidental. It had everything to do with a one-on-one conversation with Ricky Ponting before the season began.

Ponting made two things clear: what he expected from Prabhsimran, and that he wouldn’t be dropped for failing - as long as he was trying to execute his role.

“Ricky talks to the batters a lot about how a game can change with just two scores - like an 80-plus and a 40-plus. The stat a few years back said you’d win 94% of games with that combo. So we told the batters: it’s okay to fail. We want you to play your way. If you get out, you won’t be dropped,” Hopes said.

“For Prabhsimran, the penny’s dropped. It happens - some players hit that moment. He’s always been skilled, but now he’s confident. And the best part is, he’s just being himself. Nobody asked him to bat differently. That’s what Rick does best - he gives them the freedom to be who they are.”

That same approach has worked wonders for Nehal Wadhera, too. Discarded by Mumbai Indians, Wadhera has thrived in Punjab’s system. More than just runs, he’s found his voice in the team.

“We trust Wadhera to read the situation,” Hopes explained. “Like in the game against Rajasthan, we were 40/3 at the timeout. And he goes, ‘We’ve got to get 180-plus.’ Most guys would be cautious, but he was like, ‘We’re still on track. Let’s go even harder.’ That kind of clarity - you can only speak that way when you feel secure in your role.” Parbhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya (PTI Photo)

The message from team leadership has been simple: don’t keep your thoughts internal. Speak up, back your ideas, and go execute.

“That’s what Rick and Shreyas have done really well,” Hopes added. “They’ve made it okay to think out loud - and act on it. And the players are doing just that.”

Don't get this wrong, but despite all the success of Ponting and the coaching staff, Punjab Kings haven’t had a flawless season. Big-name players have failed - none more so than Glenn Maxwell. Once the captain of this franchise, Maxwell was backed consistently in the lineup, yet from seven games, he returned just 48 runs and four wickets.

But here’s the difference: the team didn’t crumble under the weight of a superstar’s failure. They were insulated by a strong support system - by clarity in roles and belief in a squad filled with coachable, grounded players. Players willing to listen. Players willing to grow.

Names like Azmatullah Omarzai and Priyansh Arya might be young and fearless, but they’ve also been receptive - eager to absorb the wisdom of those around them.

“It was a whole new auction,” Brad Haddin said. “We had a really clear idea - not just about what kind of cricketers we wanted, but what kind of people. It wasn’t just about stacking up all-rounders. It was about personality.”

And personality, as it turns out, mattered.

“You need coachable players,” Haddin continued. “And that’s what we got with this group. They all bought into what Ricky and I brought in - and we’re seeing it translate on the field.”

In years past, Punjab often felt like a team of mismatched parts - chopped, changed, reshuffled. But in 2025, the pieces finally clicked. Not because they were all big names, but because they fit. Because they listened. Because they believed.

PUNJAB CRACK THE CODE

In 2025, Punjab Kings have done what once seemed impossible: they’ve cracked the IPL code. Not with big names or flashy signings - but through cohesion, clarity, and culture.

Their turning point? When Shreyas Iyer gave up a personal milestone - a maiden IPL hundred - to let Shashank Singh finish the job. That moment wasn’t just selfless. It was symbolic. It said everything about this team’s DNA.

Belief has been their superpower. In a season where others blinked, Punjab held their nerve - none more so than when they defended 111 against KKR. That grit, that trust in one another, has been their biggest win.

This isn’t the old Punjab anymore. This is a team with a spine, with swagger, and with something to prove.

And if they do go all the way - if they lift that trophy - Shashank Singh won’t need to say a word. That clip will speak for itself.

Chennai Super Kings are anchored firmly at the bottom of the table, certain to finish last for the first time in their Indian Premier League history. They have been at their poorest throughout the season. Yet, the buzz surrounding CSK's matches remains undiminished, with packed stands across India, all thanks to MS Dhoni.

Yes, Dhoni is no longer the man who used to effortlessly deposit sixes into the stands. He may not even be the same captain with the 'Midas touch'. Yet, Dhoni, through his sheer presence, continues to draw crowds and captivate attention.

When he arrived in Chennai for the pre-season camp in February wearing a customised T-shirt emblazoned with 'One Last Time' in Morse Code, many believed IPL 2025 would indeed be his final season.

However, with things going awry for both the Super Kings and their Thala, it remains uncertain whether Sunday's game in Ahmedabad will be Dhoni's swansong.' Incidentally, it is also the venue where CSK clinched their fifth IPL title two years ago - a match many felt should have been Dhoni's farewell to the IPL.

Ever since CSK were knocked out of the playoff race this season, the question has relentlessly followed Dhoni and those representing the Super Kings at press conferences.

Dhoni himself has addressed it on a couple of occasions. When asked by Danny Morrison at the toss, Dhoni tactfully dodged the question. On another occasion, he was more candid, stating he was in no rush to decide and would wait to see how his body held up over the next ten months before making any calls about his IPL future.

Dhoni's brand value remains untarnished. However, his on-field ability is clearly declining. With the bat, Dhoni has been more of a burden this year - scoring 196 runs in 13 matches at a strike rate of 135, a significant drop from his staggering strike rate of 220 in 2024. Despite undergoing surgery, his troublesome knee has been a persistent concern throughout the season.

Dhoni has rarely overstayed his welcome. Yet, it now seems his presence in the playing XI might be hindering the Super Kings. On numerous occasions this season,' Dhoni has struggled to produce the typical late-game bursts that once defined him.

Still, the CSK camp firmly believes Dhoni will know best when to call time on his IPL career. It would be a miracle if he returns for IPL 2026 and delivers better performances, especially with the bat.

As CSK prepare to close their forgettable season against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Sunday, one thing seems almost certain: we may well be witnessing the last of 'Captain' Dhoni.

Emotions aside, the contest at the Narendra Modi Stadium holds significant importance for Gujarat Titans, who desperately need a strong comeback after a heavy defeat to Lucknow Super Giants in their previous match.

Gujarat Titans currently sit atop the table with 18 points, and a victory will secure a top-two finish. However, a loss to CSK on Sunday could see them slip from those coveted positions - a bitter blow for one of the season's most consistent sides.

GT vs CSK: HEAD-TO-HEAD

CSK have lost four games in seven meetings to Gujarat Titans. Incidentally, this is the first meeting between the two sides in IPL 2025. CSK, however, have won three of their last four matches against the former champions.

GT vs CSK: TEAM NEWS

There are no reported injury issues in either of the camps. Gujarat Titans will be hoping to get the best out of Jos Buttler and Kagiso Rabada as their two overseas stars will not be available for the playoffs.

Buttler, who has been a pillar at No. 3 for the Titans, will be hoping to make one big impact and ensure Gujarat seal a place in the top two, which offers them an extra shot at reaching the final.

Gujarat might think about resting Rashid Khan, who has been off colour in this season. In their previous game against LSG, Rashid was taken to the cleaners by Mitchell Marsh. A breather before the playoffs might be a welcome change for the Afghanistan superstar.

The top three teams in the Indian Premier League continued to falter in the final games of the tournament, making the top 2 race more complicated this season. After Gujarat Titans and Royal Challengers Bengaluru lost their respective matches, Punjab Kings also floundered against Delhi Capitals on Saturday, at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.

Gujarat, Bengaluru, Punjab, and Mumbai Indians had already qualified for the playoffs this season. But it was yet to be decided which two teams would finish in the top spots. The top 2 teams get to play one additional game in the playoffs stages, giving them a better chance of qualifying for the final match.

Punjab's loss has given Mumbai Indians a huge chance of finishing in the top 2 spots in the tournament as the top 4 are separated by just 2 points at the moment.

All the top three teams, who have lost their 13th match of the tournament, faltered against teams who have already been knocked out of the playoffs race. Gujarat Titans still lead the table with 18 points to their name. Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru follow GT with 17 points each, and are then followed by Mumbai Indians who have 16 points to their name.

Mumbai play Punjab Kings in their last match, and if they win that game, they will overtake Punjab in the points table. RCB, on the other hand, play Rishabh Pant's LSG in the final match, and would need to win it if they want to maintain their position in the points table.

GT play last-placed Chennai Super Kings in their final match of the season. A win will ensure that they maintain their top spot in the points table.

Pat Cummins’ Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Ajinkya Rahane’s Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will play for pride when they meet in Match No.68 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 on Sunday, May 25 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi.

The finalists from last season couldn’t quite step up this time around. Despite their early elimination from the tournament, the Sunrisers will be high on confidence after they defeated Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by six wickets, followed by their 42-run win over Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).

advertisement

Cummins’ men are currently placed eighth in the table with 11 points and a net run rate of -0.740 thanks to wins in five out of 13 matches.

The Knight Riders, on the other hand, were officially knocked out of the IPL 2025 after their match against RCB on May 17 was called off due to rain. Rahane’s men will return to the field against the Sunrisers after an 18-day break.

SRH vs KKR: Head-to-Head

The Knight Riders have won 19 out of 29 matches against the Sunrisers since their first meeting in 2013, with one match in 2020 ending in a tie. At neutral venues, SRH have never beaten KKR in their three meetings. Kolkata also have a 5-0 lead over Hyderabad in their last five meetings.

Rovman Powell and Moeen Ali won’t be available for the game for KKR. The Knights roped in mystery Shivam Shukla as Powell’s replacement, but it’s unlikely that he will get a chance. Venkatesh Iyer could return to the playing XI if he has recovered from his hand injury.

Josh Hazlewood has rejoined the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) for the remainder of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 season. Earlier in the month, there had been uncertainty surrounding the Australian pacer's return after the tournament was temporarily suspended due to air raids between India and Pakistan.

Hazlewood has linked up with the RCB squad ahead of their final league-stage match against the Rishabh Pant-led Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) on Tuesday, May 27, at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.

The 34-year-old fast bowler returns to IPL action after recovering from a shoulder injury. According to reports from ESPNcricinfo, Hazlewood underwent rehabilitation in Brisbane during the mid-season break and has now regained full fitness. His comeback is expected to bolster RCB’s bowling lineup.

“Good to be back! Hope to get the ball rolling again and start practice tomorrow,” Hazlewood said in a video on RCB’s official social media accounts.

Hazlewood has arguably been the standout bowler for RCB as he is their leading wicket-taker of the competition. In 10 games, the speedster has taken 18 wickets at an economy rate of 8.44 with a four-wicket haul to his name.

Hazlewood had missed RCB’s previous match against the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) on May 3 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium due to the same shoulder injury. During the break, he travelled to Brisbane for a closely monitored recovery process, as confirmed by RCB’s Director of Cricket, Mo Bobat.

After serving his duties for RCB, Hazlewood is set to join the Australian team for the World Test Championship (WTC) final against South Africa, which is set to get underway on June 11 at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground.

As far as RCB are concerned, they will be looking to bounce back from their 42-run defeat to the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH). For RCB to have any chance of finishing in the top two, Rajat Patidar’s men need to win their last league match when they face the Super Giants.

Not everything is lost in translation – sometimes, entire worlds are found. This is especially true of Indian literature, which both Indians and the world have discovered, all thanks to translations. This was also acknowledged in the International Booker Prize, which was awarded to two Indian women this year. Writer Banu Mushtaq and translator Deepa Bhasthi won the award for their collection of short stories, Heart Lamp.

advertisement

"These beautiful, busy, life-affirming stories rise from Kannada, interspersed with the extraordinary socio-political richness of other languages and dialects," said Max Porter, Chair of the 2025 committee, announcing the prestigious award.

This is the second International Booker in three years for an Indian author – a testament to the variety and power of Indian literature. In 2022, it was the translation of Ret Samadhi that won Geetanjali Shree the award.

The English translation of Ret Samadhi – Tomb of Sand – by Daisy Rockwell introduced both non-Hindi readers in India and the world to Geetanjali Shree's work. Tomb of Sand was published in Britain in 2021. Since winning the award, it has sold 30,000 copies in Britain and 20,000 reprints in India.

Such is the importance of translation that the International Booker Prize, formerly known as the Man Booker International Prize, has been instituted for works translated into English.

advertisement

The work of translation is intricate. What seems like a verbatim translation of written words is a larger conversation with the original text and the realisation of how to best convey the context, the people and their sentiments to a reader, for whom those concepts might be absolutely alien.

Come to think of it, there wouldn't be any world literature without translation.

Much of what we consider world literature today — Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Haruki Murakami, Orhan Pamuk — was made accessible only through translation. It is through this invisible art that languages speak to each other, and the world listens.

It was Ralph Manheim, a great translator of the works of writers Bertolt Brecht and Hermann Hesse, who once said, "Translators are like actors who speak the lines as the author would if the author could speak English."

The latest Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to South Korean writer Han Kang after her works were translated. Deborah Smith learnt Korean to translate Han's works into English.

The tradition of translating India to the world is not new.

Over a century ago, Rabindranath Tagore translated his own poetry collection, Gitanjali, into English. He became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913.

advertisement

Originally in Bengali, Gitanjali (Song Offerings) introduced the spiritual depth and lyrical beauty of Indian poetry to the world.

Tagore's win marked a pivotal moment in the global recognition of Indian literature. In more recent years, works like Perumal Murugan’s Pyre and Fire Bird, and M Mukundan's Delhi: A Soliloquy have found new audiences through translation.

Translation is especially important for a country like India that is culturally and linguistically diverse.

"Without translation, people in a country like India would be locked into their own linguistic islands," Arunava Sinha, a literary translator, tells India Today Digital.

HEART LAMP, TOMB OF SAND AND THE MANY 'ENGLISHES'

In Kannada, Mushtaq's anthology – Heart Lamp – is called Haseena Mattu Itara Kathegalu.

After receiving the International Booker Award, Mushtaq said of her short stories that her heart had been her field of study. But for the Booker prize judges, it was the "new textures" of the stories and their "radical translation".

"A radical translation which ruffles language, to create new textures in a plurality of Englishes. It challenges and expands our understanding of translation," stated Max Porter.

Languages do not naturally map onto each other and await intricate translation.

advertisement

That translation is particularly difficult when it comes to new words or expressions, was revealed by Frank Wynne, one of the member judges of the International Booker in 2022, when Geetanjali Shree's book won the award.

"In Tomb of Sand, I loved all three. World play, punning, neologisms and humour," said Wynne. "These are inherently difficult to translate since languages do not map onto one another; this is all the more true when the cultural context is very different."

In India, Tomb of Sand sold 50,000 copies, making it a resounding success for a work of literary fiction, and Ret Samadhi sold more than 35,000 copies. The novel became ubiquitous in train stations and airports across India, the New York Times reported.

INDIAN LITERATURE REACHES INDIANS, AND THE WORLD

Translated literature is about listening to the varied voices from across the world, sometimes even from the corners of one's country.

"How will we talk to one another and listen to one another without translation? Translation is the language of democracy," author-translator Sinha tells India Today Digital.

While Heart Lamp and Tomb of Sand were winners of the International Booker Prize, Tamil writer Perumal Murugan's Pyre made it to the award's longlist in 2023.

advertisement

Pyre reached the global audience because of the translation by Aniruddhan Vasudeva. The judges acknowledged how it was both "specific and universal" and "how flammable are fear and the distrust of others."

This was also seen in Murugan's Fire Bird.

Janani Kannan's translation of Fire Bird made the novel accessible to a global audience. Fire Bird won the 2023 JCB Prize for Literature, with Murugan receiving Rs 25 lakh and Kannan Rs 10 lakh in prize money.

The jury praised Kannan's translation for carrying "the rhythms not only of Tamil but of an entire way of being in the world", amplifying the novel's universal appeal.

Similarly, the English translation of M Mukundan's Delhi: A Soliloquy (originally Delhi Gadhakal in Malayalam), translated by Fathima EV and Nandakumar K, played a crucial role in elevating the novel's visibility and impact.

The translation introduced Mukundan's vivid portrayal of Delhi’s underbelly and the lives of Malayali migrants to international readers.

LOST IN TRANSLATION: WHAT REMAINS UNTRANSLATED

Translation, while a bridge between cultures, is not without its gaps. The act of carrying a story from one language to another often leaves behind subtle nuances, cultural idioms, and emotional undercurrents that defy translation.

advertisement

For instance, the rhythmic cadence of Tamil in Perumal Murugan's Pyre. Words rooted in specific cultural practices – like the term Agmark (a certification mark), used colloquially to denote authenticity in Fire Bird – lose their immediacy when substituted.

The untranslatable also includes the intangible: the smell of rain-soaked earth in a Malayalam poem, the cadence of a Bengali lullaby, or the weight of Partition's trauma in Ret Samadhi.

As translator Aniruddhan Vasudeva noted in a 2023 interview, "You can translate the words, but the silences between them? That's where the story lives."

When asked about translation and its limitations, Geetanjali Shree had a point to make: "Translation is not about producing a replica or a clone. It is making another living being that carries the culture of the earlier one in a new avatar".

MANY MARQUEZ IN INDIA'S REGIONAL CRYPTS?

Though translation has certain limits, it is this magical art that completes world literature as we know it.

Gregory Rabassa's translation of One Hundred Years of Solitude captured the lyrical richness of Marquez's magical realism, letting non-Spanish readers experience a Colombia infused with myth and memory.

Similarly, Michael Heim's rendering of The Unbearable Lightness of Being made Kundera’s Czech philosophical reflections accessible, resonating with Cold War-era readers exploring questions of identity, freedom, and political disillusionment.

These translations did more than convey meaning – they recreated rhythm, tone, and cultural nuance, allowing the soul of each work to survive linguistic migration.

Constance Garnett's translation of Anna Karenina made the classic of Russian literature reach the world.

Pamuk's My Name is Red, through Erdag Goknar's deft translation, brought Ottoman aesthetics and philosophical depth into global consciousness, with dense cultural layers made legible but not diluted.

There is no need to make a case for translation, but it is important to reiterate how vital it is for the world of literature.

Edith Grossman, Marquez's translator, once stated, "The impact of the kind of artistic discovery that translation enables is profoundly important to the health and vitality of any language and any literature".

That is truer for entire genres of Indian literature. Oral traditions, regional folklore, and lesser-known dialects languish without translators or publishers.

What if they are pulled out of their regional crypts, and placed under the sun? We would discover the soul of Indian literature –and a whole new universe.

India has climbed a spot in the global economic rankings, overtaking Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy, NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam said on Saturday. The country’s GDP has touched the $4 trillion mark, placing it behind only the United States, China and Germany in size.

Speaking after the 10th Governing Council meeting of the policy think tank, Subrahmanyam attributed the rise to a combination of domestic reforms and a global environment that is increasingly leaning in India’s favour.

advertisement

“As I speak, we are now the fourth-largest economy. We’ve reached a $4 trillion economy,” he told reporters, citing the latest IMF estimates to underscore India’s economic ascent. “Only the US, China and Germany are ahead of us. If we stick to our path, we could become the third-largest in just 2.5 to 3 years.”

The milestone comes amid an evolving global economic landscape where India is positioning itself as a key alternative manufacturing hub. Subrahmanyam responded to recent remarks by former US President Donald Trump, who said iPhones sold in the US should be made domestically rather than in countries like India.

“The specifics of future US tariffs remain unclear,” he said, “but India will continue to offer a cost-competitive manufacturing base regardless of those dynamics.”

He also revealed that a fresh wave of asset monetisation initiatives is in the pipeline. The government is preparing a second round of its asset monetisation programme, expected to be rolled out in August.

The economic milestone comes at a politically significant time, just as India looks to deepen its role in global supply chains and attract fresh investments under its ‘Make in India’ push.

Alia’s final look on the Cannes carpet was an amalgamation of heritage and haute couture. Styled by Rhea Kapoor, the look is allegedly Gucci’s first-ever interpretation of the Indian saree.

Now, onto the blouse, which was everything that radiated drama on the red carpet, featuring a similar metallic mesh-like design. The pallu, naturally the talk of social media, flowed like an elongated train. That GG monogram though! (Photo: Getty Images)

The styling was smartly restrained with a clean diamond riviere necklace with ear-studs to match. She let her hair down quite literally (and thank god for that) in soft waves, followed by makeup that was nude, dewy, and just kohl-rimmed eyes getting all the attention.

This was Alia’s first major Gucci outing post her global ambassadorship with the house, and it delivered precisely what it needed to, an East-meets-West flex without the cliche.

Commenting on the April 22 Pahalgam attack, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who is leading a parliamentary delegation under Operation Sindoor outreach, said that he doesn't work for the government during an interaction at the Indian Consulate in New York.

He praised India's strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir terror camps and said India "hit hard and smart".

Tharoor said, "I don't work for the government, as you know. I work for an opposition party. I myself authored an op-ed saying the time has come to hit hard but hit smart. I'm pleased to say that's exactly what India did."

He added that India, on May 7, carried out "very precise and calibrated strikes", targeting "nine specific known terrorist bases, headquarters, and launchpads" in Pakistan and PoK.

Tharoor also said that the time had come to set a "new bottom line" in India's dealings with Pakistan. "We have tried everything - international dossiers, complaints, everything has been tried," he added.

He said that Pakistan had remained in denial, with "no convictions, no serious criminal prosecutions, and no genuine attempt to dismantle" its terror infrastructure. "The persistence of safe havens...you (Pakistan) do this, you are going to get this back," he added.

Referring to India's recent response under Operation Sindoor, Tharoor said the country had now demonstrated its ability to strike with "a degree of precision". He clarified, however, that India did not seek war with Pakistan. "We are not interested in warfare," he said. "We would much rather be left alone to grow our economy and pull our people into the world they are getting ready for in the 21st century," Tharoor added.

Tharoor pointed out that while India remained a status quo power, Pakistan did not. He said Pakistan continued to covet Indian territory and was willing to pursue its objectives through terrorism when conventional means failed. "They are willing to get it through terrorism, and that is not acceptable," the Congress MP said.

Shashi Tharoor's delegation will visit five countries, including the United States, Panama, Guyana, Brazil and Colombia. The delegation also includes BJP MPs Tejasvi Surya, Bhubaneswar Kalita and Shashank Mani Tripathi, LJP (Ram Vilas)'s Shambhavi Choudhary, TDP's GM Harish Balayogi, Shiv Sena’s Milind Deora, JMM’s Sarfaraz Ahmad, and former Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu.

Under the shimmering skies of the Cte d’Azur, Kush Maini etched his name into racing history with a spectacular victory in the Formula 2 Sprint Race on the iconic streets of Monaco.

Displaying precision, composure, and unshakeable focus, he claimed his first F2 win of the season—and his maiden podium with DAMS Lucas Oil—at the most prestigious venue in motorsport. This historic achievement makes him the first Indian driver to win at Monaco.

advertisement

Starting from pole position, the BWT Alpine F1 Team reserve driver showcased masterful control and strategic poise throughout the race. He made the most of a strong start and managed the pressure with veteran-like maturity, securing a dominant lights-to-flag victory.

Maini had qualified P10 for Sunday’s Feature Race, placing him on pole for Saturday’s Sprint Race due to the reverse grid system. From the moment the lights went out, the DAMS driver led confidently for all 30 laps.

“P1 and first Indian to win at Monaco. It’s a great honour and a dream come true, really. I want to thank DAMS and everyone who’s supported me. We keep believing,” said an emotional Kush after the podium celebration.

Business tycoon Anand Mahindra, the chairman of Mahindra Group, heaped praise on Kush Maini for the incredible achievement.

Taking to X, Mahindra wrote, “You are Standing Tall, @kmainiofficial and the country stands tall with you. Kush Maini making history as the 1st Indian winner of an F2 race in Monte Carlo. We are proud to have you on our team at @MahindraRacing.”

Following a challenging start to the 2025 season, the Monaco win arrived at the perfect moment - boosting both his confidence and momentum at a critical point in the calendar.

In what was a truly special moment for Kush and the nation, he proudly sang the Indian national anthem during the podium celebrations. Indian business tycoon Gautam Singhania was seen embracing Kush in the pit lane after the win. Singhania’s JK Racing, along with TVS Racing, have supported Maini throughout his career.

With this landmark victory, Kush now looks to carry the momentum into Sunday’s Feature Race and into the upcoming round in Barcelona next weekend.

Two Texas residents have been arrested for allegedly operating a criminal racket that exploited the US immigration system through fraudulent visa applications, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced this on Friday.

Abdul Hadi Murshid, 39, and Muhammad Salman Nasir, 35, both originally from Pakistan, were taken into custody following a joint investigation led by FBI Dallas and federal law enforcement partners.

advertisement

The duo now faces multiple federal charges, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, visa fraud, money laundering conspiracy and Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) conspiracy.

The charges were announced by Acting US Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, Chad E Meacham. Murshid and Nasir are also accused of unlawfully obtaining and attempting to obtain US citizenship.

According to the indictment, the accused, along with the Law Offices of D Robert Jones PLLC and Reliable Ventures, Inc., allegedly orchestrated a large-scale visa fraud scheme for financial gain.

Investigators claim they submitted false and fraudulent applications on behalf of non-citizens - referred to in the indictment as "visa seekers" - to help them enter and remain in the US illegally.

On social media, FBI Director Kash Patel praised the arrests, writing on X, "Major arrests out of @FBIDallas. Abdul Hadi Murshid and Muhammad Salman Nasir - two individuals out of Texas who allegedly oversaw and operated a criminal enterprise circumventing American immigration laws by selling fraudulent visa applications. Well done to our FBI teams and partners in the investigation."

If convicted, Murshid and Nasir each face up to 20 years in federal prison.

Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina intensified her criticism of interim government head Muhammad Yunus, accusing him of "selling the country to the United States." Her renewed attack follows reports that Yunus threatened to resign after the military called for general elections to be held in December, prompting fresh waves of protest across the nation.

Hasina further alleged that Yunus is governing with the support of militant groups and condemned the recent ban on her party, the Awami League, calling it unconstitutional.

advertisement

In a strongly worded Facebook post, Hasina invoked the memory of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding leader of Bangladesh, claiming he was assassinated for refusing to cede St. Martin’s Island to the U.S.

"When America wanted St. Martin's Island, my father did not agree. He had to give his life. And that was my destiny. Because I never had the thought of selling the country to stay in power," she recalled.

"And the country that the people of this country responded to the call of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, took up arms and fought and gave their lives to free three million people. It cannot be anyone's intention to give up even an inch of that country's soil to anyone. But what a misfortune it is today. Such a person came to power, a person who is absolutely loved by the people of the whole country, a person who is loved by the world, and what happened to that person today when he came to power?," she added.

advertisement

Hasina repeated her allegation that Yunus has seized control of the government with the help of extremist groups.

"He has seized power with the help of terrorists, with the help of terrorists, all the terrorists, even those who are banned in various international arenas, from whom we protected the people of Bangladesh. After only one terrorist attack, we took strict measures. Many were arrested. Now prisons are empty. They released everyone. Now Bangladesh is the reign of those militants," she said.

She also slammed the Awami League’s ban, calling it both illegal and unconstitutional.

"The constitution of our great Bengali nation, we got it through a long struggle and through the liberation war. Who gave this militant leader, who has illegally seized power the right to touch the constitution? He does not have the mandate of the people, has no constitutional basis. That position (Chief Advisor) also has no basis, and it does not exist. So how can he change the law without a parliament, this is illegal. They have banned the Awami League," Hasina added.

On Saturday, Yunus warned of public-backed action if pressure was piled on them through "unreasonable demands". The warning comes after calls for elections by December from the army chief and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).

Delhi Capitals batter Sameer Rizvi revealed that it was teammate Karun Nair’s aggressive intent that allowed him to play with composure and freedom during their clash against Punjab Kings on May 24. Rizvi went on to anchor the innings with an unbeaten 58, guiding DC to a six-wicket win in their final IPL 2025 league match.

The victory, which came in Jaipur, saw DC chase down PBKS’s 207 with a strong collective effort. The opening pair of KL Rahul and stand-in skipper Faf du Plessis gave the side a good start, but it was Nair’s brisk 44 off 27 balls that shifted momentum and allowed Rizvi to settle in for the long haul. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Rizvi — who was named Player of the Match — credited Nair for giving him the platform to pace his innings with confidence.

IPL 2025, PBKS vs DC: Highlights

“When I came in to bat, the required rate was high. My approach was to take three or four balls to settle in and then start attacking. Karun Nair, on the other hand, smashed four boundaries in an over, which eased the pressure on me and allowed me to take my time," Rizvi said.

Karun Nair, who recently earned a recall to the Indian Test squad after seven years, has been making headlines for his return to top-tier cricket. The 33-year-old, known for his triple century in Tests, was included in the 18-member Indian squad for the upcoming five-match Test series against England, starting on June 20 at Headingley. His selection marks a return to Test whites after over 3,000 days.

Nair’s journey back to the spotlight was kickstarted by a successful domestic season, followed by a return to the IPL after three years. Picked up by Delhi Capitals in the 2025 mega auction, he made an immediate impact with a blazing 83 against Mumbai Indians in his first match of the season.

While DC failed to qualify for the playoffs, their win over Punjab did significant damage to PBKS’s top-two ambitions. The Nair-Rizvi partnership was central to that result, ending DC’s campaign on a high.

Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has asked Shubman Gill to take inspiration from Ajinkya Rahane ahead of the upcoming tour of England. Gill has been appointed as the captain of the Indian Test team following Rohit Sharma’s retirement. The upcoming England series will be his first assignment as the skipper as India begin their new era without Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.

advertisement

Ahead of the series, Kaif has asked Gill to talk to Rahane as he also led a young team in Australia during the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2020-21. Hence, he has advised the youngster to take inspiration from him as he embarks on his journey as Test captain.

“When Rahane was leading India in Australia, before the Gabba Test everyone had said that it is a very young team. So, Gill should probably phone Rahane and have a chat, because Rahane had done some brilliant work in that tour with a young side. Gill has to do something like that as well,” Kaif said in a video shared on his X account.

Rahane led the Indian team to a famous series win in Australia after Virat Kohli returned home after the first Test for the birth of his first child. The stand-in captain inspired the young team to script a remarkable comeback in the series as they eventually went on to win by 2-1, ending Australia’s 34-year unbeaten streak at the Gabba.

Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant has been handed the vice-captaincy of the Test side. Karun Nair has finally made his comeback after eight years after plundering runs in domestic cricket. Mohammed Shami has failed to find a spot due to fitness concerns, while Arshdeep Singh has earned his maiden Test call-up. Sarfaraz Khan has also been dropped from the team despite not getting a single chance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25.

During a visit to Pahamjula village in the Jirang constituency of Ri-Bhoi district, Chief Minister Sangma made an unplanned stop at a local school. While interacting with the students, he noticed a boy struggling to play guitar chords.

Instead of watching, Sangma, known for his interest in music, walked up to the student and offered to help. In the video shared on his Instagram account, the Chief Minister was seen demonstrating chord patterns and guiding the student.

Sharing the video online, Sangma wrote, “At Nongspung A village in Jirang, a student showed keen interest in playing the guitar, so I handed one to the school during my visit there. He may be an amateur now, but I’m confident he will learn and play when we inaugurate their new school building someday.”

The video drew admiration from social media users. Several users appreciated the Chief Minister’s approachability and the time he spent with the children. “The act of kindness and love It’s great to see your time with the students on music,” a user said, while another added, “Wish I had the privilege to meet such a great leader. Sir, you are truly an inspiration.”

A duck rearer in Tirupati and his family have been arrested for illegally detaining a tribal woman and her three children as bonded labourers. The family is also charged for allegedly burying her son in secret after forcing him to stay behind as "collateral" for a Rs 25,000 loan.

The victim, Anakamma, belongs to the vulnerable Yanadi tribal community. She, her husband Chenchaiah, and their three children began working under exploitative conditions after borrowing rs 25,000 from the accused.

advertisement

Following Chenchaiah's death, the lender reportedly refused to release the family unless the debt, inflated to Rs 45,000 (including Rs 20,000 as interest), was repaid.

Desperate to leave, Anakamma was told she could only go if she left one of her children behind as a guarantee. Left with no alternative, she complied.

Her son, left with the accused, stayed in intermittent phone contact and frequently pleaded for rescue, citing harsh labour conditions and abuse.

The last conversation between mother and son took place on April 12. After arranging the repayment by the end of April, Anakamma returned for her child.

However, she was met with a series of evasive explanations from the duck rearer and his family. First, they claimed that he had been sent away, then told Anakamma that her son was hospitalised, and finally, they claimed that he had run away.

advertisement

Sensing foul play, she contacted local tribal leaders and filed a police complaint. Under police interrogation, the duck rearer confessed that the boy had died and had been buried secretly near the residence of his in-laws in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu.

The body was exhumed by the authorities in the presence of Anakamma. Tirupati District Collector Venkateswar confirmed the child had been taken to a hospital, allegedly suffering from jaundice.

However, the covert burial and failure to notify the family have cast serious doubt on the circumstances of the boy’s death.

The police have booked the duck rearer, his wife and their son. They face prosecution under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, the Juvenile Justice Act, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.

A post-mortem examination is underway to determine the exact cause of death.

Punjab Kings assistant coach Sunil Joshi confirmed that star spinner Yuzvendra Chahal missed their Indian Premier League (IPL) fixture against Delhi Capitals on May 24 due to injury — a setback for the team as they prepare for the playoffs. Chahal has been the side’s lead spinner this season, and his absence could prove costly for the Shreyas Iyer-led outfit, especially as they continue to push for a top-two finish in the league.

advertisement

PBKS suffered a six-wicket defeat to DC in their Jaipur clash on Saturday, and Chahal’s absence was notably felt in their bowling attack. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Joshi revealed that the 34-year-old was rested due to a niggle. Although the assistant coach refrained from delving into the specifics of the injury, it was evident that the spin department lacked bite without Chahal on the field.

IPL 2025, PBKS vs DC: Highlights

"Chahal has a small niggle, so we are just resting him. That's the idea," Sunil Joshi said.

In Chahal’s place, Praveen Dubey was handed a chance to feature alongside Harpreet Brar in the spin department. However, the 31-year-old all-rounder bowled just two overs in PBKS’s defence of 206, conceding 20 runs without picking up a wicket. Brar returned figures of 2 for 41, but the absence of Chahal remained a key factor in Punjab’s lacklustre bowling display.

advertisement

Chahal bloomed late into great form for PBKS in IPL 2025, which even saw the experienced spinner pick up his second IPL hat-trick during his side's clash against Chennai Super Kings in April this year.

Delhi’s batting unit capitalised well on the situation, with KL Rahul and stand-in skipper Faf du Plessis stitching a 55-run stand before Sameer Rizvi guided the chase with a match-winning, unbeaten 58. The loss has dented Punjab Kings’ hopes of finishing in the top two, and the uncertainty over Chahal’s fitness only adds to their concerns ahead of the knockout stages.

In today’s competitive job market, sending out the same resume for every job opening is no longer effective. Employers expect resumes to be customised for the role, and many use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to screen candidates. That’s where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in—it helps you tailor your resume quickly and effectively, improving your chances of landing an interview.

Using AI to tailor your resume can save time, increase your visibility, and make you a stronger candidate. By aligning your skills with each job’s requirements, you show employers that you’re not just looking for any job you’re ready for this one. The result? Smarter applications and better opportunities.

advertisement

WHY TAILORING YOUR RESUME MATTERS

When you apply for a job, your resume should speak directly to the role. Tailored resumes:

Highlight relevant skills and experience

Show that you understand the company’s needs

Improve your match rate with ATS algorithms

Help hiring managers see you as a strong fit

AI tools make this process faster, smarter, and more precise.

HOW AI CAN HELP CUSTOMISE YOUR RESUME

AI can analyse a job description and identify important keywords—such as skills, qualifications, and job titles—that should be reflected in your resume. Matching these terms increases the chances of passing automated screenings.

AI can suggest ways to rephrase bullet points, restructure content, or emphasise achievements that align better with the job you're applying for. This ensures your resume is not only relevant but also impactful.

AI can also enhance the readability of your resume. It helps identify passive language, long-winded sentences, or unclear phrasing and offers suggestions for improvement, ensuring your resume is professional and polished.

STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO USING AI FOR RESUME

Start by reading the job post carefully and noting key responsibilities, required skills, and qualifications.

Use AI to identify the most important words and phrases from the job description.

See which skills and experiences on your resume match and which ones need to be added or emphasised.

Adjust your resume content to better reflect the language and priorities of the job description—without copying it verbatim.

AI can ensure your resume is clear, professional, and properly structured.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

Use AI to highlight real skills and achievements—never fabricate information.

Tailoring doesn’t mean rewriting your entire resume. Focus on key sections like the summary, skills, and recent job experience.

AI helps with structure and content, but make sure your resume still sounds like you. Recruiters value authenticity.

A Zepto delivery executive allegedly assaulted a customer following an argument over address mismatch in Bengaluru’s Basaveshwaranagar. The incident, which happened on May 21, was captured on CCTV.

The delivery executive, identified as Vishnuvardhan, allegedly shouted at the customer’s sister-in-law for providing the wrong address. When Shashank, the customer, intervened and questioned the aggressive behaviour, the delivery boy reportedly abused him and physically assaulted him.

CCTV showed the delivery boy violently punching the man as two women tried to intervene. According to police sources, a notice has been issued to Zepto seeking information regarding the allegations and the accused. The investigation is underway.

The victim said, "On the May 21, my wife placed an order on Zepto. The Zepto delivery boy named Vishnuvardhan brought the items to our address. When he arrived, my sister-in-law went out to collect the order. As she approached him, he suddenly started ranting, claiming the address was wrong."

He added that when he questioned the delivery boy over his behaviour, he started thrashing him.

"I had to undergo a CT scan and several tests at the hospital. The doctor has informed me that the bone underneath my eye is fractured. If it doesn't heal within a week, I will have to undergo surgery," he added.

The man has registered a complaint with the police and said that he wanted to share the video to make people aware so that they do not face the same situation.

"When you order something from Zepto tomorrow, I don’t want you to go through what I went through. This is the message I want to convey to everyone, and that’s why I made this video and that’s why I made this video and uploaded it," he said.

The Basaveshwaranagar police have registered a case under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, Sections 115(2), 126(2), 351(2), and 352.

Four members of a family, including a one-year-old boy, were killed in a hit-and-run incident at Kunjampatti near Usilampatti in the district on Saturday.

All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) MP Asaduddin Owaisi interacted with prominent figures in Bahrain as part of an all-party delegation led by BJP MP Baijayant Panda. During the outreach programme, he emphasised that the problem of terrorism emanates from Pakistan.

"Unfortunately, we have lost so many innocent lives. This problem emanates from Pakistan only. Unless and until Pakistan stops promoting, aiding and sponsoring these terrorist groups, this problem won't go away," he said.

He said that the Indian government has sent them over there to tell the world about the threat India has been facing since last so many years, referring to Pakistan-based terrorism.

The AIMIM chief further emphasised India's firm stance on security, saying, "Our government has taken all the steps to protect the lives of every Indian. This government has made very clear that next time you [Pakistan] take up this misadventure, it will be beyond what they are expecting..."

He asserted that India has repeatedly exercised maximum restraint despite grave provocations and cited the April 22 Pahalgam attack where 26 tourists were killed.

"Please reflect on the human tragedy of this massacre. A woman married six days ago became a widow on the seventh day. Another woman, married just two months ago, also lost her husband in this attack," he said.

HIGHLIGHTS INDIA 'S DEFENCE CAPABILITES

Owaisi highlighted India's defensive capabilities during his interaction in Bahrain. "India has all the wherewithal, and we have every means necessary to ensure the safety of not only Indian citizens, but also every individual residing in India," he said.

"The government and the media, our air defence system, our technology and warfare capabilities, successfully intercepted and neutralised everything that was launched by a failed state like Pakistan," he added.

CALLS FOR COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO COMBAT TERROR

The AIMIM leader also called for international collaboration to combat terror financing and appealed to the Bahrain government to aid in reinstating Pakistan on the FATF grey list.

"There is unanimity in our country, irrespective of whatever political affiliations we belong to. We have our political differences, but when it comes to the integrity of our country, it is high time our neighbouring country understands... I request and hope that the Bahrain government will help us in bringing Pakistan back to the grey list of FATF because this money has been used to support those terrorists," he said.

India has sent a delegation led by BJP MP Baijayant Panda includes MPs Nishikant Dubey (BJP), Phangnon Konyak (BJP), Rekha Sharma (NJP), Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM), Satnam Singh Sandhu, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and Ambassador Harsh Shringla, to brief international partners on India's stance following recent intense tensions with Pakistan.

The Election Commission has announced assembly by-polls for five constituencies across four states.

These constituencies include Kadi and Visavadar in Gujarat; Nilambur in Kerala; Ludhiana West in Punjab; and Kaliganj in West Bengal.

The voting for all five assembly seats is scheduled for June 19. The counting of votes will be held on June 23.

The Election Commission also shared the reason behind the by-elections in these seats.

advertisement

For these by-polls, the Commission has decided to use Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs) in all polling stations. Adequate numbers of EVMs and VVPATs have been made available to ensure a smooth electoral process.

The election process will be completed by June 25.

With the announcement, the Model Code of Conduct has come into effect in all five constituencies. According to the Commission's Secretary, Ashwani Kumar Mohal, the provisions of the Model Code of Conduct have come into immediate effect to guide all political parties and candidates involved in the election.

Therefore, the provisions of the Model Code of Conduct, as issued by the Commission during the by-elections on January 2, 2024, will be applicable in matters related to the release of funds under the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) for the concerned parliamentary constituencies of the respective legislative assembly areas.

advertisement

Among other things, these provisions ensure that no new funds under MPLADS are to be released to any part of the district where the concerned assembly/parliamentary constituency going to elections is located, until the completion of the election process.

If the constituency is located in a state capital/metropolitan city/municipal corporation area, then the above directions will apply only to the concerned constituency.

Similarly, no new funds will be released under the Local Area Development Fund of MLAs/MLCs. If any such scheme is ongoing, no funds can be released under it until the election process is completed.

The provisions clearly state that no work shall be started for which a work order has been issued before the issuance of this letter but where the actual work has not commenced. Such work can only be initiated after the completion of the election process. However, if any work has already actually started, it may continue.

Additionally, the third important provision is that there will be no restriction on releasing payments for works that have been completed, subject to the full satisfaction of the concerned authorities.

According to the Election Commission, where schemes have been approved and funds have either been made available or released, and construction materials have been procured and delivered to the work site, such schemes may be implemented as per the program.

BJP Rajya Sabha MP Ram Chander Jangra stirred a political storm when he suggested that the widows of the Pahalgam terror attack should have "fought back against the terrorists instead of pleading for their husbands’ lives".

"They (women tourists) should have fought. I believe they should have fought. This would have resulted in lesser casualty. If all the tourists have been Agniveer they would have tackled the terrorists ultimately reducing casualties. We have to reignite the spirit of bravery in our sister like Queen Ahilyabai,” Jangra said while addressing a gathering during his visit to Bhiwani on the occasion of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Jayanti.

His remarks have drawn sharp criticism for being insensitive to victims of terrorism. Congress MP from Rohtak, Deepender Singh Hooda, strongly condemned Ramchandra Jangra’s remarks, calling them deeply offensive.

Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh accused BJP leaders of repeatedly insulting the Indian Army and martyred soldiers, calling it a reflection of their "petty and degrading mindset".

In a post on X, Ramesh referred to a recent controversial remark by BJP Rajya Sabha MP Ramchandra Jangra and said the statement was shameful. He alleged that the BJP, "intoxicated by power," has become so insensitive that instead of holding anyone accountable for the security lapse in the Pahalgam terror attack, its leaders are now questioning the martyrs and their widows.

He also pointed out that no action has been taken so far against leaders like Vijay Shah and Devda, who have made similar controversial remarks in the past. "This new statement is extremely objectionable," he said.

Ramesh questioned the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP leadership, asking if it should be seen as silent approval of such comments. The Congress leader demanded that Prime Minister Modi issue an apology for the remarks and expel MP Ramchandra Jangra from the party.

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav strongly condemned Ramchandra Jangra’s remarks, calling them deeply offensive and unacceptable.

In a post on X, he wrote, “Even the word 'condemnable' would object to being used for such a disgusting statement by the BJP MP about the victimised women of Pahalgam. Instead of honoring women, the BJP chooses to insult, blame, exploit, and harass them in every possible way—this is their true face, and it is both shameful and revolting.”

He further added, “The BJP is not a political party, but a cesspool of anti-women mentality.”

Additionally, Congress’s social media head, Supriya Shrinate condemned the remarks made by the BJP MP in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

“BJP MP Ramchandra Jangra is talking about the women who lost their husbands in the Pahalgam attack. “She did not have the spirit of a warrior. She did not have passion, she did not have zeal, she did not have heart. That's why they folded their hands and became a victim of the bullet”,” Shrinate quoted Jangra in her post.

“And party talks about vermilion? There's a limit to shamelessness,” she added.

When questioned about the lack of arrests in the Pahalgam attack, Jangra stated, “Our army has destroyed the hideouts and masterminds of the terrorists, even if the attackers haven’t been caught.”

The statement comes more than a month after the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed 26 lives on April 22. The attackers targeted unarmed civilians, sparking nationwide outrage and condemnation.

At the event, the BJP MP also took aim at internal Congress matters, sharply criticising Rahul Gandhi by saying, “No one takes Rahul seriously, nor should they,” and accusing him of maligning India abroad.

In contrast, he had words of praise for Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, calling him an intellectual and lauding his diplomatic efforts, including initiatives like Operation Sindoor, to counter Pakistan on the international stage.

Delhi woke to chaos on Sunday as a powerful thunderstorm, accompanied by torrential rain and gusty winds, swept through the city, grounding flights, flooding roads, and causing widespread disruption.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued a red alert late Saturday, warning of violent thunderstorms and winds reaching up to 60 kmph, urging residents to stay indoors and avoid open spaces.

advertisement

What Fuelled the Storm?

According to the IMD, the storm’s intensity was the result of a rare and complex interplay of weather systems over northwest India.

Moisture-laden easterly and southeasterly winds from the Bay of Bengal, along with southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea, converged at lower levels of the atmosphere over the region.

These collided with dry northerly and northwesterly winds at mid-levels, creating the perfect conditions for intense thunderstorm activity.

This volatile mix was further intensified by three major weather systems:

A Western Disturbance, manifesting as an upper air cyclonic circulation over north Punjab and adjoining Jammu & Kashmir, with a trough extending into the middle and upper tropospheric westerlies.

An upper air cyclonic circulation over northwest Uttar Pradesh and adjoining north Haryana, about 1.5 km above sea level.

Another upper air cyclonic circulation over West Rajasthan and its neighbourhood in the lower troposphere.

advertisement

The interaction of these systems led to rapid cloud development, heavy downpours, frequent lightning, and strong winds across Delhi and neighbouring states.

IMPACT ON THE GROUND

The storm struck in the early hours, grounding flights at Indira Gandhi International Airport and leaving streets waterlogged in areas like Minto Road and Moti Bagh.

Commuters faced knee-deep water near airport terminals, and fallen trees and branches blocked several roads. The IMD also warned of moderate crop damage, particularly to banana and papaya plantations, and urged caution around unstable structures and water bodies.

This marks Delhi’s second major weather disruption in a week, highlighting the city’s vulnerability to sudden, intense storms driven by complex atmospheric interactions.

The system is also being influenced by climate change which is affecting global weather patterns.

With more unstable weather forecast, authorities continue to urge vigilance and preparedness.

As the world dashes into an AI-driven future, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has a clear message for teens: learn now or be left behind. Hassabis leads Google DeepMind, the advanced research lab behind the company’s most high-end AI developments, including the Gemini chatbot. The lab is also spearheading Google's efforts toward achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) — a yet-unrealised form of AI capable of human-level reasoning. At the recent Google I/O developer conference, Hassabis said DeepMind is likely less than a decade away from building AGI. As he works in such an environment, he certainly knows what form AI will take in the near future.

advertisement

Speaking on the popular tech podcast "Hard Fork," Hassabis encouraged teenagers to dive head-first into artificial intelligence, describing it as the defining technological force of their time. "Just as the internet shaped millennials and smartphones defined Gen Z, generative AI is the hallmark of Gen Alpha," he said. "Over the next 5 to 10 years, I think we're going to find what normally happens with big new technology shifts, which is that some jobs get disrupted. But new, more valuable, usually more interesting jobs get created."

AI is the future

On the podcast, he advised young people to familiarise themselves with AI tools and concepts sooner. "Whatever happens with these AI tools, you'll be better off understanding how they work, and how they function, and what you can do with them," he noted. He even suggested a mindset shift for students preparing for university, encouraging them to become "ninjas" with the latest technologies. "Immerse yourself now," he said. "Learning to learn is key." The CEO's advice aligns with growing initiatives across the education sector.

advertisement

Yet Hassabis doesn’t believe tech-savviness alone will be enough. He underscored the value of a solid STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) foundation, particularly coding, while also highlighting the importance of broader "meta skills" like creativity, adaptability, and resilience.

"These are the capabilities that will help the next generation thrive," he explained. "Getting good at the basics of STEM is still crucial, but equally important is developing the mindset to navigate constant change."

Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022, the AI landscape has evolved rapidly, sparking both excitement and anxiety about its impact on the workplace. As the race toward AGI intensifies, Hassabis believes preparing young people to understand, use, and innovate with AI is one of the most important challenges of our time.

His message is clear: AI is not just the future — it's the present. And for Gen Alpha, those who embrace it early will have a head start in a world increasingly shaped by intelligent machines.

AI is changing the world: Here is how to deal with it

Earlier this month, Hassabis also stepped forward to advise students on how to adapt to the evolving AI world. Speaking about the impact of artificial intelligence on education and employment, Hassabis encouraged young people not just to focus on technical knowledge, but to build a deeper understanding of themselves and how they learn. “It’s important to use the time you have as an undergraduate to understand yourself better and learn how to learn,” he said.

advertisement

Hassabis, a leading figure in AI innovation, warned that while hard skills remain important, many of them are already being performed more efficiently by machines. Instead, he suggests students prioritise flexibility and cognitive agility — qualities that will be harder for AI to replicate. “This capability,” he explained, “is more durable and valuable than specific hard skills, which may quickly become outdated in the face of technological advancement.”

With generative AI accelerating the pace of change, Hassabis says students need to be proactive and curious. He recommends taking advantage of spare time at university to explore fast-evolving fields and experiment with new tools beyond the formal curriculum. “Learn the basics through your formal education, but experiment in your spare time so you’re up to date when you graduate,” he advised.

The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) is on high alert for pollution response following the sinking of the container vessel MSC ELSA 3 off the coast of Kochi in the early hours of Sunday. All 24 crew members aboard the Liberian-flagged ship were safely rescued, with 21 picked up by ICG ships and 3 by the Indian Navy's INS Sujata.

The vessel was carrying 640 containers, including 13 classified as hazardous cargo and 12 containing calcium carbide. It also had 84.44 metric tonnes of diesel and 367.1 metric tonnes of furnace oil onboard, posing a significant risk of marine pollution.

ICG has intensified surveillance and is deploying pollution response measures of the Kerala coast. Aircraft equipped with oil spill mapping technology are currently monitoring the area. As of now, no oil spill has been detected.

The ICG remains on standby to respond to any environmental impact or spill that may arise due to the incident.

The incident took place on Saturday when distress communication was received by the Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre (MRSC) at Kochi.

The 184-meter-long vessel, travelling from Vizhinjam to Kochi, had developed a 26-degree starboard list approximately 38 nautical miles from the coast, placing it at risk of capsising. The cause of the accident is currently unknown.

Upon receiving the distress call, ICG deployed a Dornier aircraft for aerial reconnaissance and rescue support. The aircraft identified liferafts in the water with crew aboard and deployed additional rafts to aid the evacuation.

ICG ships and two merchant vessels, MV Han Yi and MSC Silver 2, were diverted to assist under global Search and Rescue (SAR) protocols.

Rescue efforts saw coordination between multiple agencies. Twelve crew members were rescued by ICG ship Arnvesh and nine by MV Han Yi. By 10 PM on May 24, three key crew, including the captain, chief engineer and second engineer, remained onboard to support salvage efforts.

However, early on May 25, the vessel capsised and sank at coordinates off Kochi coast. The remaining three crew were rescued by INS Sujata.

In this episode, veteran defence journalist Sandeep Unnithan joins host Dev Goswami to decode Operation Sindoor — India's response to Pahalgam terrorist attack.

Sandeep and Dev dive deep into how India’s layered air defence network, including the IACCS (Integrated Air Command and Control System), played a pivotal role in thwarting Pakistani aerial threats. What was the X factor that gave India the edge? Was the much-talked-about S-400 system deployed? What was sitaution like in the commmand and control centre?

The two also explore the escalation ladder — a concept from military theory — and how India used it both during the days of fighting of Operation Sindoor and more broadly to counter Pakistan’s nuclear posturing. Why is this theory studied so deeply in strategic circles? And how does it play out in real-time decision-making?

Sandeep and Dev also look at the Indian Navy's posturing during the conflict as well as the roles played by the Indian Army and Indian Air Force. And as a final thought, the two discuss Pakistan's Kirana Hills and the speculation that the nuclear weapons storage site may have been hit during the operation.

Amid the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan, prominent members of the Indian Parliament take on the world to dismantle the propaganda and lies spread by Islamabad about Operation Sindoor . The mission conducted by the Indian forces was in response to the Pahalgam terror attack that led to the death of 26 tourists in Kashmir, sending shockwaves across India.

During their respective addresses in different countries, the Indian MPs echoed the same sentiment: that New Delhi will not tolerate terrorism. The MPs are members of the all-party delegation formed by the government to spread India’s message worldwide.

On Saturday, a delegation led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor paid their respect at the 9/11 memorial after arriving in the United States. Tharoor was flanked by MP Ganti Harish Madhur, MP Shashank Mani Tripathi, MP Bhubaneswar Kalita, MP Milind Deora and former Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu. The delegation was also accompanied by India’s Ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra.

The memorial is a tribute of remembrance, honouring the 2,977 people killed in the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, at the World Trade Centre site, near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon, as well as the six people killed in the World Trade Centre bombing on February 26, 1993.

‘We came as a reminder that terrorism is a shared problem’: Tharoor

After paying his respects at the memorial, Tharoor told the media the purpose of the Indian delegation’s visit to the United States. “It was obviously a very moving moment for us, but it was also meant to send a very strong message that we are here in a city which is bearing still the scars of that savage terrorist attack in the wake of yet another terrorist attack in our own country,” the Congress MP averred.

“We came both as a reminder that this is a shared problem, but also out of a spirit of solidarity with the victims, who included Indians…it is a global problem…we must fight it unitedly,” he added. While interacting with prominent personalities, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey echoed Tharoor’s sentiment and condemned the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) funding of Pakistan.

“Since the last 2-3 days, the IMF is insisting that Pakistan not divert money for anything else and use it for the cause only. We feel the IMF will do something else. It is our presumption. Our request to you is that we are here because we are facing a great problem with Pakistan…we need your support,” said Dubey.

While representing India in Bahrain, BJP leader Baijayant Panda said that India will no longer be blackmailed by ‘Pakistan’s nuclear bluff". “Our new doctrine is, we have called their (Pakistan) nuclear bluff, we will no longer be blackmailed by their nuclear bluff….we can and will retaliate, things will never go anywhere close to being nuclear because our intention is not hostility, our intention is to extract the cost to deter them,” Panda said during an interaction session in Bahrain.

During the same interactive session, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) MP Asaduddin Owaisi emphasised that the terror organisations operating in Pakistan used religion to justify the killings, adding that Islam condemns terrorism. “These terrorist organisations have justified killings of innocent people in India, and they have out of context quoted Quranic verses…we have to put an end to it. They have used religion to justify the killing of people. Islam condemns terrorism and the Quran has categorically stated that the killing of one innocent person is like the killing of the whole of humankind,” Owaisi averred.

Taking a sharp dig at Pakistan for backing terrorism as a matter of state policy, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, speaking in New York on Saturday, praised India’s to the Pahalgam terror attack. He is currently leading a multi-party delegation to five countries as part of India’s global outreach against terrorism under Operation Sindoor.

At the Indian Consulate, Tharoor said the Pakistan-backed attackers had targeted victims based on their religion, describing it as a clear attempt to incite communal violence.

Emphasising the success of Operation Sindoor , he lauded the security forces for India’s targeted strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, stating that India had “hit hard and hit smart”.

“It was a group of people going around identifying the religions of individuals and killing them on that basis — clearly intended to provoke a backlash in the rest of India, as the victims were overwhelmingly Hindu,” Tharoor said.

“There was an extraordinary amount of unity cutting across religious and other divides in India — precisely the opposite of what the perpetrators had hoped to provoke. The message is very clear: there was a malign intent… and sadly, India had no reason to doubt where it came from.”

‘I don’t work for the government…’

Speaking on India’s response to the Pahalgam attack, Tharoor said, “I don’t work for the government, as you know — I represent an opposition party — but I personally wrote an op-ed in one of India’s leading newspapers just days after the attack, stating that the time had come to hit hard and hit smart. I’m pleased to say that’s exactly what India did.”

He added, “It was obviously a very moving moment for us, but it was also intended to send a very strong message — that we are here in a city which still bears the scars of that savage terrorist attack, in the wake of yet another terrorist attack in our own country.”

Terrorism is a global issue

Speaking about the purpose of the all-party delegation’s visit, Tharoor explained, “This visit is an opportunity. In every country, we will meet members of the executive, the legislature, think tanks, and influential foreign policy experts, while also engaging with the media and the wider public.”

He highlighted the solidarity shown in Jammu and Kashmir — from politicians to civilians — in the aftermath of the attack. “There was an extraordinary display of unity, cutting across religious and other divides that certain elements had sought to exploit. The message is very clear: there was a malign intent… and sadly, India has no reason to doubt where it originated.”

“Sadly, Pakistan chose its usual path of denial. In fact, with China’s support, it succeeded in having references to the Resistance Front removed from the UN Security Council’s press statement just two days later,” he added.

Tharoor underlined that “India sent a clear message — it would not take terrorism lying down. It would respond. But by carrying out calculated and precise strikes on specific targets, India also signalled that this was not the beginning of a long war, but a single act of retribution. The intention was to end it there.”

The all-party delegation led by Tharoor includes Shambhavi Chaudhary (Lok Janshakti Party), Sarfaraz Ahmed (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), G M Harish Balayagi (Telugu Desam Party), Shashank Mani Tripathi, Tejasvi Surya, Bhubaneswar K Lata (all BJP), Mallikarjun Devda (Shiv Sena), and former Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu.

The delegation aims to present India’s national consensus and firm stance on combating terrorism in all its forms, carrying the country’s strong message of zero tolerance to the global community during this outreach initiative.

The Yellow Hat movement that has taken over rural France has become a major headache for French President Emmanuel Macron, but a key to the parliament for National Rally’s Marine Le Pen read more

A yellow wave is taking over rural France with farmers in the country expressing discontent with the French President Emmanuel Macron and his government. This month, hundreds gather to celebrate a landmark victory for their movement, led by Coordination Rurale Union.

The group that staged demonstrations across the country is known for its signature yellow hats and had made unprecedented gains in February’s farming union elections. With the win, the union broke the hegemony of the establishment FNSEA in representing farmers in France and Brussels.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

According to Politico, the Coordination Rurale Union was at the forefront of recent farmers’ protests in France, outflanking the FNSEA with hard-hitting action, ranging from confrontations with President Emmanuel Macron to setting manure on fire in front of government buildings. However, the aggressive tactics of the group also acquired criticism for what rivals said are intimidation tactics.

How it started and its connection with the National Rally Party

According to the reportage by Politco, the movement was born 40 kilometers from Auch, in the heart of Gasscony, near the Spanish border. Serge Bousquet-Cassagne one of the key figures of the group has around 17 court appearances for actions ranging from vandalizing supermarkets to illegally constructing water basins used for irrigation.

“In this country, if you don’t burn cars you don’t get acknowledged,” he said during a conversation with Politico. Interestingly, Bousquet-Cassagne is closely associated with the French political far right, having called National Rally President Jordan Bardella “their last hope.”

The close association has also sparked speculations that the movement is being fueled by the right-wing party led by Marine Le Pen. Not only this, the overall farmers’ protests have also led to a large chunks of the French countryside swinging far right.

How Le Pen’s party support is swelling

After winning popularity in the industrial area of France, rural heartlands can prove to be a strong reservoir for the National Rally. The party has been trying to gain support in the region by blaming mainstream parties for failed farming policies and accusing Brussels of exposing EU markets to cheaper and inferior foreign produce.

According to the Reconquête Poll, 62 per cent of Yellow hat farmers are hard-core supporters of nationalist parties. The survey was conducted ahead of last June’s European election by research institutes Cevipof and INP Ensat.

Overall support for both the Yellow Hats union and Marine Le Pen’s party has surged in many parts of rural France, including in Gers, the administrative district to which Auch belongs. In last June’s snap elections, the National Rally got 35 per cent of the vote from this region.

Interestingly, that was up 15 percentage points from two years ago in a region that used to be a stronghold of the Social Democrats. Hence, in the year, the movement has become a strong asset to Le Pen and a headache to Macron.

The two men allegedly made money by helping foreigners, called “visa seekers,” enter and stay in the US illegally.

They filed fake visa applications, lied about job offers, and misused visa programs like EB-2, EB-3, and H-1B. To make the jobs seem real, they placed fake ads in newspapers, pretending to offer jobs to Americans as required by the US Department of Labour.

After getting approval, they applied for green cards for the visa seekers. They also took money from these visa seekers and returned part of it as fake salaries to make the jobs look legitimate.

“These defendants are charged with engaging in extensive measures to hide a massive, multi-year, immigration fraud scheme through which they reaped substantial personal financial gain,” said Acting US Attorney Chad E Meacham, adding that pursuing criminal charges was “top priority.”

Murshid and Nasir appeared in court on May 23, and the government wants them held in custody until their trial.

A hearing is scheduled for May 30. If found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison, and Murshid could lose his chance at US citizenship.

Hamas is reportedly on the verge of financial collapse amid the ongoing conflict with Israel, leading to widespread frustration among its members read more

Sources inside the Palestinian militant group Hamas have disclosed that the group is on the verge of financial collapse. According to a report by Al-Sharq Al-Awsat newspaper, the ongoing conflict with Israel is severely affecting both its military capabilities and finances.

The London-based newspaper mentioned that Hamas is struggling to pay salaries due to an intense financial crisis.

Sources indicated that the militant group has only been able to pay 900 shekels (around $240 USD) over four months, leading to widespread frustration among its members.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

The financial problems are compounded by significant leadership losses due to the Israeli Defence Forces’ (IDF) targeting of Hamas leaders, creating a leadership gap within the group’s governance.

IDF’s campaign continues in Gaza

Additionally, Gaza’s civil defence agency reported Saturday (May 24) that an Israeli strike in Khan Yunis killed nine children of two married doctors. The Israeli army is currently investigating these reports.

Israel has intensified its operations in Gaza recently, facing international criticism and calls to allow more supplies after partially easing a total blockade on aid enforced on March 2.

Footage from the civil defence agency showed rescuers retrieving badly burned remains from a damaged home.

When asked about the incident, the Israeli military stated it had targeted several suspects operating from a nearby structure.

UN says more aid needed in Gaza

The United Nations warned Saturday that only a teaspoon of aid was getting in Gaza following Israel’s 11-week-long blockade.

The Israeli military said 107 trucks carrying flour and other foodstuffs as well as medical supplies entered the Gaza Strip from the Kerem Shalom crossing point on Thursday, for a total of 305 since Monday when the blockade was relaxed.

But getting the supplies to people sheltering in tents and other makeshift accommodations has been fitful, and UN officials say at least 500 to 600 trucks of aid are needed every day.

Despite the relaxation of the blockade, distribution has been hampered by looting by groups of men, some of them armed, near the city of Khan Younis, an umbrella network representing Palestinian aid groups said.

“They stole food meant for children and families suffering from severe hunger,” the network said in a statement, which also condemned Israeli airstrikes on security teams protecting the trucks.

Sharif’s writ lies eroded even further, and Pakistan is lurching ever so close to another military dictatorship. The vexing questions on the Rawalpindi generals’ control over politics, economy, judiciary and even the media have now been put to rest read more

How do you deal with a problem like Pakistan? This question has vexed Indian policymakers and the political establishment for several decades. We are none the wiser despite several wars and kinetic conflicts, the latest of which took place just a few days ago. At the heart of the problem is a revisionist state where the public stays in a state of permanent suspension of disbelief, while its all-powerful military runs a rentier economy and conjures up alternative realities at will.

Consider, for a moment, how Pakistan fared in the latest battle. We already know well enough about the 11 of the 12 key Pakistani airbases hit by Indian missile strikes, some of which are still inoperable.

It suggested a complete failure of Pakistan’s China-supplied air defense system. The fact that Pakistan couldn’t protect its sensitive air assets, nuclear weapon storage sites or even nuclear command and control centres is a telling commentary on its incompetence. It explains why Pakistan’s beleaguered army chief “went running to the United States seeking immediate intervention.”

That the Pakistani DGMO, carrying a message of cessation of hostilities, was made to wait several hours before the Indian side even agreed to take the call on May 10 tells you who emerged with the upper hand. As the fog of war slowly lifts, the magnitude of Pakistan’s loss is slowly becoming clear.

The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has lost 20 percent of its infrastructure, including hangers, hardened air shelters (HAS), critical maintenance equipment and several of its fighter jets, such as an airborne early warning SAAB-2000 aircraft (AWACS) flying 300 km inside its own airspace. These are expensive beasts, even more so for a rickety economy like Pakistan’s that survives on doles.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

The SAAB Erieye-2000 flying radar was struck by India’s S-400 SAM system that was activated 11 times during the conflict. That’s not all. According to media reports quoting Indian defence sources, PAF lost one C-130 J medium lift aircraft, a JF-17 and two F-16 fighters to air-launched SCALP and BrahMos missiles. India also struck a Chinese-made LY-80 air defence system and took out the prized HQ-9 in Karachi using UAV and loitering munitions, reports Hindustan Times.

Pakistan also lost over 50 airmen, including squadron leader Usman Yusuf when Indian missiles struck Pakistan’s Bholari airbase at Sindh. The loss of so many lives, as well as high value assets within a span of a few hours would have demolished the swagger and sapped the confidence of any military outfit. But this is Pakistan. Its army has ‘never lost a war’. Within a few hours of the ceasefire that was agreed upon in distinctly dishonourable circumstances for the ‘Lumber One’ military, the Pakistanis declared a “win”, sparking nationwide ‘celebrations’.

As if at the flick of an invisible switch, Pakistan created an alternative reality where its all-powerful military not only beat back a much larger adversary, but scored an important tactical victory that further tightened the military’s grip over every aspect of Pakistan’s politics, society and economy.

Consider also the fact that within days of a demoralizing defeat, army chief Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of a Field Marshal, only the second military officer in Pakistan’s history to get the honour after General Ayub Khan in 1959. Khan, having ousted then President Iskander Mirza in 1958, helped himself to the title a year later.

With Munir’s ‘promotion’, Pakistan now has two illegitimate power centres in military and civil domains. Not even Shehbaz Sharif, heavily dependent on the military for survival, believes in his own legitimacy as the prime minister. Riddled with allegations of corruption, poor governance and lack of agency, the Sharif government had become deeply unpopular. As did the military, which for the first time in several decades was facing an organic pushback from the Pakistani middle class – that threw its lot with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan – for the military’s outsized influence on Pakistan’s polity.

The war with India changed everything. Battlefield reverses notwithstanding, Pakistan’s military was able to create an in illusion of victory in an ‘existential’ battle against India, with the aid of some creative myth making.

Losses were quickly hidden, the DGISPR shaped the counter-narrative on a war footing pressing into service dubious claims, fake news, AI generated video clips and round the clock press briefings. With the aid of the Western media’s discourse power that bought into Pakistani claims that Chinese-built J-10s shot down up to five Indian aircraft, including several Rafales, the narrative coup was complete.

Pakistan is now firmly under the grip of military nationalism, and the new generation of army sceptics has been bought over. The tide of popularity has swung in favour of the hitherto unpopular Munir in such a way that the jury is out on whether Munir adorned himself with the title of Field Marshal (Failed Marshal would’ve been more accurate), or whether Sharif, eager to curry favour with the new ‘hero’ of the Pakistani masses, decided to be a little creative.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

Either way, as the Pakistanis celebrate their hard-earned ‘win’ over India with a formal dinner with Munir as the ‘showstopper’ Pakistan.

Not even the mightiest of India’s cruise or ballistic missiles may destroy Pakistan with efficacy from within the way Pakistan’s military can. The most popular mass leader in decades is in jail under strictest of charges and harshest of conditions. The rebellion has been snuffed out. Sharif’s writ lies eroded even further, and Pakistan is lurching ever so close to another military dictatorship. The vexing questions on the Rawalpindi generals’ control over politics, economy, judiciary and even the media have now been put to rest. The military first claim to the poverty-stricken country’s resources finds renewed public mandate.

None can save Pakistan from its dance of death. Its embrace of instability, religious fundamentalism and the population’s collective somnambulance.

On average, men usually have five inches more in height than women. But why? Scientists have now found an answer to this pertinent question. A gene called SHOX, associated with height, is partially responsible read more

Men are generally taller than women. The two sexes have an average height difference of about five inches.

While this is a known fact, a question worth asking is: Why are men taller than women? Scientists have found an answer, which partially explains this: genes.

But how? Let’s understand.

How the study was conducted

A new study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday (May 19) involved the genetic data of nearly one million (10 lakh) people.

Researchers studied data from three biobanks – two in the United States and one in the United Kingdom.

Of the roughly one million people whose information was in the biobanks, the scientists found 1,225 people had missing or extra X or Y chromosomes, as per a New York Times (NYT) report.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

While men have one X and one Y chromosome, women have two X chromosomes.

The gene behind height difference



Scientists have found that a gene called SHOX is responsible for the difference in male and female heights.

Also called short stature homeobox-containing gene, it is linked to height. SHOX is present on both the X chromosome and the Y chromosome.

After studying the genetic data of more than 1,000 people who had either missing or extra X or Y chromosomes, researchers discovered that an additional Y chromosome gave a greater height boost than an extra X.

Men, on average, are about five inches taller than women. Representational Image/Pixabay

Matthew Oetjens, a genetics researcher at Geisinger College of Health Sciences in Danville, Pennsylvania, explained that the SHOX gene is placed near the end of the sex chromosomes, as per NYT.

In women, most genes on one of the two X chromosomes are inactive. However, the genes are active at the very tip of the X. The SHOX gene’s closeness to the tip ensures that it remains active.

In males, both X and Y chromosomes are fully active and so is the SHOX gene.

This means that the SHOX gene will provide more height to men than women. Researchers say this gene makes up for roughly a quarter of the average height difference between men and women.

Eric Schadt, a professor in the department of genetics and genomic science at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, told NYT that the study was “definitely cool”.

“It is a great use of these biobanks to uncover what is still somewhat of a mystery,” he said. “Even though the effect is modest, it does explain 20 per cent or so of the height difference.”

Other recent studies on human height

Another study, published in January, found that men have grown and increased in weight twice as fast as women over the past century, further raising the differences between the two sexes.

Being tall is not always a good thing. Representational Image/Pixabay

Researchers also previously found that women are more interested in taller men than men are in shorter women. However, being taller is not always a good thing.

Taller people are at greater risk of developing certain types of cancer. This could be because these people have more cells that can accumulate mutations, leading to the potentially fatal disease.

Shubman Gill has been named India’s new Test captain ahead of the England series. Let’s explore the challenges he may face and whether he is the right choice for the role, and if he can help India win their elusive World Test Championship title. read more

India’s Test team is entering a new era after the retirement of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravichandran Ashwin. Shubman Gill, one of the most promising young batters, has been given the mantle of the captaincy. The starting 20 June. It is going to be a tough challenge for Gill, given that he has never captained a Test match before.

Shubman Gill’s journey in red-ball cricket began with the 2020-21 tour of Australia, where he made a name for himself with a match-winning knock at the Gabba. Since then, he has become a regular in India’s Test side, scoring 1,893 runs from 32 matches at an average of 35.05. While he has performed well on home soil with an average of 42, his overseas form remains a concern, where he is averaging just 25.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

The upcoming England tour is his first full Test series in English conditions. Until now, he has only played in England during the 2021 and 2023 World Test Championship (WTC) Finals and the COVID-hit fifth Test match of the 2021-22 series. He has 88 runs from six innings in English conditions. Leading the team in these challenging conditions will test both his batting and leadership skills.

What are the challenges awaiting Gill?

Taking over as Test captain in the post-Rohit, post-Kohli, and post-Ashwin era is no easy task. The Indian team is in transition and Gill will have to deal with all the challenges that are expected to come along. The biggest challenge for him will be his inexperience in leadership in the longest format. Even though he has tasted measurable success as captain in the Indian Premier League, Gill is yet to prove his mettle at the biggest of stages.

Another thing that is expected to trouble Gill in his first assignment as captain are the conditions in England. The English conditions have historically challenged Indian batters and Gill is no exception. As mentioned above, Gill doesn’t have a good batting average outside India and his overall numbers are also not that impressive. Gill’s performance in England has not been up to the mark and if he fails to get going at the start of the series, it might become a big headache not just for him but for the entire squad.

Even though it is believed that the camaraderie in the Indian dressing room is positive, Gill might face some issues in managing senior players like Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja. They are currently the only big names left from the Ro-Ko era and Gill will have to be very careful in how he manages them. But, the Indian youngster will have some help from his deputy Rishabh Pant and head coach Gautam Gambhir when it comes to dealing with these stars.

Is Gill the right choice for captaincy?

It is a bold call by the Indian selectors but not surprising. Gill’s name was already circulating in the media before the official announcement was made by the BCCI. His leadership in the ongoing IPL season has been brilliant, with his team Gujarat Titans currently occupying the top spot on the points table. Former cricketers and experts have come out in support of the decision, backing Gill to do well as a captain in the red-ball format.

Former England captain Eoin Morgan, who played with him at Kolkata Knight Riders, called Gill a “natural leader.” Ex-India coach Sanjay Bangar, former opener Aakash Chopra, and commentator Harsha Bhogle also echoed the same views. Gill has captained India in shorter formats before and is currently the vice-captain of the ODI team. However, leading in Test cricket, especially away from home, is a completely different thing. His true test will be how he handles pressure and if it affects his batting.

Can Gill deliver the maiden WTC title?

India have reached the World Test Championship final twice, in 2021 and 2023, only to fall short each time. India lost the 2021 edition to New Zealand and went down in the 2023 final against Australia. In the 2025 cycle, India finished third after losing back-to-back series to the above-mentioned sides. Now, the goal is not just a series win in England but building a consistent Test unit that can win the next WTC cycle.

Gill has a strong squad and support from senior players like Bumrah, Jadeja, and Pant. He will also be backed by Gambhir and the BCCI. It will be interesting to see if he has the ability to inspire the team to do something special that even Rohit and Kohli couldn’t achieve in their illustrious careers.

While KL Rahul is among the top batters of the current generation and certainly the standout batter in the Delhi Capitals, former India cricketer Atul Wassan was less than impressed by some fans comparing the wicketkeeper-batter to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar. read more

KL Rahul is among top batters of the current generation and is integral to the Indian team in the Test and ODI formats. The 31-year-old is the Men in Blue’s first-choice wicketkeeper-batter in the 50-over format where he has been a match-winner in recent years, including in the 2023 World Cup and in the Champions Trophy earlier this year.

And with Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli having retired from Tests as well as T20Is, Rahul is expected to play an even more crucial role as a senior member of the team.

To compare him with batting legend Sachin Tendulkar, however, isn’t something that any sensible cricket fan, Indian or not, is likely to do. And when former India cricketer Atul Wassan was asked if Rahul in the current Delhi Capitals team could be compared to Tendulkar in the Indian team in the 1990s wherein people switch off their television sets the moment he’s dismissed, it’s safe to say that he was less than impressed.

“If you talk about KL Rahul and Sachin Tendulkar in the same sentence, then I will go. TVs are getting shut down because KL Rahul is getting out? Who are these people?” Wassan said on the Bails and Banter show on OTTPlay.

Wassan praises Rahul for his technique and confidence

in the IPL mega auction in November after he parted ways with the Lucknow Super Giants after leading the franchise for three seasons on less-than-amicable terms.

Rahul has been DC’s leading run-scorer this season, scoring 539 runs at an average and strike rate of 53.90 and 149.72 respectively which includes an unbeaten 112 against Gujarat Titans – which made him the first batter in IPL history to score a ton for three different franchises.

Rahul, however, did not get much support from the rest of the DC batting order with none of his teammates figuring among the top-20 run-scorers. Wicketkeeper-batter Abhishek Porel (301) and South African middle-order batter Tristan Stubbs (300) are the only other batters to score more than 300 runs this season.

While Wassan shot down the comparison with Tendulkar, who was a lone match-winner for the Men in Blue in the 1990s before the rise of Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Virender Sehwag and other batting icons, he did Rahul for his technique and confidence.

“He doesn’t rely on brute strength but trusts his technique. When he maintains his form, shape, and technique, he can execute risky shots with confidence,” he added.

Delhi Capitals finished their season with a thrilling six-wicket victory over Punjab Kings in Jaipur on Saturday, signing off 15 points that currently puts them at the fifth spot.

Rahul got his team off to a solid start with a knock of 35 off 21 balls, stitching a 55-run opening stand with stand-in skipper Faf du Plessis. It was Sameer Rizvi’s unbeaten 58 off 25 balls, however, that ultimately ensured DC chased down the 207-run target set by PBKS with three balls to spare.

After starting the season four consecutive wins, DC lost the plot in the middle and the latter half of the league stage, getting knocked out of the race to the playoffs with lopsided defeats against Gujarat Titans and Mumbai Indians, at which point they were on a five-match winless run.

The Indian film industry has given us several dynamic actors, be it Vicky Kaushal or Kriti Sanon. But did you know that these talents have also been serious scholars, who carry impressive academic credentials? We’ve spotlighted five actors who are academic achievers.

Vicky Kaushal:

In his initial days, Vicky Kaushal faced multiple hardships and despite that, he completed his education. His academic qualifications boasts of an engineering degree from Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology.

Ayushmann Khurrana:

Beyond being a Bollywood sensation, Ayushmann Khurrana is also a highly qualified personality. He carries a Bachelor’s degree in English literature from DAV College, Chandigarh, and he also completed his Master’s in Mass Communication from the School of Communication Studies in Chandigarh.

Kriti Sanon:

Kriti Sanon holds a degree in engineering from the Jaypee Institute of Information Technology. During India Today Conclave, the actress revealed that she has always been into academics, and shared that even though she wanted to become an engineer, she didn’t know what an engineer would do. She even sat for placements and received two job offers.

Kartik Aaryan:

Kartik Aaryan hails from a family of medical professionals. Having completed his schooling from Gwalior, he followed his passion for Science and pursued an engineering degree in biotechnology from Navi Mumbai. Beneath the layer of his academic journey, he also nurtured his interest in acting, and later he enrolled in an acting course at the Kreating Charakters Institute.

Pragya Jaiswal:

Apart from being one of the most in-demand actresses of today’s time, Pragya Jaiswal is also a credibly qualified individual. The ‘Daaku Maharaaj’ actress completed a law degree from Symbiosis Law School in Pune. During her initial days, she participated in multiple pageants and became a model, and later on, she ventured into the acting space.

Bhat also said, “It’s gone all over the world, and it has been received so well, with a thumping response. It had been to Cannes and within minutes the tickets were sold.” read more

Netflix’s ‘Black Warrant’ actor Rahul Bhat did Anurag Kashyap’s 2023 thriller Kennedy that was also showcased at the Mumbai Film Festival that year and opened to rave reviews. But it still remains unreleased in India.

And talking about the same, the actor said, “There’s a possibility that it will be released this year. We worked so hard on that film. It hurts, because what is acting all about if people don’t see? Why do we make movies or art?”

He added, “For people to appreciate it, see it, and tell you the good things, criticise you but tell you something! The whole purpose of art is to reach people. If it doesn’t reach people, then what’s the point?”

Bhat also said, “It’s gone all over the world, and it has been received so well, with a thumping response. It had been to Cannes and within minutes the tickets were sold. In Toronto too, tickets were sold the moment they opened it. "

He continued, “Here in Mumbai, I think they said in one-minute tickets were sold. In Kolkata, 2000 people were inside and 3000 were outside! There was a lathi charge. In producero ke kaan mein kuch sunai nahi padta hai ya kya pata nahi (I don’t know if this news even reached the producer), it’s crazy.”

In Kennedy, there’s an operatic feel even to the unflinching violence and humor Kashyap establishes in his scenes. There’s something gorgeous about the way he shoots brutality. The stretch involving jokes on Covid-19, a quarrelling family, and two gruesome murders in quick succession particularly stands out.

Kennedy begins with a quote of William Wordsworth about poets, their gladness, and madness, and despondency. This could also reflect on the characters in the film. The first shot shows Kennedy, the washed out hero, peeling an apple while smoking a cigarette. The never-ending peel comes off smoothly, the man knows how to strip something naked.

The Deepika Padukone controversy

Deepika Padukone was all set to reunite with Prabhas for ‘Animal’ director Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s next film Spirit. However, reports that have not been confirmed yet, suggest they may have to look for a replacement as she’s no longer a part of it.

A user on X commented stating why it happened. The comment read:

“Reasons for #SandeepReddyVanga Rejecting Deepika in #Spirit Film:

👉#DeepikaPadukone reportedly insisted on 8-hour shifts that barely allows for 6 hours of filming.

👉also demanded whooping 20 Crores for the project & also a share in profits, she allegedly refused to speak her Telugu lines.”

No confirmation about the same has been made yet.

According to figures released Thursday by the UK’s Home Office, over 6,000 US residents applied to either become British citizens or to live and work in the country permanently during the 12 months before March.

This is the highest such number since comparable records began in 2004, the Home Office stated.

6,618 Americans filed for British citizenship during that time; almost 1,900 of those applications were received during January and March, the majority of which occurred at the start of Donald Trump’s second term as US president.

The rise in applications at the start of 2025 resulted in the largest number for any quarter on record, according to The Guardian.

These numbers coincide with efforts by British officials under Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour administration to lower immigration to the UK.

Starmer recently vowed to take “back control of our borders” and warned that unchecked immigration may lead to the UK “becoming an island of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together.”

Before Starmer, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the British Parliament that there will be “provisions to qualify more swiftly that take account of the contribution people have made.”

Cooper also said that the British government will “introduce new, higher language requirements” because “the ability to speak English is integral to everyone’s ability to contribute and integrate”.

However, the surge in US applications to the UK may not reflect current political realities in either country.

Most of the 5,521 settlement applications submitted by US residents last year came from those who qualified due to family or spousal ties.

Afghanistan was rocked by a magnitude 4.2 earthquake on Sunday, the fifth to strike the nation in less than a week.

The National Center for Seismology (NCS) reported that the latest earthquake struck at a depth of 135 km at 6:33 am IST.

In a post on x, the NCS stated, “EQ of M: 4.2, On: 25/05/2025 06:33:39 IST, Lat: 36.26 N, Long: 69.74 E, Depth: 135 Km, Location: Afghanistan.”

Between May 16 and May 20, there were four prior earthquakes in the area. An earthquake of a magnitude of 4.2 was registered on Monday, May 19. An earthquake with a slightly greater magnitude of 4.5 occurred 150 km below the surface on May 18, one day earlier. Before that, on May 17 and 16, respectively, earthquakes with magnitudes of 4.2 and 4.0 were recorded.

The sudden increase in seismic activity has alarmed both locals and experts.

Afghanistan, particularly the Hindu Kush area, is classified as a seismically active zone because to its placement on the collision border of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. Additionally, a large fault line runs through the western province of Herat, which increases the region’s susceptibility.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and the International Red Cross have repeatedly emphasised how vulnerable Afghanistan is to landslides, earthquakes, and seasonal flooding.

Unidentified gunmen shot dead Andriy Portnov, a former Ukrainian politician on Wednesday (May 21) outside a school in a wealthy suburb of Madrid. Portnov was previously a senior aide to pro-Russian former Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovich, who was ousted in a 2014 popular uprising. Portnov left for Russia in 2014 and faced investigations in Ukraine over accusations of treason and embezzlement. He was slapped with European Union sanctions, although those charges were later dropped. See More

The southwest monsoon arrived in Kerala on Saturday, marking an early start to India’s rainy season. It also reached parts of the Northeast ahead of schedule, according to the IMD. read more

The southwest monsoon arrived in Kerala on Saturday, eight days earlier than usual, marking the start of India’s four-month rainy season. This is the earliest onset since 2009, when it began on May 23, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.

Along with Kerala, the monsoon also reached parts of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Mizoram, where it arrived 12 days ahead of schedule.

Though it hit both Kerala and the Northeast at the same time, officials say this doesn’t mean the monsoon will quickly cover the entire country.

Normally, the southwest monsoon makes its onset over Kerala by June 1 and covers the entire country by July 8. It starts retreating from northwest India around September 17 and withdraws completely by October 15.

More from India Southwest monsoon hits Kerala early, easing heat and boosting harvest hopes

The monsoon had set in over the southern state on May 30 last year; June 8 in 2023; May 29 in 2022; June 3 in 2021; June 1 in 2020; June 8 in 2019; and May 29 in 2018, IMD data showed.

Data available since 1975 showed that the monsoon reached Kerala the earliest in 1990 (on May 19), 13 days before the usual date.

According to meteorologists, there is no direct relationship between the onset date and the total rainfall over the country during the season.

The monsoon arriving early or late in Kerala does not mean it will cover other parts of the country accordingly. It is characterised by large-scale variabilities and global, regional and local features, an IMD official said.

The IMD in April forecast above-normal cumulative rainfall in the 2025 monsoon season, ruling out the possibility of El Nino conditions, which are associated with below-normal rainfall in the Indian subcontinent.

According to the IMD, rainfall between 96 per cent and 104 per cent of the 50-year average of 87 cm is considered ’normal'.

Rainfall less than 90 per cent of the long-period average is considered ‘deficient’; between 90 per cent and 95 per cent is ‘below normal’; between 105 per cent and 110 per cent is ‘above normal’; and more than 110 per cent is considered ’excess’ precipitation.

India saw 934.8 mm of rainfall in 2024, 108 per cent of the average and the highest since 2020.

In 2023, it recorded 820 mm, 94.4 per cent of the average.

In 2022, it saw 925 mm; 870 mm in 2021; and 958 mm in 2020, according to IMD data.

The monsoon is crucial for India’s agriculture sector, which supports the livelihood of about 42 per cent of the population and contributes 18.2 per cent to the country’s GDP.

It is also essential for replenishing the reservoirs critical for drinking water and power generation across the country.

The Supreme Court has urged the Centre to rethink the strict application of the Pocso law in cases involving consensual teenage relationships. It also called for a national policy on sexual and reproductive health education. read more

The Supreme Court has asked the Centre to consider decriminalising consensual relationships between teenagers so they are not jailed under the strict Pocso law. It also suggested creating a policy on sexual and reproductive health education.

A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan issued a notice to the Centre, asking the Ministry of Women and Child Development to set up an expert panel to study the issue and submit a report by July 25. The court said it will issue further directions after reviewing the report.

The court order was triggered by a legal case involving a woman from West Bengal who wanted to protect her husband. He was sentenced to 20 years in jail under the Pocso Act for having a relationship with her when she was 14.

The court appointed two senior women lawyers, Madhavi Divan and Liz Mathew, to help with this sensitive issue. They suggested that teenagers in consensual relationships should be protected. While the Pocso Act is important for protecting minors from sexual abuse, applying it strictly to teen relationships can sometimes harm the young person involved and their family.

On Saturday (May 24), a 21-year-old man with severe diabetes died at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Kalwa due to complications from both diabetes and Covid-19, according to the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC).

He was admitted on Thursday for diabetes issues and tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday night. The TMC also reported eight new Covid-19 cases in the city, bringing the total active cases to 18.

Only one patient is in the hospital, while the others are isolating at home, and all are in stable condition.

“The deceased had been admitted on Thursday due to diabetes-related complications and his Covid-19 test came out positive on Friday night”, said hospital superintendent Dr Aniruddha Malgaonkar.

A 19-bed ward has been set up at the hospital for Covid-19 patients, and it is equipped with RT-PCR testing facilities, he informed.

The civic body held a high-level review meeting on Friday to assess the situation.

“A sufficient stock of medicines has been maintained at all health centres and Covid-19 testing kits are readily available,” said chief medical officer Dr Chetna Nitil.

The civic body also assured that the situation was under control and appealed the public not to panic.

In Maharashtra, Mumbai has emerged as the epicentre of most Covid cases.

Mumbai has reported 95 cases in May, making up most of Maharashtra’s total infections. However, hospitalisations are low, with only 16 patients admitted. The BMC has advised testing for all patients with SARI symptoms.

Kerala, with 273 Covid infections in May, has the highest number of cases in India. The state health minister has instructed all districts to increase surveillance and made masks mandatory in hospitals. People with cough symptoms are advised to wear face coverings.

Karnataka has seen a slight increase with 35 cases, including a nine-month-old baby from Hoskote. People with Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) symptoms are advised to get tested.

Even though Andhra Pradesh has not seen a significant increase, it has instructed health facilities to maintain adequate stocks of vaccines, PPE kits, and triple-layer masks.

Meanwhile, Delhi has reported 23 cases, leading the government to instruct hospitals to ensure beds, oxygen cylinders, testing kits, and vaccines are available.

Experts believe the increase in Covid-19 cases in South Asia is due to the JN.1 variant , a sub-variant of Omicron. Although this variant is active, the World Health Organization (WHO) has not yet labelled it as a “variant of concern.”

The symptoms are usually mild, and people recover within four days. Common symptoms include fever, runny nose, sore throat, headaches, fatigue, and exhaustion.

Tensions between India and Pakistan have come to a pause. But Islamabad has received a real drubbing — its airbases have incurred massive damage and its missiles, drones and planes were downed. However, the neighbouring country doesn’t see a loss; after all, they promoted their army chief, Asim Munir, to field marshal. Here’s this and more in our weekly roundup read more

It’s been a busy, busy week in the world of news. A lot has happened in the past seven days, leaving a deep impact on the world.

The week gone by began with the sad and shocking news that former US President Joe Biden had been diagnosed with ‘aggressive’ prostate cancer. The news led many to question — had he been hiding this diagnosis while in the White House? How could it be so severe so quickly? How long did he have?

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

And talking about American presidents, no news cycle can be complete without Donald Trump. It’s been a busy week for the US president — he unveiled the “Golden Dome for America,” a multilayered defence system, ambushed his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office and escalated his battle with Harvard University.

The last seven days has also been noteworthy for the Asian subcontinent. Speculation is swirling that Bangladesh’s Muhammad Yunus is angry and unhappy at the current situation in the country and is threatening to resign. In the neighbouring country, Pakistan, the army chief General Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, making him only the second in the country’s history to earn a five-star ranking.

In our weekly wrap, we look at all this and more that has unfolded.

1) The week started on a sombre note for the Bidens and the former US president’s supporters. He announced that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.

His team in a statement said that his prostate cancer is “characterised by a Gleason score of 9”, meaning it is a “high-grade cancer”.

The news led to an outpour of support for the former US president. Biden’s former boss, Barack Obama, said that Biden would fight cancer “with his trademark resolve and grace” while Kamala Harris said that she was “saddened” to learn of the diagnosis.

The diagnosis also led many to search — what is prostate cancer? What are its symptoms? How serious can it be?

If you are asking the same questions, our report has the answers.

2) For many, the big news of the week continues to be Operation Sindoor, the targeted and precise military strikes that India carried out two weeks ago. While hostilities between India and Pakistan have been temporarily paused, details keep emerging. For India, the mission was a success — the military eliminated key terror bases deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). It also caused heavy damage to the neighbouring nation’s airbases after Islamabad chose to launch drones and missiles at civilian and military infrastructure.

One of the biggest triumphs for India during the strikes was the taking down of the Chinese-made PL-15 missile that Islamabad fired towards India. Shortly after that, the intelligence agencies of various countries reached out to New Delhi seeking access to the debris of the missile. Amongst those who urged India for access was the Five Eyes nations as well as France and Japan. But what would they gain out of this? Read here to find out.

3) On the topic of Pakistan, here’s some interesting news. The country’s army chief, General Asim Munir, received a promotion — he was elevated to the rank of field marshal, making him only the second in the country behind Mohammad Ayub Khan to receive the honour.

But one can’t help note the timing of the elevation. That’s because promotions and an honour such as field marshal is normally bestowed upon when a general leads his country to victory in a war. But that’s not the case for Munir, is it? The country received a severe bruising from India during Operation Sindoor — its airbases damaged and its drones and missiles neutralised by India’s defence systems.

In such circumstances, many wondered why the Shehbaz-Sharif led government chose to elevate Munir. Pakistani watchers also noted that it could be a sign of things to come — after all, the last field marshal of the country carried out a coup and established a military dictatorship.

4) In this week, Bangladesh has also been in the news — not for a good reason, though. On Thursday (May 22), rumours began to swirl that Muhammad Yunus, the country’s interim chief, was thinking of resigning. In fact, many of his advisers rushed to his house that evening to persuade him from stepping down.

But what’s the reason that the Nobel laureate was considering to put in his papers? Was it the fact that he was receiving intense criticism for not providing a proper roadmap to the elections in the country? Or is it because the tensions with Bangladesh army chief Waker uz-Zaman have further deteriorated?

Our report explores the entire situation and what Yunus’ resignation would mean for the troubled country.

US President Donald Trump announces his plans for the “Golden Dome,” a national ballistic and cruise missile defence system in the presence of Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office at the White House. AFP

5) When Pakistan rained down drones and missiles on India, it threw light on the country’s missile defence systems. And perhaps taking inspiration from that, US President Donald Trump unveiled the concept for what he calls the Golden Dome — a $175 billion sweeping missile defence programme unlike any the United States has attempted before.

The probable weapon is expected to not only protect the country from missile threats but also have space-borne weapons capable of intercepting missiles at various stages of flight. Sounds futuristic and right out of a Star Wars movie, right?

Trump doesn’t think so. He announced that it would become “fully operational before the end of my term,” which ends in January 2029.

But while Trump envisions a futuristic weapon to protect American soil, it’s not going to be easy. In fact, some think it’s not possible. Here’s more on that here .

6) Donald Trump is often referred to as tariffs man. And after this week, one could also call the US president smackdown man. On Wednesday, the US president laid an ambush for his incoming guest, South African leader Cyril Ramaphosa. The US leader lectured Ramaphosa on false claims that White South African farmers are the victims of a genocide .

The meeting was very reminiscent of Trump’s confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with many noting that Ramaphosa kept his cool and refrained from being ‘Zelensky-ed’.

But what went down in the Oval Office between Trump and Ramaphosa? Read on to find out.

7) While we are on the topic of Trump, his administration on Thursday escalated their battle with Harvard University. The US Department of Homeland Security announced that it had revoked the ivy League institution’s ability to enrol international students, delivering a sharp punishment to it for refusing to bow to the administration’s policy demands.

This move is a huge blow to foreign students, namely Indians who aspire to graduate from the elite university. It leaves the nearly 788 Indians in limbo , with many scrambling to find a transfer to another university or mulling a return to India.

Floyd, a father of five, had gone to a local convenience store in Minneapolis to buy cigarettes. A store clerk suspected he had used a fake $20 note and called the police.

When the officers arrived, they drew a gun on Floyd, who at first followed their instructions and allowed himself to be arrested. But when they tried to put him in a police vehicle, he said he was claustrophobic and resisted.

Police then pulled him from the car and pinned him to the ground. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds.

By the time an ambulance arrived, Floyd was unresponsive and was declared dead at a nearby hospital.

A video of the incident quickly spread on Facebook, and protests began in Minneapolis within hours. They soon spread across the country.

When the first ‘Star Wars’ film was released

On this day in 1977, Memorial Day weekend in the United States began with the release of Star Wars , the first film in what would become one of the most successful franchises in cinema history.

Created by George Lucas, the story is set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away” and follows Luke Skywalker, played by then little-known actor Mark Hamill, as he gets caught up in a battle between a powerful empire and rebel fighters.

Despite opening in just 42 theatres, the film made nearly $3 million in its first week. By the end of that summer, it had earned over $100 million in the US alone.

It would go on to become one of the most popular and influential film series ever made. Image: X

Star Wars won six Academy Awards and received a special honour for sound design. It transformed the film industry with its groundbreaking visual effects.

The film quickly became a cultural sensation. It led to a wide range of related media, including more films, TV shows, comics, toys, video games and merchandise.

Two sequels, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The Return of the Jedi (1983), brought back most of the original cast and were just as successful, both critically and commercially.

The Star Wars universe has continued to grow, with new films and series being released well into the 2020s.

Pakistan’s ‘triumphalism’ is a twisted admission of reality to manage audience costs and an implicit acceptance that it cannot harm India in return without going nuclear read more

On Wednesday, security forces chalked up an important victory in India’s ongoing fight against Naxalism, neutralizing Nambala Keshava Rao, alias Basavaraju, the general secretary and supreme commander of the CPI (Maoist). Union home minister Amit Shah called him the “topmost leader, and the backbone of the Naxal movement” carrying 1.5 crore bounty on his head.

During Operation Black Forest (also called Operation Kagar), 27 dreaded Maoists were eliminated, 54 arrested while 84 more surrendered in Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. According to reports, in the first five months of this year, India’s security forces in an intelligence-driven anti-Naxal operation neutralized close to 300 Naxalites, marking the fastest annual pace of elimination of left-wing extremists since 2009.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

As the minister said, India is on way to entirely eliminate the menace of this bloody insurgency by March next year, one which has over several decades bled India dry, killing tens of thousands, holding back development in some of India’s poorest pockets and spawning the toxic, left-wing extremist ideology that has taken deep roots in India’s politics, popular culture, media, and academia supporting violent insurrection against the Indian state. This has been a protracted, difficult battle but we are finally tasting sustained success.

Readers, I have started my assessment of Operation Sindoor with a report on India’s remarkable achievement against violent Maoist ideology because I want you to understand that while India has always been a hard state, it is only now that its capacities to deal with both external and internal threats are growing. These successes are linked to India’s rise.

The same resolve that was witnessed in decapitating the Naxal movement is evident in India’s dealing with the Pakistan problem, except now, as Operation Sindoor conclusively proved, India has more options in its arsenal in forcing Pakistan to accept painful conditions as a penalty for Islamabad’s persistent bad behaviour while avoiding major losses of its own.

What’s more, India has decisively shifted the Overton window of state response to terror perpetrated by Pakistan military trained, armed and sponsored proxies in such a way that kinetic retaliation against the Pakistani state is now ‘assured’.

Unlike Uri in 2016 or even Balakot in 2019 when India’s strategic restraint was the expectation and punitive action was the exception, resulting in constricted diplomatic space for conventional retaliation, the world has now come to accept that India will use military force under the nuclear threshold against Pakistan for instances of cross-border terror. As the diplomatic manoeuvres and statements from world leaders leading to Operation Sindoor showed, there’s even a tacit approval for India’s reprisal. This is the ‘new normal’.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

To lay down such a doctrinal framework, as the prime minister did in his address to the nation, against a nuclear-armed state is an incredible achievement in itself but an even more incredible, if under-analysed, achievement is that Pakistan itself has come to accept the price it has to pay for carrying out sub-conventional warfare against India.

Despite suffering crippling damage on its military infrastructure and the military-terrorist complex through which India demonstrated its clear military superiority, escalation dominance and redrew its red lines, Pakistan focused its entire narrative on yet unproven claims of downing a few Indian fighter jets.

As RUSI’s Walter Ladwig, senior Lecturer in International Relations in the Department of War Studies at King’s College, London, writes, “That misleading narrative obscures a more consequential truth: despite Pakistani tactical successes, India appears to have largely achieved its stated objectives. On the opening day of strikes, the Indian Air Force (IAF) demonstrated a credible capacity to identify and destroy what New Delhi characterised as terrorist-linked infrastructure in Pakistani territory, employing stand-off weapons to deliver precision strikes at speed. In the following days, operations expanded in scope, penetrating Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence network to target select forward airbases for the first time since the 1971 war.”

By declaring a ‘win’ despite this painful lesson and demonstrable battlefield reverses during which Pakistan was forced to accept that it cannot protect its prized air bases, or even its nuclear assets and the command and control apparatus from Indian drone and missile attacks, Pakistan has agreed to clear limits on its sovereignty.

Here, Pakistan’s ‘triumphalism’ is a twisted admission of reality to manage audience costs and an implicit acceptance that it cannot harm India in return without going nuclear. This is, quite simply, India’s biggest achievement from Operation Sindoor.

The impact of India’s actions against Pakistan falls in roughly three domains.

Geopolitical

In the geopolitical sphere, India now has a greater latitude to launch a military operation against Pakistan’s repeated perfidies. Pakistan’s core argument, that it will go nuclear if attacked by India, has been comprehensively defeated. Pakistan used the nuclear threat as a blackmail to stave off Indian retaliation after each act of cross-border terror, using international community’s insecurity over nuclear Holocaust as a deterrence. This tactic is no longer valid.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

However, India has achieved more than just proven space for limited military engagement and calibrated force. It has framed future terror attack as ‘act of war’, thereby adopting the doctrinal approach of an assured reaction. The apprehension over such a doctrine generating “commitment trap” is overblown. If we follow the letter and spirit of the prime minister’s multiple addresses closely (both the address to the nation and his speech at the Adampur Air Force base) there is enough space for discretion and tactical manoeuvring without letting opportunistic actors seize the initiative.

The alternative to a doctrinal approach is an ennui that India can no longer afford. Even if Modi were not to spell out the policy shift, public perception, political pressure and weight of precedence have already shifted in favour of a more robust approach as the mean.

On the contrary, India’s ‘assured military response’ is now taken for granted, and there is widespread recognition of India’s status as a responsible power that engages in calibrated punitive action with clearly defined strategic objectives.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

Lakhvinder Singh, director of peace and security studies at the Asia Institute in Seoul, writes in Asia Times, “The operation fits squarely within India’s long-standing doctrine of ‘active but restrained’ military engagement – an approach that seeks to diminish non-state militant capacities without destabilizing the broader regional order. This strategic calculus reflects not only India’s military capabilities but also its broader commitment to responsible international behavior.”

Two more points on this issue are worth noting. One, the fact that India didn’t bother to furnish evidence of Pakistan’s complicity in the Pahalgam massacre, knowing well enough that expecting admission of guilt from Pakistan is a fool’s errand, and didn’t bother convincing the international community of the moral justification behind its actions speaks of greater self-confidence as a rising power that uses sovereign means to settle its disputes.

Second, by its willingness to take risks against Pakistan despite the costs involved, India has turned the international community’s (read America’s) strategic calculus on its head. India’s escalation matrix, that culminated in a series of undefended precision missile strikes against key Pakistani Air Force (PAF) bases, including the Nur Khan base (close to Pakistan’s Strategic Plans Division that manages the country’s nuclear and missile programs), forced Islamabad to sue for peace through American mediation.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

This was crucial because India’s structural reticence was underpinned by its unwillingness to trigger nuclear war while punishing Pakistan. If India had to call for de-escalation, Pakistan would have been handed a strategic victory. It is a measure of the success of India’s limited-spectrum tactical operation that it was Pakistan that called for cessation of hostilities by its own volition, thereby handing India the chance to shape the outcome.

Military

In the military sphere India scored a clear, unambiguous victory, to the extent a triumph is possible over an adversary who has a high tolerance for pain and generates alternate realities. India’s biggest achievement in this domain is making Pakistan realise that it cannot export terror across the border at a discount. The asymmetric war will now attract asymmetric response.

The logic behind Operation Sindoor wasn’t deterrence. Pakistan is an irrational rational actor that while using nuclear weapons as a shield to carry out sub-conventional attacks against India – a feint to weaponize western insecurities – during a limited-spectrum kinetic conflict sticks to mutually understood escalation spirals.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

The flip side of this behaviour is that Pakistan is never going to give up its grey zone tactics of using terror against India – a move that has proven repeatedly beneficial for the Pakistani military’s standing at home – and therefore New Delhi cannot hope to use punishment as a deterrent.

For Pakistan, punitive action or threat of action does not trigger a change in behavior because anti-Indianness is the raison-d’etre of Pakistan’s survival as a state. It defines itself as ‘non-India’. This means that to change Pakistani behaviour, India must resort to such disproportionate force that it triggers an existential crisis for Pakistan in which case it may go nuclear.

From an assessment that Pakistan can be prevailed upon to act as a ‘normal’ state that has rational cost-benefit ratio, Indian policymakers are now increasingly partial to the view that Pakistan will never be a normal state, will not respond to conventional paradigm of deterrence and India’s strategy must therefore shift to imposing increasing costs so that Pakistan pays a heavy price for exporting terror, spend resources also on defensive strategies, or take evasive action.

In terms of these objectives, India’s military campaign has been a spectacular success. Fake narratives notwithstanding, Pakistan’s military knows well enough what awaits if it engineers another terror attack on India.

India has suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, impacting water flows inside Pakistan and has exposed the vulnerabilities of Pakistan’s vaunted airbases, airframes and nuclear assets. Not only must the Pakistan military atone for these failures, it must also come to terms with the fact that in a conventional war, India’s military will enjoy increasing and disproportionate superiority.

While the IAF could strike heavily defended targets within Pakistan at ease, and that too with pinpoint precision displaying high-end capability, Pakistan’s projectiles were nearly all thwarted by India’s layered air defence network. Indian Navy didn’t have to step in. Its menacing presence on the North Arabian Sea was enough. India had advanced air and space surveillance, controlled the escalation spiral and forced Pakistan to settle for a pause in hostilities.

Psychological

The trauma of Indian missiles striking the heart of Punjab, igniting airbases that sent waves of smoke spiralling into the sky for hours until the next day, more than 50 military personnel and over 100 terrorists getting killed not to speak of the loss of several fighter jets including 20% of PAF infrastructure was so deep that Pakistan’s army chief had to promote himself to the topmost military rank of Field Marshal, only the second one in Pakistan’s history, to create the narrative of a ‘win’.

This ties with the penchant for alternate realities that a revisionist Pakistan excels in. The signifier for the make-believe triumphalism had to be outlandish enough to convince the delusional populace that has been fed a steady diet of Pakistan military’s ‘invincibility’.

The maze of domestic narratives, carefully built and reinforced by the security state and a pliant media will never allow a shred of reality to sneak in. That said, India’s coercive operations targeting Pakistan’s sensitive installations, Islamabad’s complete failure in thwarting those strikes, and the demolition of terror infrastructure deep into Pakistan’s Punjab heartland will have created discontentment within the ranks of Pakistani military. Munir’s ‘promotion’ amid the ashes of Pakistan military’s reputational damage is its surest signal.

From May 1 until the 20th, I was travelling in the US and thus had to depend on Western media (mostly Twitter/X) for news about Operation Sindoor and the aftermath. It was self-evident that there was no point in reading things like the NYTimes, Washington Post, The Economist, etc, because one look at their headlines confirmed that they were “manufacturing consent”.

Soft Power

Given the difference in X posts that I read in the US and those in India, I think the algorithms were deprecating posts for me in ways that are hard to detect. In other words, there is a narrative war where India has no say but lots at stake. India’s soft power is seriously wanting. Joseph Nye, the academic who popularised that phrase, passed away this week; following his theories, it behooves India to make a concerted attempt to improve its storytelling.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

It faces an uphill battle because Western, especially American, media have shown an ability to gaslight at scale in three major stories in the recent past: the COVID panic, the “Trump-is-a-Russian-stooge” meme, and the “Biden is mentally sharp as a tack” story. They are good at it and have no love lost for India, and so India needs a long-term plan to get its own propaganda story out, for instance, developing an Al Jazeera-style global footprint or an X-style social medium.

The entire Western narrative, for self-serving purposes, continues to be against India, for good reason: they do not wish to see India grow into a peer-level competitor at the G3 level. In this, both China and the West are of one mind, and it shows. Besides, the West has every incentive to try to block India from becoming a major arms exporter: they would prefer India to continue to be one of the biggest importers, preferably from them.

Narrative warfare is a Western speciality, as I said in Information Warfare, Narrative-Building: That Kind of Warfare. In addition to kinetic warfare, India needs to up its game here too. Narratives have real-life consequences.

The Pakistanis have been quite successful in their own narratives, riding on Western media: here is an example from the Nikkei (which owns the Financial Times) from a Pakistani journalist. This is typical of the stories created by Pakistanis and amplified by western media: basically, that India took a major hit, with five or six high-end aircraft downed by Pakistani/Chinese weaponry. The story was repeated so many times that it essentially became the Truth. Have a look at this screenshot:

A Step Change in Aerial Warfare

My personal belief is that India won a victory on the ground and in the air, humiliating Pakistan, attacking it at will and exposing its Chinese armaments as below-par. Some thoughtful neutral experts support this view: See . India also demonstrated surprising competence in the new age of electronics-based warfare. It may no longer be expensive fighter jets (and by extension, aircraft carriers) that tilt the balance, but missiles, drones and integrated air defence.

This must be emphasised. There are periodic step functions in warfare that render earlier, victorious technologies/processes less valuable: this is similar to disruptive innovation, where the ‘insurgent’ firm nullifies the apparent advantages of the ‘incumbent’ firm. Often that means a point of inflection. An example is the arrival of the longbow in mediaeval times that made hitherto unstoppable heavy cavalry stumble. Another is the arrival of air power itself.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

Today there may be another point of inflection. Experts have suggested that warfare going forward will be software-driven, including drone swarms that can autonomously reshape their formations (reminiscent of the murmurations of flocks of starlings). Presumably, there will be plenty of predictive AI built in as well. Given India’s poor track record in software products, it was generally assumed that India would not do so well in such a new environment.

In reality, there appears to have been a clever integration of indigenous and imported technology to create an “iron dome” of sorts against Pakistan’s Chinese missiles, of which an advanced variant, PL-15, was apparently shot down intact.

More interestingly, it appears that Lakshya and Banshee drones were programmed to masquerade as Rafales, Sukhois, etc, by emitting their radar signals, thus attracting enemy fire towards themselves. This might explain the claims of five or six Indian aircraft shot down by Pakistan, whereas in reality they may have simply shot down the phantom, mimic drones.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

The implications are large: in effect, India was able to attack Pakistan at will; video evidence shows significant damage to terrorist sites in the first round and to military sites in the second round, including to key Pakistani air bases, as well as, it is said, the entrance tunnel to the nuclear storage facilities in the Kirana Hills. Indian air dominance appears to have forced the Pakistanis to beg for US support to suggest a cessation of hostilities.

This skirmish was proof in the heat of battle for India’s indigenous weapons, especially the BrahMos (although, of course, that is a joint venture with Russia). It may result in a number of serious queries from prospective customers, especially in Southeast Asia, who will be interested in battlefield performance against Chinese missiles and aircraft. This would be a win for India’s arms industry.

Conversely, there is a singular sore spot: fighter jets. For a variety of reasons, most especially the fact that the Kaveri engine has not been allowed to complete its testing and development phase, India is still dependent on others for advanced fighters. And this is just fine as far as they are concerned, because the Americans want to sell F-35s, the French want to sell more Rafales, and the Russians want to sell Su-57s.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

Here’s an X comment by a military historian who suggests that India’s fighter jets are inadequate. He deleted his further comment that indigenisation is fine as an industrial policy, but it doesn’t work for advanced weaponry. This is a typically sniffy attitude towards India, which is grist to the mill for the Chandigarh Lobby’s successful efforts to trash local weapons and gain lucrative middleman deals for foreign weapons.

Strategic Dilemma: To Push On or Not

There is also a strategic dilemma. India has an unfortunate habit of wasting its soldiers’ hard-won victories at the negotiating table due to bad political calculations. The epitome of this is, of course, Indira Gandhi’s 1971 giveaway of 93,000 Pakistani PoWs in exchange for essentially… nothing. There is some reason to wonder if something similar happened in 2025 as well. A tactical victory was possibly converted into a stalemate, and the old era of hyphenation and the nuclear bogey has returned.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

What we saw in 2025 was that the Pakistanis were taken by surprise, and India had a massive advantage. But now that the cat is out of the bag, Pakistanis and Chinese will regroup and figure out corrective tactics. Thus India has, to use an American expression, “shot its wad”, and the element of surprise is gone forever.

The endgame for India is the dissolution of Pakistan into four or five statelets, which, one hopes, will then concentrate on Pakistani Punjab as the root of all their troubles. In that case, they will keep each other occupied, and India can live in peace without regular terrorist attacks. Of course, that may be a pipe dream, given the Ghazwa-e-Hind formula many entertain, but the collapse of the Pakistani state is anyway desirable for India.

Should India have continued its offensive? Forget the murky issue of the nuclear assets in Sargodha. Should India have moved the Line of Control (LoC) forward into some areas, perhaps into Gilgit-Baltistan (with Sharda Peeth and the Kishenganga) and up to the Jhelum River in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir? The problem though, is that once you start moving past the border posts, you have hostile civilians to contend with, and your supply lines start getting stretched.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

Even though it is tragic to let go of an opportunity to thrash an enemy that’s on the back foot, and Pakistan will inevitably use the truce to rearm itself and come back ever stronger (the Treaty of Hudaybiyah is not a meme in the Islamic world for nothing), it is not clear to me what India could have done to militarily make the LoC irrelevant and make Pakistan implode, especially in the context of American pushback.

The Role of the US

Why was there pressure from President Trump? One of the things I observed during my US stay is the total absence of DOGE and Elon Musk from the headlines after Trump’s 100 days, very contrary to their ubiquity early on. Similarly, the security implications of Trump’s recent embrace of Syria’s President Al-Sharaa contradict Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard’s views on Syria, as evidenced by her tweets. Further, there are U-turns on tariffs.

This means Trump is being mercurial as ever. Furthermore, there might be something to the idea that his family’s embrace of crypto may have endeared Pakistan – which is making noises about supporting crypto at scale – to him. All this is red-pilling many about Trump. Indeed, he may be allowing short-term, commercial considerations to drive policy, which may return to haunt the US: that is exactly what Clinton, Bush, Obama, et al did with respect to China.

On the other hand, there are longer-term considerations, too. Pakistan is essentially a Potemkin nation, which has no particular reason to exist, other than it is being propped up. Initially, it was a British project for the Russian Great Game; then it was taken over by the US Deep State in order to fend off the Soviet Union. Pakistan was a “major non-NATO ally” (MNNA) according to Obama, if I remember right, and earlier it was a member of CENTO and SEATO.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan to Pakistan, approved in the middle of the hostilities, is not surprising, either: this has happened before. In a way, it is a complicated money-laundering activity. Funds from somewhere (possibly Qatar) are chanelled to Pakistan, which then buys American arms. Thus, the Deep State Military Industrial Complex is the winner.

With the end of the Afghanistan wars, Pakistan offers no obvious geographic and strategic value to the US. Unless, of course, the target is no longer Russia but India. Perhaps in anticipation of its being a check on India, the US had helped Pakistan nuclearise, according to this archived article from the NYTimes: US and China Helped Pakistan Build Its Bomb, from a time when it was possibly more truthful. I am indebted to Brahma Chellaney for this link.

This may suggest that Pakistan’s nuclear ‘assets’ are not theirs but are managed by an American crew. On the other hand, though, the greater possibility is that such assets are loaned by China. Pakistan is a fantastic force multiplier for China.

Abhimanyu Syndrome

The bottom line, then, is that India is on its own: sort of an Abhimanyu Syndrome, with nobody to help. The most obvious ‘friend’ is Japan (because of the China threat), but it is severely constrained by American red lines: see how there was not a murmur from the Quad after Pahalgam. India’s very possible rise is in fact encouraging other powers to put it down: grow so much, but no farther.

There really is no alternative for India but to industrialise, make everything possible for its large internal market, and increase the level of strategic autonomy in everything it makes: no more dependence on third parties, who may feel free to use kill switches or deny spares or components at will. In this round, India did surprisingly well with indigenous technology, and it has articulated a strategy of escalating deterrence. To put teeth into this, innovation at home must continue.

Now, a source close to the veteran actor has broken silence and revealed, “Calling someone like Paresh Rawal, a stalwart with four decades of iconic work, ‘unprofessional’ is not just unfair, it’s laughable. Let’s be clear: the film hadn’t even started.”

It added, “There was a promo shoot, not a film schedule. The real shoot is planned for sometime next year. So, the idea that he ‘walked out’ is just the worst theatrical imagination at best.”

“ Paresh Rawal has returned the signing amount of Rs 11 lakhs with 15% p.a. interest and also a little more money for stepping away from the series,” said a source to Bollywood Hungama.

Priyadarshan, who was supposed to direct Hera Pheri 3 , revealed that Akshay Kumar had tears in his eyes when he came to know about Paresh Rawal’s exit.

“All our contracts were signed. Ten days ago, Suniel, Akshay, and Paresh shot a scene and the IPL [Indian Premier League] teaser. It was only after we unanimously agreed to do Hera Pheri 3 that Akshay bought the franchise’s rights. Akshay had tears in his eyes when he asked me, ‘Priyan, why is Paresh doing this to us?’ Akshay shouldn’t suffer financial losses because Paresh walked out on a whim. I understand that he will have to take whatever action is required,” Priyadarshan told Mid-Day.

Paresh Rawal completes 40 years in Indian cinema this year. But he has had his share of controversies despite being a fine talent. Here are the instances when he made headlines for all the wrong reasons:

Drinking his urine

Paresh Rawal has revealed in an interview with The Lallantop how Ajay Devgn’s father Veeru Devgan asked him to drink his urine for 15 days when he was injured.

The actor said, ‘I did this for 15 days. 15 days later when the doctor took my X-ray, he was shocked. The doctor asked me, ‘How did this cementing happen?’ He could see a white line forming. I was supposed to be discharged in 2-2.5 months, but I was discharged in 1.5 months. It was like magic.’

Rejecting Munna Bhai MBBS

Paresh also shared his strained equation with Vidhu Vinod Chopra, which also made him reject Munna Bhai MBBS ’ role of Dr Asthana (later played by Boman Irani) due to the producer’s arrogance.

“He started ignoring the people he began his career with after achieving success," Paresh shared, adding, “I was supposed to do Munna Bhai. We were discussing remuneration. In my mind, I wanted ₹15 lakh, and coincidentally, Vidhu offered exactly that. But the way he said, ‘I’ll give you ₹15 lakh’ — with arrogance — irked me. So, out of principle, I demanded ₹50 lakh and refused to back down."

Walking out of Hera Pheri 3

Paresh Rawal’s sudden exit from Akshay Kumar and Suniel Shetty starrer Hera Pheri 3 was a huge shocker and disappointment for fans as well as for the fraternity. While there were reports that Akshay Kumar’s Cape of Good Films, the producer of Hera Pheri 3, sued the actor for Rs. 25 crores for his unprofessionalism, the latest report says that Rawal has returned Rs 11 lakhs to the producers with 15% interest.

In a major boost for the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ahead of the playoffs in the ongoing season of the Indian Premier League (IPL), Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood confirmed his availability for the remaining matches of the season.

Hazlewood, who had been recovering from a injury back home, will be available for selection in RCB’s final league match of the season, against Lucknow Super Giants in Lucknow on Tuesday which will be taking place exactly a month since his last appearance for the Rajat Patidar-led franchise.

The 34-year-old’s return is a massive boost for the three-time runners-up in their quest for a maiden IPL title this year, given he is their leading wicket-taker this season and the fourth-highest overall with 18 wickets in 10 matches at an average and economy of 17.27 and 8.44 respectively.

RCB have already qualified for the playoffs and currently occupy the third spot on the points table, having dropped a position following their 42-run defeat at the hands of Sunrisers Hyderabad in Lucknow on Friday.

With Hazlewood back in their attack, Patidar and Co will be hoping to defeat LSG in the 70th and final league match of the season and try and secure a top-two finish – which will give them two attempts at reaching the final.

Hazlewood back just in time for RCB in their quest for a maiden IPL title

Hazlewood’s participation, along with that of Delhi Capitals’ pacer and compatriot Mitchell Starc , was in doubt after the ongoing IPL season was suspended for a week earlier this month due to an armed conflict between India and Pakistan.

Both pacers are expected to play a major role for Australia in the ICC World Test Championship final against South Africa that gets underway at Lord’s on 11 June – eight days after the IPL final as per the revised schedule.

Hazlewood, additionally, had been undergoing rehab for the shoulder issue that forced him to miss RCB’s thrilling victory over fierce rivals Chennai Super Kings at the Chinnaswamy.

However, while Starc has opted against returning to India after returning home following the week-long suspension, Hazlewood has made himself available for the remaining games.

Hazlewood’s RCB teammate Lungi Ngidi has returned to India and had played Friday’s match against the Sunrisers, proving expensive with figures of 1/51. The South African pacer, however, is set to miss the playoffs with the Proteas requiring all of their WTC-bound players to return from the IPL latest by 26 May.

Ahead of Shubman Gill’s maiden assignment as India Test skipper in the form of a five-match series in England next month, we take a look at the two individuals who have played a key role in his cricketing journey. read more

The suspense surrounding the next Indian Test captain is over with top-order batter Shubman Gill being named as Rohit Sharma’s successor on Saturday, with Rishabh Pant as his deputy. Gill was a front-runner for succeeding the ‘Hitman’ ever since the latter announced his retirement from Test cricket on 7 May, with senior pacer Jasprit Bumrah – who was originally expected to take over as skipper – not being considered due to his recent back injury along with workload issues.

Gill, who had played in the 2018 U-19 World Cup under Prithvi Shaw’s leadership, has been one of India’s top young stars since making his debut during the tour of New Zealand in January 2019. And even before he was named Gujarat Titans skipper after all-rounder Hardik Pandya left for Mumbai Indians in late 2023, Gill was seen as someone who would lead the national team someday.

How Gill’s father and Yuvraj Singh shaped Gill’s career

Looking back at the 25-year-old’s life and cricketing journey so far, there are two individuals who stand out as far as shaping skills in the sport – his father Lakhwinder and legendary all-rounder Yuvraj Singh.

Lakhwinder, a farmer, had aspirations of becoming a professional cricketer himself, but could not fulfill that dream of his. He, therefore, ensured his son would not miss out on becoming a cricketer and representing the country one day, shifting base to Mohali from a village located in Punjab’s Fazilka district located near the India-Pakistan border, where cricketing facilities were limited.

Besides ensuring Shubman got better training by moving close to the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, Lakhwinder and his wife Keart dedicated themselves to fulfilling his cricketing journey, with the former bowling between 500 to 700 balls a day in order to hone his batting skills.

The Gill family ended up missing several family functions including marriage invitations in their quest to make Shubman, who has an elder sister Shahneel, a world-class cricketer.

Also helping Shubman realise his dream of representing the Men in Blue was former India cricketer Yuvraj, who is also credited with mentoring his close friend and Punjab teammate Abhishek Sharma – who had played in the same 2018 U-19 World Cup as Gill, Shaw and Arshdeep Singh.

“The credit for Shubman Gill’s performance goes to his father and Yuvraj Singh,” Yuvraj’s father Yograj, himself a former India cricketer, told Asian News International.

“If Shubman Gill has become the captain today and will stay for a long time, Yuvraj Singh’s guidance will play and has played an essential role in that.

“Someone like Yuvraj Singh, the greatest cricketing brain in the world, taking Gill under his wing is a big thing,” he added.

While Shubman has been named Test captain, he is also a strong candidate to succeed Rohit as skipper in ODIs – the only format that the ‘Hitman’ and Kohli currently are active in after retiring from Tests and T20Is.

Senior batter Suryakumar Yadav currently leads India in the shortest format and is expected to continue in the role for at least a couple of more years, beyond which there could be a scenario where Gill becomes all-formats captain.

Back to back outages at X come after a major fire broke out at the company’s data centre in Hillsboro, Oregon on Thursday. It is not clear whether both developments are related read more

Elon Musk-owned microblogging website X suffered another outage on Saturday (May 24), just a day after the company acknowledged “a data centre outage” on Friday and blamed it for service disruption across the world.

Downdetector showed a spike in outages around 6 pm IST.

Thousands of users across the globe reported facing problems accessing various parts of the site, including the homepage, app interface, and login services.

Some users also reported seeing blank timelines.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

X has not released any statement regarding the fresh outage, but said Friday that it encountered some data centre-related issues, shortly after users reported disruption.

“X is aware some of our users are experiencing performance issues on the platform today. We are experiencing a data centre outage and the team is actively working to remediate the issue,” wrote X’s engineering account on May 23.

Fire incident at X’s data centre

Back to back outages at X come as news outlet Wired reported Friday that a major fire broke out at X’s data centre in Hillsboro, Oregon on Thursday.

The outlet quoted multiple sources as saying that the fire led to an extended response from emergency crew.

The crew reportedly found a room with batteries that were deemed to be involved in the fire

However, it was not clear whether server operations were hampered by the incident or not.

Cost-cutting leading to frequent outages?

Before Elon Musk bought X (formerly Twitter), the company had three data centres located in Sacramento, Portland, and Atlanta. This setup meant that if one data centre failed, traffic could be directed to the other two, preventing any single data centre from being overwhelmed.

Around Christmas Eve 2022, Musk decided to shut down the Sacramento data centre to save money. This led to a significant outage for the company. Over the following six months, the company relocated over 2,573 server racks from Sacramento to the data centres in Portland and Atlanta, according to internal documents.

In the Portland area, X appears to lease space in a building associated with Digital Realty, one of the largest data centre developers globally.

Digital Realty offers different levels of operational support at its sites, which can host one or more tenants. It is unclear if X shares this facility with other companies.

China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year read more

Nvidia will roll out a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a substantially cheaper price than its recently limited H20 model, with mass production slated to begin as early as June, according to individuals familiar with the situation.

According to two sources, the GPU, or graphics processing unit, will be included in Nvidia’s current generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is estimated to cost between $6,500 and $8,000, which is far less than the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

The reduced price reflects the weaker specs and easier production needs.

It will be built on Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor, and will use standard GDDR7 memory rather than more sophisticated high bandwidth memory, according to the two sources.

They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.

The new chip’s price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported.

The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media.

An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its “limited” options. “Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the US government, we are effectively foreclosed from China’s $50 billion data center market.”

TSMC declined to comment.

Market share plunge

China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. It’s the third time that Nvidia has had to tailor a GPU for the world’s second-largest economy after restrictions from US authorities who are keen to stymie Chinese technological development.

After the US effectively banned the H20 in April, Nvidia initially considered developing a downgraded version of the H20 for China, sources have said, but that plan didn’t work out.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week the company’s older Hopper architecture - which the H20 uses - can no longer accommodate further modifications under current US export restrictions.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

Reuters was unable to determine the product’s final name.

Chinese brokerage GF Securities said in a note published on Tuesday that the new GPU would likely be called the 6000D or the B40, though it did not disclose pricing or cite sources for the information.

According to two of the sources, Nvidia is also developing another Blackwell-architecture chip for China that is set to begin production as early as September. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm specifications of that variant.

Nvidia’s market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when US export curbs that impacted its products began, to 50% currently, Huang told reporters in Taipei this week. Its main competitor is Huawei which produces the Ascend 910B chip.

Huang also warned that if US export curbs continue, more Chinese customers will buy Huawei’s chips.

The H20 ban forced Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in inventory and Huang told the Stratechery podcast on Monday that the company also had to walk away from $15 billion in sales.

The latest export restrictions introduced new limits on GPU memory bandwidth - a crucial metric measuring data transmission speeds between the main processor and memory chips. This capability is particularly important for AI workloads that require extensive data processing.

Investment bank Jefferies estimates that the new regulations cap memory bandwidth at 1.7-1.8 terabytes per second. That compares with the 4 terabytes per second that the H20 is capable of.

GF Securities forecast the new GPU will achieve approximately 1.7 terabytes per second using GDDR7 memory technology, just within the export control limits.

The final day of the 2024-25 Premier League season is going to be an intense race for the last three UEFA Champions League spots. Manchester City, Newcastle, Chelsea, Aston Villa, and Nottingham Forest will battle it out as Liverpool, Arsenal, and Tottenham have already qualified. Find out what each team needs to qualify. read more

The 2024-25 season of the English Premier League is coming to an end this Sunday with only one game left for each side. While the title and relegation are already decided, the race for the top five is still alive and it is going down to the wire. Five English clubs will qualify for the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League instead of the usual four.

The Premier League earned one extra place this year thanks to the strong performance of English clubs in European tournaments. That means five teams from the league table will go to the UCL. Liverpool and Arsenal have already qualified, and three places are still up for grabs.

Who is still fighting for UCL spots?

Five teams are currently in the race for the remaining three spots in the Champions League from England. Manchester City, Newcastle United, Chelsea, Aston Villa, and Nottingham Forest are the teams still alive. These teams are separated by just three points in the battle for the remaining UCL places.

What each team needs to qualify?

Manchester City: Just 1 point will confirm UCL spot for them. Even if they lose, they will likely still make it due to a much better goal difference than Villa.

Newcastle United: A win will help them secure a UCL place. A draw will also do if Chelsea and Villa don’t win. If they lose and still want to qualify, then Villa must also go down.

Chelsea: A win will make UCL qualification very likely. A draw will leave them depending on other results. If they lose, their only hope is that both Villa and Newcastle also lose.

Aston Villa: They need a win and for at least one of Chelsea, Newcastle, or Manchester City to drop points. A draw or loss would leave them with only a slim chance or eliminate them entirely.

Nottingham Forest: Must win and hope other results go their way to have any chance of UCL qualification. They especially need Chelsea to drop points.

McLaren’s Lando Norris broke the Monaco lap record to claim pole position ahead of Charles Leclerc and Oscar Piastri, ending his qualifying struggles. read more

MONACO: Lando Norris beat the Monaco track record, his main Formula 1 rival and a local hero to take pole position on Saturday.

Perhaps most importantly, Norris made a breakthrough in his own struggles with F1 qualifying, which have hampered his championship chances against McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri.

“It’s been a long time coming,” said Norris, who hadn’t been on pole since the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.

“I don’t think I’ve ever doubted what I can do. Of course, I’ve got frustrated, I’ve been unhappy, because that’s normal," Norris added. “If you don’t win, if you don’t get pole, you’re not going to be happy, especially when it’s where you should be, it’s what the objective is.”

Norris and Monaco local Charles Leclerc swapped the fastest times before Norris upped the pace again to take first by .109 of a second. Piastri was third.

Norris’ time of 1 minute, 9.954 seconds replaced a record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2019.

It comes as Norris tries to cut into Piastri’s 13-point standings lead and follows weeks of frustration in qualifying — sometimes from small mistakes, but also a dramatic crash in Saudi Arabia last month. Leclerc, who won the Monaco GP last year, was denied a fourth career pole at his home race.

Leclerc said Monaco’s slow and twisty layout allowed Ferrari to dodge some of the “compromises” it’s had to make with its setup at more varied tracks.

Defending champion Max Verstappen, the winner of the Emilia-Romagna GP last week, was fifth for Red Bull after predicting Monaco’s low-speed nature wouldn’t suit his car, but starts fourth because of a penalty for Lewis Hamilton.

Qualifying has typically been more important at Monaco than anywhere else on the F1 calendar. It’s almost impossible to overtake on the narrow streets so grid position is vital.

It could be a little different this time because drivers will be required to change tires at least twice during the race.

“I don’t think anyone really knows what to expect,” Piastri said.

That rule change follows a dull race last year when an early red flag allowed all drivers to make their mandatory pit stop. The race finished with the top 10 all in the same order that they started the race.

A radio mix-up cost seven-time world champion Hamilton, as he was dropped from fourth to seventh on the grid for getting in Verstappen’s way.

In the first part of qualifying, Hamilton was told by the Ferrari team that Verstappen was on a slower lap, when the Dutch driver was actually trying to set a competitive time.

Hamilton was obliged to make way for the faster car, but the miscommunication meant the British driver was in Verstappen’s way on the racing line, landing him a three-place grid penalty for impeding.

Until then, Hamilton’s fourth place seemed a strong recovery following a crash in practice which required a major rebuild of his Ferrari.

It was a session to forget for Mercedes as its cars caused two red flags.

George Russell is set to start 14th after his car broke down in the tunnel with a suspected electrical problem, causing a lengthy stoppage while it was pushed out of the way by a track marshal crew. His 18-year-old teammate Kimi Antonelli hit the wall and was 15th.

Haas rookie Oliver Bearman qualified 17th but dropped to the back of the grid because of a 10-place penalty imposed on Friday for overtaking under red flags when practice was stopped.

Stina Blackstenius scored in the 75th minute after being set up by fellow second-half substitute Beth Mead Estádio José Alvalade in Lisbon on Saturday.

Arsenal’s title came 18 years after it became the first — and still the only — English club to win the top club title in women’s soccer.

Arsenal’s players embraced on the final whistle and ran to celebrate in front of the red-and-white corner of the stands otherwise mostly dressed in burgundy-and-blue.

“We believed from the moment our Champions League journey started,” Arsenal striker Alessia Russo told broadcaster TNT Sports.

“We knew that we had the capabilities. We knew that we could be good enough. It was just about going and doing it. And we’ve done it!” Barcelona was considered the heavy favorite. It was aiming for a fourth title in five years and to become the only team other than Lyon to win three consecutive titles. The team led by two-time Ballon d’Or winners Aitana Bonmatí and Alexia Putellas won nine straight in the competition and blew out Wolfsburg and English champion Chelsea in the knockout rounds.

But Arsenal locked down in defense — except for early in the second half — and created the best chances. Only two superb saves by Barcelona goalkeeper Cata Coll to deny Frida Maanum and Blackstenius kept it scoreless until Blackstenius finally beat her.

The victory marks an incredible finish to a rocky season for Arsenal, which included coach Jonas Eidevall resigning and being replaced by assistant Renée Seglers.

Since taking over, Seglers steered the team through a spectacular European campaign. Arsenal built its confidence from come-from-behind wins over Real Madrid and eight-time champion Lyon in the knockout rounds before laying low the almighty Barcelona.

The loss was a huge disappointment for the large group of Barcelona fans who filled the stadium that is home to Sporting Lisbon. Blue-and-burgundy shirts and flags outnumbered the red-and-white section, but their calls of “Yes we can!” in the final minutes weren’t enough to inspire a comeback by the Catalan club.

The closest Barcelona came to a goal was a shot by Claudia Pina that hit the crossbar just after halftime when the Spanish team had its best period. Otherwise, the game was to Arsenal’s liking.

“We are very sorry for all our fans who have come to support us,” Bonmatí told Catalunya Radio in the field before the award ceremony. “We will try to do it again.” Arsenal imposes its game Arsenal shook off some early jitters in defense and soon had Barcelona on the back foot. Its pressure up the field stopped Barcelona from getting its possession game going, and Arsenal found spaces with long balls down the left flank.

England striker Russo was a rock for Arsenal, using her size to win balls and keep the attack going.

Arsenal thought it went ahead in the 22nd but a video review waived off an own goal by Barcelona’s Irene Paredes when the referee spotted an offside by Frida Maanum. Maanum then went close with a long shot in the 27th that Coll did well to stretch and push over her bar.

Bonmatí was the only Barcelona player who seemed to be in the flow before halftime. Her dribble moves through the middle created a few threats and kept Arsenal on guard in defense. Leah Willamson blocked her best shot deep in the box in the 12th.

Barcelona came out of the restart firing.

Pina hit the woodwork with her chipped shot from a sharp angle in the 49th. Bonmatí forced goalie Daphne van Domselaar to get low to parry her shot, and Ona Battle bombarded the area with three shots from long range.

But Blackstenius set the tone when she had a golden chance when she stole a ball with only Cata to beat, but the goalie got her leg out to block her effort in the 72nd. The Sweden forward would not be denied a second time.

The 2025 Union Budget is in the books.

Many, particularly the middle and salaried class, have reasons to rejoice after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveiled the Budget today (February 1).

However, others do not.

So, who were the winners and losers of the 2025 Union Budget?

Let’s take a closer look:

The winners

Middle class

The middle class, which had been praying for relief, was arguably the biggest winner of the Union Budget.

This, after Sitharaman announced that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh would pay no tax under the new regime.

Sitharaman also tweaked the tax slabs.

Sitharaman said her Budget was aimed at ‘unlocking greater prosperity.’

Sitharaman also raised the tax return filing limit from 2 years to four years and increased the limit for tax deduction on interest for senior citizens to Rs 1 lakh.

Bloomberg quoted Sitharaman as saying that these changes would deprive the Indian exchequer of Rs 1 lakh crore.

Farmers, MSMEs

Arguably the second-biggest winner was farmers and MSMEs.

Sitharaman showered sops on cultivators.

She said the Pradhan Mantri Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana – a partnership between the Centre and states – will be launched in 100 underperforming districts to improve.

Sitharaman said the scheme would assist around 1.7 crore farmers.

Sitharaman said that Kisan Credit Cards would continue to help farmers, fishermen and dairy farmers across India.

Nirmala Sitharaman announced a slew of schemes to benefit farmers. PTI

Sitharaman said the limit for short-term loans would be increased from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh and that the scheme would help 7.7 crore farmers.

She also announced Mission for Pulses Self-Reliance – a six-year scheme that would raise productivity, producing climate-resilient seeds, and boosting farmer income.

Sitharaman announced the formation of a Rural Prosperity and Resilience Programme – which would focus on rural women, young farmers, rural youth, marginal and small farmers, and landless families.

Ease of Doing Business, startups

Sitharaman announced a slew of changes to improve Ease of Doing Business (EODB).

This includes raising the FDI in insurance for firms which invest entire premium in India from 74 to 100 per cent, the formation of a new KYC registry and faster approvals for company mergers.

Sitharaman also said a Investment Friendliness Index for states would be brought in.

Experts praised the move to raise FDI.

“This move is likely to attract substantial foreign capital while also fostering innovation and improving service quality through technological advancements. As a result, global insurance companies can now invest fully, and we anticipate the emergence of innovative products and services tailored to meet the diverse needs of Indian consumers,” said Sharad Mathur, Managing Director and CEO, Universal Sompo General Insurance told LiveMint

As per The Times of India, Sitharaman also announced the formation of a Rs 100 billion fund to promote start-ups.

The scheme will offer first-time entrepreneurs, particularly women, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes, loans of up to Rs 2 crore.

Bihar

Sitharaman, wearing a Madhubani saree made in Bihar’s Mithila, announced several projects for Bihar ahead of this year’s Assembly polls.

Among other things, Sitharaman announced the setting up of a Makhana board, a National Institute of Food Technology, Entrepreneurship and Management, the expansion of the Patna airport a new brownfield airport.

She also announced support for the Western Kosi Canal ERM project in Bihar’s Mithilanchal region – which would help farmers cultivating around 50,000 hectares of land.

The BJP is in alliance with the ruling JD(U) of Nitish Kumar in Bihar – where polls are due later this year.

Losers

India Inc and HNIs

India Inc found little to cheer in this budget.

As per The Times of India, there were no major tax cuts or incentives provided to MNCs.

“While MSMEs received some attention, large industries and multinational corporations saw limited direct benefits, with no major corporate tax cuts or regulatory relaxations to boost competitiveness,” the piece noted.

While there was relief for the middle class and the salaried, high net worth individuals also had no cause to celebrate.

Those earning above Rs 24 lakh continue to pay 30 per cent as tax.

Railways

The Indian Railways was allotted Rs 2.55 lakh crore in the Union Budget.

However, that figure was at Rs 2.62 lakh crore in the previous fiscal.

The Times of India noted that this comes despite hopes that the government would modernize the railways.

It noted that this would likely slow down the pace of expansion projects and affect key stakeholders.

Healthcare

Sitharaman made a few announcements on healthcare.

These included the establishing of 200 day care cancer centres in district hospitals, ten thousand new seats in medical institutions by 2025-2026, 50,000 new labs in government schools and broadband to rural secondary schools and primary health centres.

However, these proposals did not seem to find favour with the markets.

Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcements on healthcare did not seem to gain approval of the markets.

As per Bloomberg, India is among the lowest spending countries on healthcare around the world.

India spends around 3.3 per cent of its GDP on healthcare.

China, meanwhile, spends 5.4 per cent on healthcare.

The United States, meanwhile, spends a whopping 16 per cent of its GDP on healthcare.

Environment

Those who care for the environment found little to cheer.

Sitharaman announced a Clean Tech Manufacturing scheme and that incentives for EV batteries, solar PV cells, and wind turbines under this programme.

However, there was no ‘big bang’ reform to be found.

With inputs from agencies

While Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the 2025-26 budget only heard the voices of Indians, what she left unsaid was that the budget also provided the road map to navigate through Trump’s tariff threats and other global challenges read more

The tariff threats from US President Donald Trump seemed to have some sort of impact on India’s 2025-2026 Union Budget. On Saturday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled her 8th consecutive budget, creating a history of its own kind. During the speech, Sitharaman mentioned that India continues to remain the fastest-growing economy in comparison to all major economies in the world.

One of the significant aspects of the budget was that it proposed measures that were focused on making the Indian economy robust amid uncertainties that are playing out around the world. After winning the 2024 US presidential elections, Trump has been threatening tariffs on several nations and international blocs.

Trump has often threatened high tariffs against BRICS nations, which also comprise India. New Delhi has been trying to preemptively lower tariffs on goods to save itself from Trump’s threats. When asked whether Trump’s warnings had any impact on the budget especially the drastic changes in income tax slabs, Sitharaman made it clear that the voices of the people were the budget’s priority.

“We responded to the voice of the people, and therefore, we have given this (income tax relief),” Sitharaman replied. Despite her dismissal, the word “tariff” was mentioned 64 times in her speech. If we compare it to her July budget speech, the word was mentioned only 10 times. However, it would be wrong to assess this theory by just accounting for the number of times the word was mentioned in both budgets. The 2025 budget can also be seen as paving the path for India to cope with possible global challenges.

Export Promotion Mission

In the 2025 Budget, Sitharaman proposed the Export Promotion Mission, which will be jointly driven by the Ministries of Commerce, MSME, and Finance. The initiative aims to provide easy access to export credit, cross-border factoring support, and support to MSMEs to tackle non-tariff measures in overseas markets.

The mission will not only provide support to the manufacturing sector but will also give them incentives to expand their presence in the international market. “Support will be provided to develop domestic manufacturing capacities for our economy’s integration with global supply chains. Sectors will be identified based on objective criteria,” Sitharaman said.

“Facilitation groups with the participation of senior officers and industry representatives will be formed for select products and supply chains,” she added. This protects the manufacturers in case they struggle to sell their goods abroad. This also enables India to diversify its supply chains.

Easing custom tariffs

As a part of the comprehensive review of the Customs rate structure which was announced in the July 2024 Budget, Sitharaman proposed the removal of seven tariff rates. “After this, there will be only eight remaining tariff rates including the ‘zero’ rate,” she said.

Trump has often complained that India’s import tariffs are extremely high. Before meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019, Trump complained about the high import tariffs on the iconic Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

“We’re not the foolish country that does so badly. You look at India, a very good friend of mine, Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi, you take a look at what they’ve done, 100 per cent tax on a motorcycle. We charge them nothing,” he said.

Even last year, when Trump was running for office, he reiterated his stance on the matter. “The other thing I want to have is a matching tax where, if India charges us – India is very big with tariffs. I mean, I saw it with Harley-Davidson. I was saying, how do you do in a place like India? Oh, no, good sir. Why? They have 100 per cent and 150 per cent and 200 per cent tariffs,” the president told Fox News. Hence, India would like to avoid such situation.

Navigating through the H1-B crisis

While Trump said that his administration is not looking to deport skilled, legal workers, his supporters have called for imposing curbs on the issuance of H1-B visas. If that situation occurs, the Union Budget gives ways to absorb people affected by it. The budget called for the expansion of Domestic hiring models to mitigate the negative impacts of such limitations.

Meanwhile, if Trump’s policies force Indian firms to seek new markets, the government also plans to provide tax relief and incentives for companies who are looking to expand operations both locally and internationally.

Other ways India plans to navigate the Trump-era

On Thursday, Trump reiterated his warning to impose tariffs against BRICS nations if they move forward with their dream to de-dollarise. Amid these warnings, the Ministry of External Affairs announced on Friday, that Prime Minister Modi will be travelling to the United States this month, where he will hold talks with Trump.

Earlier this month, it was reported that India is already willing to offer more incentives, such as tax cuts and land access to American companies. Not only this but in recent years, India has put a special focus on developing the semiconductors and electronics sectors.

The sectors New Delhi will largely focus on in this regard include, components for mobile phone assembly such as printed circuit board assembly, parts of camera modules, and USB cables, Reuters reported.

In a significant move, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Union Budget 2025, has provided much-needed relief and recognition to India’s growing gig economy.

In a significant move, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Union Budget 2025, has brought much-needed relief and recognition to India’s growing gig economy.

With the workforce rapidly expanding, the government’s latest initiative aims to formalise the sector and empower millions of independent workers across the country through social security benefits and facilitating their access to healthcare.

Here’s what the Budget has in store for the gig workers.

A brief look at India’s gig economy

India’s gig economy has been expanding at an unprecedented pace, with millions of workers entering the sector in recent years.

According to estimates from TeamLease, over 85 per cent of India’s workforce operates in the informal sector, with a significant portion comprising gig workers.

Currently, India has around 10 million gig workers, of which nearly 7 million are engaged in last-mile delivery on bikes. This is significantly higher than the NITI Aayog estimate of 7.7 million in 2021.

With the boom in quick commerce platforms like Zepto, Blinkit, and Instamart, along with the rapid expansion of cab service platforms like Ola and Uber and food aggregators such as Swiggy and Zomato, the demand for gig workers has jumped massively. Zomato alone had 1.5 million delivery partners fulfilling orders in 2024.

As per NITI Aayog, the gig workforce is projected to triple to 23.5 million by 2029-30. However, given the rapid expansion of the digital economy in India, the actual number could far exceed these estimates.

With their rising numbers, gig workers can potentially play a crucial role in keeping the economy running. According to a white paper by the Forum for Progressive Gig Workers, cited by CNBC, the gig economy market will grow at a 17 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to reach a gross volume of $455 billion by 2024.

Moreover, it has the potential to contribute 1.25 per cent to India’s GDP by 2030 and generate 90 million jobs in the long run.

However, despite its scale and importance, gig workers are not formally part of a company, meaning they are not entitled to social security benefits like insurance, gratuity, or paid leave like other on-roll employees.

While companies like Swiggy and Zomato provide insurance support for their gig workforce, many freelance and contractual workers who are not affiliated with a major brand remain unprotected. Moreover, many of their jobs require them to spend long hours on the road, often under tight deadlines, making them vulnerable to accidents and financial instability.

This lack of structured benefits and protections remains one of the biggest challenges in the gig economy and the Budget 2025 has something that can prove to be a step in the right direction.

What did Budget 2025 bring for gig workers?

In a major step towards improving the welfare of gig workers, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a Social Security Scheme in her Budget 2025 speech.

A key highlight of this initiative is the inclusion of gig workers under the government’s flagship health insurance programme, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY).

This scheme, currently implemented by the National Health Authority (NHA), provides health coverage of Rs 5 lakh per family per year. It is the world’s largest health insurance programme, offering benefits without any waiting period or restrictions on pre-existing health conditions.

The initiative, which is expected to benefit nearly 10 million (1 crore) gig workers, said Sitharaman.

Shefali Goradia, Chairperson of Deloitte South Asia told Times Now that this new measure will bring about “inclusive development”.

“Prioritising sustainable growth, innovation, and green energy solutions and measures such as social security scheme for gig workers, setting up of digital public infrastructure network and moving the further growth in GCCs to Tier II cities show, that the government is willing to walk the talk on democratisation of the economy,” Goradia added.

ID cards on e-Shram

Sitharaman further announced that the government will arrange ID cards for the gig workforce on the e-Shram portal.

An online portal, managed by the Labour Ministry, e-Shram serves as a national database for unorganised workers, making it easier for gig workers to register and access government welfare schemes. The introduction of ID cards is expected to further formalise their status, ensuring they receive the benefits they are entitled to.

Madhav Krishna, founder and chief executive of Vahan.ai, of a Bengaluru-based blue-collar recruitment platform, told Live Mint that “the issuance of identity cards will give gig work the status of actual jobs. So far, gig work has been seen as temporary and mainly for side income. Food and grocery delivery platforms, e-commerce companies, and logistics firms will see massive benefits as formalisation kicks in.”

Balasubramanian Anantha Narayanan, senior vice president at recruitment platform Teamlease Services Limited also told the news outlet that, “officially recognising and formalising the gig economy is a step in the right direction."

Additionally, the Finance Minister introduced a dedicated social security scheme for online platform workers, which will be implemented through a public-private partnership (PPP) model. “States will be encouraged to adopt this model and can seek assistance from the India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) scheme to prepare PPP proposals,” Sitharaman stated.

While these initiatives mark a crucial step forward, challenges remain. The Code on Social Security, enacted by Parliament in 2020, lays out a framework for social security measures for gig workers, including accidental cover, health and maternity benefits, pension, and life and disability insurance. However, the code has yet to be implemented. How these new measures will impact the unorganised sector in the long run remains to be seen.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Union Budget for the financial year 2025-2026 in Parliament on Saturday.

This was the first complete budget of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 3.0 government and her eighth consecutive budget, setting a record.

The Budget focused on women, farmers, education, and youth.

She announced major initiatives, and changes to the existing tax slabs in the new regime, ensuring relief to the middle class.

Here’s a quick look at key takeaways from the Union Budget 2025:

A new Fund of Funds Scheme (FFS) with a capital of Rs 10,000 crore was unveiled by the government on Saturday in an effort to support the development of aspiring business owners in the nation. The government introduced a similar scheme in 2016 as well, with contributions distributed throughout the 14th and 15th cycles of the Finance Commission and a corpus of Rs 10,000 crore.

The government plans to set up a urea plant in Assam to further augment urea supply to farmers. Sitharaman, while presenting the Budget, said, “The plant with an annual capacity of 12.7 lakh metric tonnes will be set up at Namrup in Assam. Three dormant urea plants in the Eastern region have been reopened.”

The Centre said on February 1 that 10,000 seats would be added to hospitals and medical schools the following year. Within the next five years, the government wants to add 75,000 seats.

Additionally, Sitharaman announced that the credit guarantee cover for MSMEs (micro, small, and medium-sized businesses) would be increased from Rs 5 crore to Rs 10 crore. Additionally, term loans of up to Rs 20 crore will be made available to well-managed exporter MSMEs.Additionally, the government intends to launch microbusiness-specific credit cards.

Moreover, Sitharaman stated that within a decade, 120 new destinations will be added to the new UDAN plan. The government has allocated Rs 540 crore for the plan in the FY26 budget, which is less than the revised estimate of Rs 800 crore but marginally more than the Rs 502 crore (BE FY25) announced in July 2024.

India will set up a Rs 250 billion or Rs 25,000 crore maritime development fund for the long-term financing of the country’s shipbuilding and repair industry. Jal Jeevan Mission, which aims to provide tap water connection to all rural households, has been extended till 2028 with an enhanced Budget outlay.

This is probably one of the biggest announcements of the Budget speech.

Under the new system, those earning up to Rs 12 lakh would not be required to pay any income tax, according to Sitharaman.The standard deduction of Rs 75,000 is not included in this. Additionally, she increased the two-year tax return filing maximum to four years.

The slabs have changed under the new tax system, which Sitharaman initially implemented in 2020. They will now be:

The old tax regime remains unchanged.

The Centre introduced the Bharatiya Bhasha Pustak Scheme, a fresh initiative designed to increase accessibility to education by providing study guides and digital textbooks in a number of Indian languages.

Over the next three years, the government will also help every district hospital create daycare cancer centres, with 200 of these to be built in 2025–2026.

The Budget also included a scheme that focuses on the development of clusters, skills, and a manufacturing ecosystem that will create high-quality, unique, innovative, and sustainable toys that will represent the ‘Made in India’ brand.

The Centre will establish a National Institute Of Food Technology, Entrepreneurship, and Management in Bihar.

“The Institute will provide a strong fillip to food processing activities in the entire eastern region. This will result in, one, enhanced income for the farmers through value addition to their produce, and two, skilling entrepreneurship and employment opportunities for the youth," Sitharaman said.

The 2025 Budget has announced the setting up of five National Centres of Excellence for Skilling and Centre of Excellence for artificial intelligence (AI) for education with an outlay of Rs 500 crore.

After Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to make income up to Rs 12 lakh tax-free in the Budget 2025-26, among other measures, experts said it was a pro-growth budget that sought to focus on wealth creation for the middle class with eyes on triggering consumption-led growth read more

With an eye on the middle class, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed an overhaul of income tax in the Budget 2024-25.

Under Sitharaman’s proposals, income of up to Rs 12 lakh would be tax-free compared to Rs 7.75 lakh at the moment. She also rejigged the income tax slabs, raising the maximum bracket of 30 per cent tax to income above Rs 30 lakh from Rs 15 lakh at the moment.

Along with other proposals in the Budget, such as the rationalisation of tax deducted at source (TDS) and tax collected at source (TCS) regimes, Sitharaman’s proposals go towards addressing the concerns of the middle class, incentivising consumption-led growth, and putting more money in the hands of people, according to experts.

Manish Goel, Founder and Managing Director of Equentis Wealth Advisory Services, said that disposable incomes are set to go up with Sitharaman’s tax cut that would drive consumption and savings.

When taken along with other proposals for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), Goel said that Sitharaman has come up with a “pro-growth” budget.

Goel said, “The rationalisation of tax slabs and compliance relief further eases financial planning, making this budget a major step toward a more taxpayer-friendly system. Beyond tax relief, the budget supports long-term wealth creation through pro-growth policies, infrastructure investments, and MSME incentives. The Rs 10,000 crore Alternate Investment Fund (AIF) for startups and higher MSME credit limits aim to boost entrepreneurship and job creation, fostering an environment where individuals can benefit from expanding economic opportunities.”

With such policies, the budget has a “clear focus on wealth creation, savings, and ease of doing business makes this a transformative budget for individuals and investors alike”, said Goel.

It has been estimated that Sitharaman’s tax cuts could boost consumption and revive the GDP growth. In an analysis on X, Krishnamurthy V Subramanian, an Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said that tax cuts could boost consumption by up to 10 per cent and that could further take the economic growth to 8 per cent. The estimate comes at a time when India’s economic growth has slowed to a four-year low at 6.4 per cent.

Even though experts are counting on consumption-led growth, Promod Batra, a partner at Deloitte India, highlighted that the usage of increased disposable income would not be uniform.

“The new tax provisions are likely to have a more pronounced impact on rural and lower-income groups. This segment tends to channel 80–90 per cent of their additional income directly into consumption, amplifying the economic multiplier effect. In contrast, middle and higher-income groups may not exhibit the same consumption boost, as demand for goods and services is relatively less or not directly proportional and often directed towards savings or investments rather than immediate spending,” said Batra.

Not everyone, however, agrees with the view that the likes of IMF’s Subramanian have taken. The critics have said that revenue foregone because of tax cuts —Sitharaman said Rs 1 lakh crore in direct taxes and Rs 2,600 crore in indirect taxes will be forgone— would result in less money with the government for capital expenditure that would slow developmental activities and have a negative effect on growth.

In a post-budget press conference, Sitharaman sought to address the concern. She said that there would not be any adverse effect on capital expenditure — even though she did not go into the specifics.

“There is no reduction in the public spending on capital expenditure. We continue to place emphasis on the multiplier effect that capital expenditure done by government has shown has sustained us. We continue on that, and with all this, our fiscal prudence has been maintained,” said Sitharaman.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s eighth Union Budget 2025 focused on easing some financial worries of senior citizens.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented her eighth consecutive Union Budget in Parliament on Saturday (February 1).

From changes to income tax slabs to major initiatives like IITs and medical colleges, she made major announcements for women, farmers, education, and startups.

The Budget 2025 not only focused on youth but also on easing elderly people’s financial woes.

Doubled TDS on interest income

This is a big one.

Sitharaman has suggested doubling the tax deduction at source (TDS) cap on income interest for senior citizens.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

“The limit for tax deduction on interest for senior citizens is being doubled from the present Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh,” she said in the Lower House.

The move will enable retirees to retain a larger portion of their hard-earned money in fixed deposits and other savings plans.

The TDS threshold for others has been raised from the current Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000.

Simplified TDS rules

The rationalisation of TDS rates is another significant change.

The annual rental income threshold for TDS has been raised from Rs 2.4 lakh to Rs 6 lakh.

As a result, many elderly people who depend on rental income may be able to avoid TDS deductions, which will make paying their taxes easier.

Sandeep Chilana, Managing Partner, CCLaw, was quoted by India Today, “The increase in the TDS threshold for various payments is a welcome move to ease the compliance burden on smaller businesses and individuals.”

FM Nirmala Sitharaman meets with the press following the Budget 2025 presentation.

NSS withdrawals

Additionally, withdrawals from NSS accounts made on or after August 2024 will not be subject to taxes, according to the Union Budget.

“A number of senior and very senior citizens have very old National Savings Scheme accounts. As interest is no longer payable on such accounts, I propose to exempt withdrawals made from NSS by individuals on or after August 29, 2024,” she said.

Many senior citizens still have accounts in such initiatives, even though they were discontinued a long time ago.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD

These accounts will pay no interest beginning October 1, 2024, but seniors will be able to withdraw money without incurring penalties, giving them access to their money without any additional fees or limitations.

Note that this only applies to NSS-87 and NSS-92. The National Savings Certificate (NSC), another widely used savings plan, is unchanged, according to CNBC-TV18.

A boost to NPS Vatsalya

Treating ordinary National Pension System (NPS) accounts and NPS Vatsalya accounts equally is a significant development in the pension sector.

With this budget plan, NPS Vatsalya, which was created especially for elderly persons to give them a solid retirement corpus, will now enjoy the same tax benefits as standard NPS accounts, subject to overall contribution caps.

Seniors, especially those without pension coverage, ought to benefit from this change, as it will enable them to accumulate retirement savings that will yield consistent income once they retire, so creating a more secure future.

The Atal Vayo Abhyuday Yojana (AVYAY), which offers older citizens welfare, has received a budget of Rs 289.69 crore.

According to several media reports, the new income tax bill will be tabled in Parliament today (February 13).

The idea behind the new bill is to simplify taxation laws – currently governed by the Income Tax Act, 1961 – for the common man.

The 1961 Act, which deals with personal tax, corporate tax securities, gifts, and wealth, has nearly two dozen chapters and 298 sections.

It originally had 800 pages when it was introduced.

The new law is set to take effect from April 1, 1996.

But how will the Income Tax Bill, 2025, help you?

Let’s take a closer look:

How will it help?

First, let’s take a brief look at the bill.

The bill comprises 536 sections, 23 chapters and 16 schedules.

Though the bill increases the number of schedules to 16 from 14, it keeps the number of chapters at 23.

However, it reduces the number of pages to 622 – nearly half of the current Act.

As per Indian Express, the new income tax bill makes the language of the law simpler.

It also removes stipulations and explanations – thus making it easier for the lay man to understand.

For example, it removes the term ‘previous year’ and replaces it with ’tax year’.

It also does away with the confusing assessment year terminology.

Currently, income earned for the previous year (2023-2024) is paid in the assessment year (2024-2025).

The bill introduces the ‘tax year’ concept – which it defines as the 12-month period beginning April 1.

The new bill has removed redundant sections like those relating to Fringe Benefit Tax.

The word ’notwithstanding’, which was used excessively in the Income Tax Act, 1961, has been done away with.

It has been replaced almost everywhere with the term ‘irrespective’.

The bill also gives the reader tables and formulae to use when it comes to TDS, presumptive taxation, salaries, and deductions for bad debt.

The proposed law has made the taxes on employees’ stock options (ESOPs) clearer.

The Bill includes important judgments of the past 60 years to give taxpayers more clarity.

It also introduces a ‘Taxpayer’s Charter’ which outlines the rights and obligations of the taxpayers.

What do experts say?

Experts have praised the bill.

Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, M&A Tax Partner at Nangia Andersen LLP told The Times of India, “Carved out now in 23 chapters divided into 536 sections and 16 schedules, over 600 pages, a quick look at the new bills demonstrates its comprehensiveness compared to existing Income Tax Act with 298 sections and 14 schedules.”

“The concepts of explanations and provisos have been removed from the new version, for ease of interpretation and understanding. New concepts such as tax year, instead of previous year and assessment year, have been introduced,” he added.

Jhunjhunwala further told Indian Express that income not forming part of total income has now been shifted to schedules.

“Deductions from salaries such as standard deduction, gratuity, leave encashment etc, have now been tabulated at one place, instead of being scattered over different sections and rules,” Jhunjhunwala added.

“This increase in sections reflects a more structured approach to tax administration, incorporating modern compliance mechanisms, digital governance, and streamlined provisions for businesses and individuals,” AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan told PTI.

Sandeep Agrawal, Director and Founder of Teamlease Regtech told Financial Express, “The New Income Tax Bill, is set to reduce 50 per cent of the current provisions, marking a significant step towards simplifying tax laws and replacing the six-decade-old Income Tax Act of 1961.”

“The bill is expected to make compliance easy for taxpayers and administrators alike, ultimately helping to cut down on tax-related litigation,” Agrawal added.

What happens next?

Once introduced in the Lok Sabha likely on Thursday, the Bill will be sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance for further deliberations.

The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the new I-T Bill said that the Income-tax Act passed in 1961 has been subjected to numerous amendments since its passage 60 years ago.

“As a result of these amendments the basic structure of the Income-tax Act has been overburdened and language has become complex, increasing cost of compliance for taxpayers and hampering efficiency of direct-tax administration,” it said.

Tax administrators, practitioners and taxpayers had also raised concerns about the complicated provisions and structure of the Income-tax Act.

Therefore, the government in the budget in July 2024 announced that a time-bound comprehensive review of the Income-tax Act, 1961 would be undertaken to make the Act concise, lucid, easy to read and understand.

Accordingly, the Income-tax Bill, 2025 has been prepared, which proposes to repeal and replace the Income-tax Act, 1961.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced in Budget 2025-26 that the new tax bill will be introduced during the ongoing session of Parliament.

Sitharaman had first announced a comprehensive review of the Income-tax Act, 1961 in July 2024 Budget.

The CBDT had set up an internal committee to oversee the review and make the Act concise, clear, and easy to understand, which will reduce disputes, litigations, and provide greater tax certainty to taxpayers. Also, 22 specialised sub-committees have been established to review the various aspects of the Income Tax Act.

The Union government is expected to table the new Income Tax Bill in the parliament on Thursday.

In the Budget 2025-26, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that she will introduce new Income Tax Bill that will simplify tax-related affairs. It has since been reported that that the Income Tax Bill is the much-awaited direct tax code that has been in the discussion for years.

In her Budget speech, Sitharaman said that Income Tax bill has been made under the “trust first, scrutinise later” framework. She further said that the Income Tax Bill will feature simplified language that will reduce litigation.

“The new bill will be clear and direct in text with close to half of the present law, in terms of both chapters and words. It will be simple to understand for taxpayers and tax administration, leading to tax certainty and reduced litigation,” said Sitharaman.

What’s there in new Income Tax bill?

The Income Tax Bill 2025 runs into more than 620 pages and has 536 sections, 16 schedules, and 23 chapters.

The CNBC TV-18 has reported sources as saying that the new Income Tax Bill will be tabled in the parliament on Thursday.

Once passed by the parliament, it will come into effect on April 1, 2026, according to the report.

The bill, once it comes into effect, will replace the Income Tax Act of 1961.

CNBC-TV 18 reported sources as alluding that the new Income Tax Bill aims to bring in ease of compliance as new simplified rules will help reduce compliance processes by streamlining paperwork, integrating digital platforms, and simplifying return filing mechanisms.

The bill proposes to replace the ‘assessment year’ with simpler ’tax year’, according to the report.

The tax year will refer to the 12-month period of the financial year starting April 1, as per the report, which added that the term ‘previous year’ will be replaced by ‘financial year’.

Last week, the bill had been approved by the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, paving its way to be tabled in the parliament.

While India seeks to counter global headwinds and uncertainties that can mar its economic growth, it should ensure the boost in demands must not result in high inflation or the burden be placed on indirect taxes, as high income divide is an undeniable reality of the Indian economy read more

If we can achieve GDP growth of 6.7 per cent for FY26 keeping inflation at 4.2 per cent as stated as per RBI’s monetary policy statement, while ensuring ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’, it will be a great achievement. Source: Reuters.

The Reserve Bank of India on Friday cut the repo rate by 0.25 per cent to 6.25 per cent. The move comes after a gap of five years, with the central bank citing easing inflation and slow growth as the reasons behind the cut. At the beginning of the month, the Union Budget 2025 gave the middle class a major tax break, with rationalisation of tax slabs and ensuring the salaried individual earning up to 12.75 lakhs a year paid zero income tax.

The rate cut aims to boost liquidity, as the liquidity deficit in the banking system reached multi-year highs in January—after which the central bank took a slew of measures. On the consumption part, home, car, and MSME loans are set to get cheaper. Before this, the Union Budget was hailed as a ‘good job’ offering the economy a boost in demand, a promise of reforms, and accelerating India on the track of higher growth.

Apparently, ‘tremendous’ global uncertainties, perhaps aggravated by Trump 2.0, require India to have a solid domestic demand base. Another thing can be, as recent data shows— individual taxpayers now contribute more than all companies combined—this could be the reason behind the personal income tax cuts. Also, the notable absence of the mention of corporate tax in Finance Minister Niramla Sitharaman’s budget speech raised questions. Sitharaman indeed talked about the new income tax bill to be tabled on Monday, but then that will not bring any additional tax burden but just simplify tax laws.

Beyond this, the need for the government to boost the public expenditure in an economy, like India, that requires massive infrastructure development, capital creation, social security and welfare measures to support the deprived population is forever more. Also, we need to align them to the grand vision of ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’. For them, the government either needs to borrow or to tax. To this, the central government has stayed on the path of fiscal consolidation with fiscal deficit-to-GDP budgeted at 4.4 per cent for the fiscal year 2026, in line with the previous budget announcements.

The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management act envisions a 3 per cent fiscal deficit however, in the post pandemic fiscal strategy, the glide path is envisioned at 4.5 per cent by fiscal year 2026.

In such a case, the government has the route of indirect taxation—a tax that is levied on goods and services before they reach the customer—to fund its expenses and expenditures. The prime among them is, of course, the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

However, the issue with the indirect taxes is they are not proportional to the income of the individual, and as such heftier on those who earn less.

Also, despite citing the easing inflation, the retail inflation is still well above the RBI’s medium-term target of 4 per cent, though it eased to a four-month low of 5.22 per cent in December and is seen gradually declining towards the target in coming months.

One hopes that ‘boost in consumption’ does not result in rising inflation that is yet closer to the higher margins of the RBI’s target of 2 percentage points away from 4 per cent and disproportionately affects those who earn less, as costs of goods are the same for all.

Also, the depreciation of rupee remains a cause of worry, as this increases the cost of imports, leading to ‘imported inflation’. The rupee depreciated 14 paise to hit a record low of 87.57 against the US dollar in early trade on Thursday.

Income inequality is a crucial aspect to look upon in this context: As per recent reports for rural areas, the Gini coefficient stood at 0.405 in 2023, up from 0.341 in 1955, whereas for urban areas, there was a slight decline to 0.382 from 0.392 during the same time period. With news reports stating how 2023 income inequality exceeded 1950s levels in India.

So, while India seeks to counter global headwinds and uncertainties that can mar its economic growth, it should ensure the boost in demands must not result in high inflation or the burden be placed on indirect taxes, as high income divide is an undeniable reality of the Indian economy.

As such, if we can achieve GDP growth of 6.7 per cent for FY26 keeping inflation at 4.2 per cent as stated as per RBI’s monetary policy statement, while ensuring ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’, it will be a great achievement.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Friday approved the Income Tax Bill, sources told CNN-News 18.

Following the approval, the bill is expected to be tabled in the parliament in the coming week, possibly as early as Monday.

The CNN-News 18 reported that the bill could be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance for broader consultation.

In her Budget speech, Sitharaman said that she would introduce a new income tax will as a reaffirmation of the “commitment of the tax department to ’trust first, scrutinise later’". The Narendra Modi government has pitched the exercise as part of an outreach to the middle class that comprises tax breaks and simplification of tax-collection and filing.

The bill will replace the Income Tax Act of 1961. It intends to simplify the language to make tax compliance easier for taxpayers and make it easier to read and understand the provisions.

While the specifics of the bill are not known, Union Finance Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey told Moneycontrol earlier this week that it will not include any new taxes but bring structural reforms. He added that, once passed, the bill will come into effect on April 1.

“It will not change in that because that will be the prerogative of the tax policy. But structurally, it undergoes a massive change. The way it reads, the way it connects, the way it is understood. And the way the redundancy is removed. So, rationalisation and simplification exercises will follow in that. But some of the key things, reforms have also been brought in here,” said Pandey.

It’s been a month since the Pahalgam attack. India subsequently responded with precise targeting of terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. It also responded effectively to Pakistan’s military escalation, inflicting significant damage on its military assets before both sides agreed to de-escalate. India’s response has clearly set a higher threshold for action against Pakistan-backed terrorism. This has sparked a debate on whether India’s response — both kinetic and non-kinetic — will deter Pakistan, and for how long.

Security analysts have offered several explanations for the motive behind the Pahalgam attack. Apart from aiming to disrupt the return to normalcy

Robbers break into mithai shop, dance like no one’s watching

If celebrating a heist was a thing, two miscreants in Jharkhand have got it right.

Two men in Ranchi broke into Bhola Misthan Bhandar and Restaurant on May 17 and did what isn't usually expected from seasoned thieves. They danced like no one's watching.

The now-viral CCTV footage shows how the duo probably planned the dance moves more than the burglary. The sweet-toothed outlaws not only gobbled down gulab jamuns, but also enjoyed cold drinks before pursuing their assignment.



“They were vibing like it was their birthday party,” said a bewildered Pankaj Gupta, one of the shop owners. “They danced, they ate, they looted. Honestly, I was offended — not by the theft, but by how carefree they were about our kaju barfi.”

Eyewitness? None. Footage? Full Bollywood.

“They even packed sweets — like proper takeaway service — before casually strolling out with Rs 80,000 in cash,” added Ashok Gupta, still emotionally recovering from watching the laddoos disappear.

While police have launched a manhunt, a cop believes these dessert-hunting desperadoes might not be locals. “They’re not from around here. No local thief would dance in our kitchen,” he was quoted as saying by India Today.

An FIR has been filed.

The footage is being analysed. But somewhere in Ranchi, two men are probably still humming "Aaj ki party meri taraf se", and dreaming of their next sweet gig.

String theory

This story is a lesson in avoiding the glorious mix of history and acoustics.

At a recent exhibition in Mumbai, dedicated to the life and rare belongings of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, a Union minister ran into an old violin. Not just any violin. It was the one Ambedkar apparently once practised on.

Naturally, our man, gripped by the moment or maybe the acoustics, decided to pay tribute. Not with a speech, not with silence, but with music.

He picked up the sacred violin and played it. Or tried to.

The minister however, was not up for critcism. He put the comments section off on social media, as a result of which The Telegraph Online could not get a public reaction.

To be fair, our man meant well.

While dragging the bow across the strings like someone brushing a cat backwards, he paid homage to Babasaheb’s musical side. The attendees could have been descendants of Ambedkar, some Buddhist leaders, artists and several VIPs who nodded politely, possibly in emotional uncertainty.

The Union minister's chums won't agree, but the strings would've filed a formal complaint if they could move without human intervention.

But in other historical news, Babasaheb learnt the violin. He was known to be a violin enthusiast and even hired a violin teacher named Balwant Sathe. Despite having health issues and a busy schedule, he dedicated time for the violin.

So the Union minister, according to us, tried to feel that moment. But the moment felt him back…hard.

The violin, last seen quietly returning to its display case, refused to comment.

Bengaluru MLA drives JCB through flooded streets

The JCB has once again lived up to its Internet fame after a local BJP MLA drove one through the waterlogged streets of Sai Layout in Bengaluru, turning the earthmoving machine into a multipurpose vehicle.

The recent 140mm rainfall, which occurred from late Sunday night until Tuesday, resulted in widespread flooding throughout the city.

Among the worst-hit was Sai Layout, a low-lying residential area already infamous for its drainage problems.

The persisting sewage issue of the ‘Silicon Valley of India’ has once again come under the spotlight and has triggered political debates and a war-like situation in the comment sections of several social media posts.

One user commented, “Now tell the rescue team to speak the local language before taking help,” taking a dig at the Kannada row that keeps on making headlines every now and then.

Another quipped, “Rain knows Kannada well, it has been well versed with all its corners.”

Taking aim at the government, a (clearly frustrated) citizen fumed, “This is the consequence of prioritising freebies over development.”

Mysore Pak renamed to Mysore Shree

In Jaipur, where mithai is a love language and every lane has a halwai more popular than a local politician, something naya is cooking.

Tensions between India and Pakistan have bubbled up again after the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives. India responded with Operation Sindoor.

Missiles flew, borders got heated up and in Jaipur sweet shops ended up renaming Mysore Pak.

“We have removed the word 'Pak' from our sweets' names. We have renamed 'Moti Pak' as 'Moti Shree', 'Gond Pak' as 'Gond Shree', 'Mysore Pak' as 'Mysore Shree',” a shopkeeper told NDTV, sounding like he had just announced budget reforms.

While the 'Pak' in Mysore Pak comes from Kannada and simply means sweet (or more technically, a thick sugary syrup used in the making), shopkeepers across the Pink City are in no mood for linguistic nuance. For them, ‘Pak’ is out, and ‘Shree’ is in.

At the centre of this patriotic patisserie push is Tyohaar Sweets, a high-end mithai shop known for its shiny counters and even shinier sweets. Its owner, Anjali Jain, explained the reason behind the rebranding with full deshbhakt energy: “The spirit of patriotism shouldn’t just reside at the border but should live within each citizen. That’s why we decided to remove ‘Pak’ from the names of our sweets and replace it with more culturally resonant and patriotic alternatives.”

Gone are Moti Pak, Aam Pak, Gond Pak and Mysore Pak.

Say hello to Moti Shree, Aam Shree, Gond Shree, and Mysore Shree.

Even their blingy creations like Swarn Bhasm Pak and Chandi Bhasm Pak have been rechristened as Swarn Shree and Chandi Shree.

“Customers themselves urged us to make this change,” Jain said, suggesting that people were looking at sweets, whispering 'yeh bhi Pak hai?' and feeling uneasy mid-bite.

The move is catching on. Other halwais across Jaipur are joining the naamkaran drive. It's like a sanskaar-heavy soap opera — khaane mein wahi swad, naam naya hai.

To be fair, the word ‘Pak’ is as Indian as it gets — coming from Sanskrit, meaning “to cook.” But right now, no one’s in the mood for etymology. It’s more about emotion. As Jain puts it, “When we say ‘Shree’ or ‘Bharat’, it feels like home.”

Sure, some might call it sweet nationalism. Others might say bhai, kuch zyada ho gaya. Either way, Jaipur’s mithai scene is giving deshbhakti a sugary twist.

Asked about a word he wishes more people used, Tharoor cited 'defenestration'.

“To defenestrate means literally, to throw out of the window. ‘Fenestra’ comes from the Latin for ‘a window’. To defenestrate is to throw out of the window but you can use it metaphorically to reject something and to discard something or someone. You can say I was defenestrated by my party or somebody was defenestrated from the cricket team.” Tharoor said as the packed auditorium of the South City International School listened with rapt attention.

Swastika also asked Tharoor how he became a published author when he was just 10 years old and how he inculcated his love for reading.

“I suffered from asthma,” Tharoor revealed. “Those days there were no inhalers, there were no ventilators, no nebulizers and all of these things. They just give you these very strong tablets that made your heart go ‘thud thud thud’ so you could sleep. At least forced your lungs open so they could breathe and I would be literally sitting up, unable to go out and play with my friends or play cricket and what could I do. I would read. I read books of my parents I couldn't fully understand but that helped me with my vocabulary and so on and when I ran out of that I would take the fattest books they had and play book cricket with them. When I ran out of that, what could I do? If I couldn't read, I would write.”.

Commenting on how he was as a kid and if he bunked school, the MP from Thiruvananthapuram replied, I was a good student and the teacher’s pet and I never bunked class. We did go to Flury’s and Firpo’s, not during classes, and there was a debate as to where the better cake was."

For decades, Balochistan—the largest yet most neglected province of Pakistan—has remained in the shadows of the world’s attention. Rich in natural resources but ravaged by poverty, the region has been the site of an unrelenting struggle for autonomy and identity.

This documentary, ‘Balochistan: The Long Road to Resistance’, delves deep into the lived experiences of Baloch civilians—voices long silenced by repression.

As Pakistan continues to accuse its neighbours of sponsoring terrorism, we expose how the state itself has unleashed a different kind of terror on its own people.

From enforced disappearances and custodial torture to extrajudicial killings and media censorship, the Baloch people recount the horrors they have endured—many of which go unreported and unnoticed.

Their testimonies, drawn from survivors, families of the missing, and activists, lay bare a chilling pattern of systemic violence aimed at crushing dissent.

Released in the wake of India’s Operation Sindoor—a retaliatory strike following the Pahalgam massacre—this offers a sobering counter-narrative. It reminds viewers that while global headlines focus on cross-border terror, there is a silent war being waged within Pakistan’s own borders.

‘Balochistan: The Long Road to Resistance’ stitches together the fragments of a people’s pain and resistance—ultimately emerging as a story of resilience, hope, and the indomitable will to be heard.

Payal Kapadia scripted history when her directorial feature debut, 'All We Imagine as Light' won the prestigious Grand Prix, the second-highest accolade at the Cannes Film Festival. This was the first Indian film to win the Grand Prix. She the first Indian director to win the award. Then came Golden Globes. She became the first Indian filmmaker to land a nomination for best director at the 82nd Golden Globe Awards. In an exclusive interview with The Telegraph Online, Kapadia throws light on her journey, her new-found fame and her ambitious project.

"I did not expect that our small film will go to such lengths. We have been working on this film for quite some time. When we make films, our first objective is not that they will go to some film festival. We make films for people to come and watch. But our film went to festivals and that's how we got the distribution. It has released in theatres, all over the country. That is our biggest LIGHT," Kapadia said about her film.

Kapadia's historic journey began in her boarding school in Andhra Pradesh where she could watch one extra film a week on one condition.

"We did not have television in school but we would watch one film every Saturday. When our chemistry teacher who was Bengali, started a film club, we students saw it as an opportunity to watch one more film every week. We watched films of Andrei Tarkovsky, Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak. Our teacher also encouraged us to write film reports afterwards. I wrote my first film report on Ray's 'Mahanagar'. When I read it after so many years, I realised it was so bad. But as a young girl, somehow that film just opened up my mind. Some nerve it touched for sure," Kapadia recalled.



At her alma mater, Pune's prestigious Film and Television Institute of India, the films she watched, the filmmakers she studied inspired her in more ways than one. Kapadia shared how experimental filmmaking shaped her storytelling.

"At FTII, we watched films of Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak, Satyajit Ray, John Abraham, films of the 1960s from the East European countries, French New Wave films by François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and Agnès Varda and Czech films by Miloš Forman. Those filmmakers also didn't have the money to make films in studios. They were the first filmmakers to take their cameras and shoot on the streets. Many filmmakers are now doing that. Instead of worrying about funds to make a big set, we can just go with a DSLR camera and shoot documentary-style. That influence was very useful for me to think visually," Kapadia explained.

While Kapadia captured the heart of Mumbai in 'All We Imagine As Light', her own relation with the city comes to light through her characters. "My relationship with Mumbai is quite contradictory. On one hand, I understand that it is a place of opportunities but it is a very difficult city. It is not a city that is very comfortable, unless you have a lot of money. So, that is a disappointment that I have some times. Inequality has mostly become the characteristic of Mumbai. This makes me angry and I've shown that in my film too," she added.

And it is this relation with Mumbai that Kapadia wants to further explore. "I want to make a trilogy on Mumbai," she said.

Bengal's most consequential resident lives and works not in the state capital Calcutta, but around 226 km away in a town called Jiaganj in Murshidabad district. If not touring, he is at home. He does not go anywhere, the world comes to his door...

His songs have been the most heard among all Indian musicians, living or dead, on music streaming app Spotify, for years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. He dethroned Taylor Swift, the world’s most popular singer, from the numero uno position on the same app, even if for just a day... He rubbed actor Salman Khan the wrong way at an awards event and got away with it, following an apology, later retracted.

He moved court seeking protection for his name, voice, signature, photograph, personality traits on finding artificial intelligence platforms imitating him through algorithms. At the everest of his career, he decided to leave Mumbai and work from his hometown and still stayed on the peak. He is ARIJIT SINGH.

In December 2024, Martin Garrix, Dutch DJ and record producer, ranked one among the top 100 DJs for three consecutive years, was at his Jiaganj residence. So was British singer Ed Sheeran who rode through Jiaganj on his scooter in the middle of the night without any security... He prefers his sleepy hometown over more business-like Mumbai. His family’s ties with the town run deep. So we took a tour of Jiaganj, which accidentally became his hometown, to trace his roots...

Drones and fighter jets. Blackouts and sirens. Blasts and mock drills. It has barely been a week since the pause on military hostilities between India and Pakistan following the massacre at Baisaran. It has barely been a week and already most of us have moved on, not counting the fraction directly in the line of fire.

The trolls are trolling, the TV squares wagging their fingers, the government and the Opposition emerging out of their forced huddle, their fissures once more showing… It has barely been a week and the conversation at cha addas and among morning walkers has already turned from Muridke, Sargodha and S-400 to Kohli’s retirement and the first lot of himsagar. Technology might knit us closer than ever, technically, but nothing like a shared understanding to close other gaps. Perhaps one can better appreciate this normal if one can weigh in that which is passing for normal elsewhere. Here’s a look at some of the ongoing wars — cross-border and internal — across the globe, their consequences and the atrocities they have normalised. After all, it has barely been a week since we had a close shave.

GAZA & WEST BANK

Summary Techno Main Salt Lake’s annual techno-management fest, EDGE 2025, concluded on April 6 with an extraordinary showcase of innovation, creativity, and student-led excellence The festivities began with a formal inauguration on April 3, attended by dignitaries, institutional heads, and faculty members

Techno Main Salt Lake’s annual techno-management fest, EDGE 2025, concluded on April 6 with an extraordinary showcase of innovation, creativity, and student-led excellence. Organised by the college’s official science and technology club Team Geekonix, the 19th edition of the fest upheld its reputation as Kolkata’s largest and Eastern India’s second-largest techno-management fest. Themed "NAVI 19°N: Navigating Ages, Vectoring Interdimensions," the event symbolised futuristic vision and interdisciplinary exploration.

The festivities began with a formal inauguration on April 3, attended by dignitaries, institutional heads, and faculty members. Over three power-packed days, the campus turned into a hub of technical brilliance, cultural synergy, and creative expression — drawing record-breaking participation from across the nation.

April 4 opened with the highly anticipated Creator's Conclave, a one-of-a-kind assembly that featured popular digital creators such as Sayak Chakraborty, Sukanta Kundu (Let’s be Confused), Ananya Guha, Saikat Dey, Akash Ghosh Dastidar, Subham Chaudhuri (Bong Short), and Tapojit Mitra (Harrybol). Audiences were enthralled by conversations that delved deep into content creation, internet culture, and storytelling. The day culminated in the much-hyped trailer launch of "Check in Cheque Out" with the presence of its full team, adding cinematic flair and drawing large-scale footfall to the TMSL campus.

April 5 brought with it a fusion of melody, conversation, and laughter. The day began with the grand Music Showcase of "Dispersion," graced by Bollywood veteran Dalip Tahil and the entire production team, creating an evening of cinematic and musical brilliance. This was followed by EDGE Talks, a fireside chat featuring iconic musicians Rupam Islam and Sidhu, thoughtfully moderated by Meghdut Roychowdhury, Chief Innovation Officer of Techno India Group. The engaging conversation brought forward personal insights on music, creativity, and resilience. The night closed with a high-energy comedy set by Nishant Suri during EDGE Nights, leaving the crowd in roaring laughter and sealing the day with infectious joy.

April 6 concluded the fest with the wildly energetic Red Bull "In My Hood" Party Night. With pulsating beats, a lively crowd, and an electrified atmosphere at TMSL, it marked a fittingly explosive end to a remarkable three-day journey.

EDGE 2025 shattered previous records with its groundbreaking prize pool and an overwhelming number of registrations across flagship events and sub-club competitions. Each sub-club—whether focused on robotics, development, innovation, gaming, photography, or entrepreneurship—witnessed enthusiastic participation from across institutions, creating a vibrant competitive and collaborative environment. The overall footfall across the campus reflected the fest's massive reach and influence, establishing EDGE 2025 as one of the most widely attended editions in its history.

EDGE 2025 was not merely a fest; it was a celebration of youth, creativity, and ambition. With unmatched spirit and execution, Team Geekonix curated a legacy that will inspire future editions. The energy, the passion, and the unified voice of a new generation made EDGE 2025 a phenomenal success, echoing its impact far beyond the campus walls.

Also this year, EDGE 2025 introduces its official anthem — "We Are The Revolution", a powerful track that echoes the ethos of the fest. It encapsulates the spirit of youth, the hunger to create, and the determination to transform. Team Geekonix, the force behind EDGE, embodies this revolutionary energy, turning dreams into deliverables and ideas into icons. The anthem has become a rallying cry that binds every volunteer, participant, and visionary to a unified mission — making EDGE 2025 not just an event, but a bigger, bolder movement toward a reimagined future.

The fest is supported by a strong network of sponsors and partners, with Edugraph (Digital Media Partner), Aqua Diamond (Hydration Partner), Kashyah (Gifting Partner), IndieRise (Animation Partner), Ardent (Training Partner), Tea Junction (Tea Partner), Merchandise Treasures (Prize Pool Partner), Jus’ Jumpin’ (Activity Partner), Sportsplex (Fun Zone Partner), Kalakar Fashion (Merchandise Partner), Winni’s (Bakery Partner), The Dopamine Store (Goodies Partner), Popski (Refreshment Partner), Kolkata Bouncer Group (Safety Support Partner), East End Gaming (Gaming Associate Partner), Micro Center (Gaming Accessories Partner), 91.9 Friends FM (Radio Partner), Ananta Machines (Social Initiative Partner), My FroyoLand (Ice Cream Partner), Burger King (Snacks Partner), Techno Billion AI (AI Partner), Nescafe (Beverage Partner), Calcutta Cacophony (Outreach Partner), The Kolkata Buzz (Social Media Partner), Kit Kat (Chocolate Partner), PVR Inox (Screening Partner)

Over four days this month, as India and Pakistan edged dangerously close to their most serious standoff since 1999 Kargil, most Indian newspapers took the high road. They stuck to official statements, triple-checked their facts, and behaved like grown-ups.

Television, however, decided to defenestrate the basics.

Across prime-time slots, some of Indian TV’s biggest names traded facts for foghorns and turned their studios into virtual war rooms complete with sirens, fake reports, and enough chest-thumping to trigger a mild seismic event. These anchors didn’t just blur the line between news and nationalism, they bulldozed it.

The pinnacle of such nation wants drama moments was when TV celeb and retired Indian Army veteran Gaurav Arya called Iran’s foreign minister “son of a pig” and even wrote 'pig' on the screen showing a news item about Abbas Araghchi’s visit to India and Pakistan.

The Indian embassy in Tehran had to issue a clarification: "The Embassy of India in Iran wishes to clarify that the person in this video is a private Indian citizen."

But apart from that, here are five of the most enthusiastic fictioneers from the early May madness, rated not just by the damage done but also by the sheer creative flair with which they ignored reality.

1. Anjana Om Kashyap (Aaj Tak)

ADVERTISEMENT

One of Aaj Tak's most recognisable faces – thanks also to a demonetisation-era video about currency notes with microchips (spoiler alert, that was fake news too) – Anjana Om Kashyap positioned herself as duty-bound to inform the nation, solemnly declaring that India had "successfully surrounded Pakistan from all sides" and launched a "massive attack" on Lahore and Islamabad.

Sirens blared, maps flashed, and none of it was true. When government statements contradicted these reports, Kashyap continued to stand by her coverage instead of issuing clarifications.

The Telegraph Online rating: Imagination Index: 9/10. Damage Control Score: 0/10.

2. Sweta Singh (Aaj Tak)

2 5 Instagram/@swetasinghat

Joining Kashyap in this high-octane fiction hour, Sweta Singh brought her own brand of confident chaos.

She read “breaking news” straight off her phone, reporting a supposed fidayeen (suicide) attack in Kashmir that the army later denied – while fighting Pakistan.

Delivered with grave concern and absolute certainty, her words sparked real panic in already tense border areas.

The nation was informed, just not accurately.

Telegraph Online rating: Verified Vibes: 1/10. WhatsApp Forward Energy: 11/10.

3. Gaurav Sawant (India Today)

3 5 X/@gauravcsawant

India Today’s executive editor took things up a notch by announcing, with full graphics and gravitas, that the Indian Navy had attacked Karachi. He went on to brag about how this was the first such strike since 1971.

It was bold, dramatic, and completely made up.

Sawant frequently paired real historical facts with imaginary present-day developments, garnished with flashy VFX and thunderous background scores, turning his segments into a surreal, Netflix-meets-newsroom spectacle.

When reality caught up, he stayed quiet and carried on.

Telegraph Online rating: Historical Fiction Score: 10/10. Accountability Index: 0%.

4. Arnab Goswami (Republic TV)

4 5 Youtube/@RepublicWorld

If Indian television had a lead actor in this drama, it was Gen, Arnab Goswami. Known for his no-prisoners style, Goswami went ballistic when US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire on May 10. "This is typical Trump overreach...

Though less individually prominent, these anchors collectively put on a show.

As political tensions continue to simmer over the conduct of Operation Sindoor, the Indian Air Force (IAF) has released a striking new video to celebrate the bravery, valour and heroism of India's armed forces.

The release of the video comes shortly after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reignited his criticism of external affairs minister S. Jaishankar over the reported loss of Indian aircraft during Operation Sindoor.

Gandhi accused the government of informing Pakistan at the outset of the operation — a move he called “a crime.”

“How many Indian aircraft did we lose because Pakistan knew?” Gandhi asked pointedly on May 19, referencing Jaishankar’s earlier remarks that India had informed Pakistan at the beginning of the operation.

Rahul vs Jaishankar

Earlier on X, Gandhi reshared a post and wrote, “EAM Jaishankar’s silence isn’t just telling — it’s damning. So I’ll ask again: How many Indian aircraft did we lose because Pakistan knew? This wasn’t a lapse. It was a crime. And the nation deserves the truth.”

This was Gandhi’s second public statement on the matter, following his May 17 post that stated, “Informing Pakistan at the start of our attack was a crime. EAM has publicly admitted that GOI did it. Who authorised it? How many aircraft did our air force lose as a result?”

In response, the Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement pushing back strongly against the allegations: “External Affairs Minister had stated that we had warned Pakistan at the start, which is clearly the early phase after Op Sindoor’s commencement. This is being falsely represented as being before the commencement. This utter misrepresentation of facts is being called out.”

Veteran broadcaster and former England striker Gary Lineker has confirmed he will leave the BBC after presenting his final episode of Match of the Day on May 25, ending a three-decade-long association with the public broadcaster.

The decision follows a week of intense controversy after Lineker reshared content on his Instagram account that was widely condemned for containing antisemitic imagery.

The post, which was intended to serve as an explainer on the harms of Zionist nationalist ideology, featured a caricature of Jewish people as rats—an image with deep-rooted antisemitic connotations, most notoriously used in Nazi Germany to depict Jews as vermin.

Lineker deleted the post soon after and issued a public apology, stating, “On Instagram I reposted material which I have since learned contained offensive references. I very much regret these references. I would never knowingly share anything antisemitic. It goes against everything I believe in.”

In a separate statement released on May 19, Lineker said, “I did not see the image, and would never consciously repost anything antisemitic. However, I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.”

The BBC has confirmed that his departure does not include a financial settlement.

He had been scheduled to present the 2026 FIFA World Cup and next season’s FA Cup for the corporation.

Lineker, the BBC’s highest-paid on-air star, will sign off after this weekend’s coverage of the final gameweek of the 2024–25 Premier League season.

The decision to allow Lineker to present the final episode of Match of the Day has drawn criticism from some media professionals, who accused the BBC of letting him depart on his own terms despite what they described as a serious lapse in judgment.

BBC Director General Tim Davie said in a statement, “Gary has acknowledged the mistake he made. Accordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season. Gary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades. His passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and earned him the respect of sports fans across the UK and beyond. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made.”

Lineker took over Match of the Day from Des Lynam in 1999 and quickly became a familiar and authoritative voice in British football coverage.

Reflecting on his departure, he said, “Football has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember – both on the pitch and in the studio. I care deeply about the game and about the work I've done with the BBC over many years.”

He also addressed the specific nature of the post in question, saying, “I would never, ever have shared the post if I had seen the emoji, which has awful connotations.”

Lineker has long been outspoken on various humanitarian and social issues, frequently clashing with BBC leadership over the broadcaster’s rules on impartiality.

In recent years, new regulations required flagship presenters to refrain from commenting on social or political matters in order to “respect the BBC’s impartiality.”

In his farewell Instagram video, Lineker reiterated his commitment to using his platform for social causes, stating, “Whilst I strongly believe in the importance of speaking out on humanitarian issues, including the tragedy unfolding in Gaza, I also know that how we do so matters.”

He added that standing up for minorities and oppressed groups remains a key personal value.

Lineker will be succeeded on Match of the Day by Gabby Logan, Kelly Cates and Mark Chapman.

Meanwhile, social media users came out in support of the former footballer, with many accusing the BBC of “not speaking” out against genocide and defending Lineker’s record of raising awareness for humanitarian issues.

So many competitive exams in the country but job seekers chose to fall for Vishal Mega Mart.

The retail chain conducted a complex exam for hiring security guards, where candidates had to answer questions on current affairs, English and the local language. A medical test and physical aptitude test were also part of the selection criteria. According to reports, candidates with prior experience in security, shooting training or martial arts were prioritised.

Several job-seekers ended up appearing for an exam which aimed to shortlist a candidate for one vacancy.

Not sure whether the right candidate made it to the uniform, but memers and social media pundits did have a field day.

Vishal Mega Mart's security guard positions offer salaries ranging from Rs 9,000 to Rs 25,000 per month, depending on experience, with freshers earning Rs 9,000-12,000, experienced guards Rs 13,000-18,000, and supervisory roles Rs 19,000-25,000, according to data from Ambition Box and Glassdoor.

YouTuber Dhruv Rathee has come under fire over a controversial video that allegedly hurt Sikh religious sentiments.

On Monday, he took down the AI-generated video titled "The Sikh Warrior Who Terrified the Mughals" following objections from prominent Sikh institutions including the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), and the Akal Takht.

Many viewers found Rathee’s use of animation to represent Sikh gurus in human form offensive. “I condemn the AI-based video made by Dhruv Rathee. This video should be removed immediately. The SGPC should also contact the ministry concerned and have it taken down,” said Kuldeep Singh Gargaj, acting jathedar of the Akal Takht.

Following the backlash, Rathee took to Instagram to share his stance on the issue. “Thank you for your feedback on the latest video.

Mukul Dev was dropped from the 2000 romantic drama Kya Kehna after he failed to reach the sets on time on the first day of the shoot. Producer Ramesh Taurani got so angry with him that he replaced him with Saif Ali Khan, and asked Mukul to return the signing amount of Rs 50,000.

Mukul Dev impressed the filmmakers and the audiences with his charming, striking looks in his debut film Dastak in 1996. However, the actor faced multiple struggles in his career and didn't land a breakthrough role that would make him a star. One film could have changed the trajectory of his career, but he was thrown out from the movie after he failed to reach the sets on time on the first day of the shoot. Mukul was cast opposite Preity Zinta in the 2000 romantic drama Kya Kehna, but was replaced by Saif Ali Khan at the last moment. The producer Ramesh Taurani even asked him to return the signing amount of Rs 50,000. Mukul Dev passed away on May 23 at the age of 54 after a brief illness.

Sharing details about Mukul's exit from Kya Kehna, Ramesh Taurani told News18 Showsha, "Actually, Saif wasn’t supposed to do Kya Kehna. An actor called Mukul Dev was going to do it, but he didn’t show up on set on the first day of the shoot. At around 11 am, someone from the production called him up to ask where he was, and he said that he was on his way. They called again at noon, and he said that he’s outside RK Studio, but he never showed up."

The producer further added, "Our sets were ready, we had to start shooting. I decided to call Saif. I asked if he would be free to meet in the evening, and he said that he would. That’s when I was told that Mukul Dev had come by to the office. I said that I don’t have any interest in speaking to him, and that he should go back home. But he waited outside. When we were leaving to meet Saif, I spoke to him."

After waiting for hours outside Ramesh Taurani's office, Mukul Dev was finally let in and was told that he was no longer a part of Kya Kehna, and would have to return the signing amount of Rs 50,000 as he had broken their trust. Also starring Chandrachur Singh, Anupam Kher, and Farida Jalal in the leading roles, the Kundan Shah directorial became a massive hit at the box office.

Asserting that Tollywood, as the industry is called, is not demonstrating gratitude, the actor-politician noted that the film industry's representatives are yet to meet Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, even a year after the formation of the NDA alliance government.

Andhra Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Pawan Kalyan on Saturday accused the Telugu film industry players of "lacking minimum respect" towards the TDP-led NDA government at a time when it is contemplating to accord industry status and develop it further. Asserting that Tollywood, as the industry is called, is not demonstrating gratitude, the actor-politician noted that the film industry's representatives are yet to meet Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, even a year after the formation of the NDA alliance government.

"At a time when the government is thinking of giving industry status and developing the film industry, including ensuring that their (filmmakers) respect is not lowered, they do not have even minimum respect or gratitude towards Andhra Pradesh government," said Kalyan in a press release. The Janasena chief, who is also a popular actor, observed that the filmmakers would only come during the release of their movies but refrain from activities such as developing the field. He said that this negligence was noticed even after he suggested all the filmmakers unite.

According to Kalyan, various wings of the film industry forgot the alleged humiliation meted out to them during the erstwhile YSRCP government. Instead of individually coming during the release of movies for hiking ticket prices and resolving other grievances, Kalyan advised the filmmakers to come together to clearly discuss their problems, and added the government has been responding to them favourably.

Many women have described this experience as feeling like being stabbed in different parts of the body.

Period cramps, medically known as Dysmenorrhea, are a common problem faced by many women that can significantly affect quality of life. From vomiting, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, headaches and sharp pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis, it can feel like your body is going through a war.

Many women have described this experience as feeling like being stabbed in different parts of the body. The body undergoes so many changes at once that it not only disrupts day-to-day life, but also your mood and hormones go for a toss. However, through natural and medicated methods, menstrual cramps can be managed.

Recently, nutritionist Deepsikha Jain shared a video on her Instagram addressing this issue. She shared how eating dark chocolate can help reduce period cramps.

''Dark chocolate is an excellent source of magnesium, which helps reduce muscle contractions and ease period cramps. Magnesium also boosts serotonin levels, making you feel happier. In addition, dark chocolate is rich in antioxidants, which help reduce inflammation and relieve period discomfort,'' Jain said in the video.

Other remedies:

Doctors claim that taking a calcium supplement, using a heating pad on your pelvic area, gently massaging your abdomen, taking a warm bath, doing mild yoga, exercising, and eating healthy also help with severe cramps.

Other benefits of eating dark chocolate:

Dark chocolate contains flavonoids and polyphenols, powerful antioxidants that help improve brain function by releasing endorphins and serotonin, also known as 'feel good chemicals', which also help relieve oxidative stress and improve mood. Moderate consumption of dark chocolate may improve blood flow, lower blood pressure, and reduce the risk of heart disease.

Also read: Covid-19, Nipah virus, what makes Kerala first state to report cases of virus in India

Whenever a new virus spreads in India, be it Coronavirus, Nipah virus or others, the first state in India to report the number of such cases is Kerala. This is the first state which shows the red flag of any new virus. The reason behind is its robust and most efficient health infrastructure.

As Covid-19 cases have been rising once again the world over, especially in India, Singpore, Hong Kong and other Asian countries, one question that comes to mind is that whenever a new virus spreads in India, be it Coronavirus, Nipah virus or others, the first state in India to report the number of such cases is Kerala. This is the first state which shows the red flag of any new virus. In the first occurrence of Covid-19, the first case in India was reported from Kerala when a 20-year-old student returned from Wuhan to Thrissur on January 30, 2020, with the first infection. Even in 2025 when new cases have been reported in India, Kerala is one among two other states that have reported the most cases.

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) convened a review meeting on Monday with experts from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Emergency Medical Relief (EMR) division, Disaster Management Cell, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and central government hospitals. The expert review meeting concluded that the current COVID-19 situation in India remains under control.

What makes Kerala report cases of virus first?

However, the reason that we see cases being first reported from Kerala does not show its weakness but a sign of a robust and most efficient health infrastructure. Its disease surveillance system is highly active and advanced than that of even the central government. The health system is linked to the lower levels as every district has its own team including virologists and infection control officers who monitor the coronavirus trend daily.

After Thrissur reported its first case of Covid-19, the central government and other states started making the same arrangements as that of the state disease control model. For example, door-to-door screening, training of local health volunteers, real-time digital health records, and decentralised tracking systems.

The latest wave of Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 has hit many countries in Southeast Asia, with the spread of new Omicron sub variants like jN.1. India, too has reported 164 fresh cases of Covid 19, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Rajasthan.

Joe Biden, the previous American president who left office this January, was diagnosed with prostate cancer at the weekend. The diagnosis came nearly an year after Biden had to drop out of the 2024 US presidential race amid rising concerns over his health.

Joe Biden, the previous American president who left office this January, was diagnosed with prostate cancer at the weekend. The diagnosis came around an year after Biden had to drop out of the 2024 US presidential race amid rising concerns over his health. His office said in a statement on Sunday the cancer had spread to his bones and had been classified as "high-grade." The news has raised a flurry of questions around prostate cancer, what causes it, and how the disease can be prevented. Let us brief you about them here.

What is prostate cancer and how common is it?

Prostate cancer occurs when cells in the prostate gland grow out of control. The prostate is a small gland part of the male reproductive system. It is located below the bladder and in front of the rectum.

Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer among men, after skin cancer, according to the American medical center Cleveland Clinic. Thirteen out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some point in their lives, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says.

What are its symptoms?

Prostate cancer may not present symptoms initially. When they begin to appear, symptoms may include the following:

Blood in the urine.

Blood in semen.

Urge to urinate more often than usual

Having difficulty in urinating.

If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, symptoms can include accidental urine leakage, back pain, bone pain, feeling exhaustion, loss of weight, and weakness in limbs.

What causes prostate cancer?

It's not clear what exactly causes prostate cancer, but there are certain factors that raise the risk of the disease. These include old age, obesity, tobacco smoking, and having someone in the family with the disease.

Survival rate

A person's survival chances after being diagnosed with prostate cancer vary on a range of factors. However, most with early-stage prostate cancer live for several years. Even when detected at an advanced stage, patients can expect to live for years with proper treatment.

Every year, May 17 is observed as World Hypertension Day. Doctors say that with nearly 30 percent of India’s adult population living with high blood pressure, hypertension has become one of the leading risk factors for heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and premature death.

Every year, May 17 is observed as World Hypertension Day. Doctors say that with nearly 30 percent of India’s adult population living with high blood pressure, hypertension has become one of the leading risk factors for heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and premature death. They are urging people to rethink what is considered ‘normal’ this World Hypertension Day. Despite its significant impact on public health, a large number of people with hypertension remain undiagnosed, underscoring the urgent need for a national shift in healthcare priorities, according to a study titled Health of the Nation 2025, conducted by Apollo Hospitals in February.

The study also estimated that approximately 300 million people in India have hypertension. The prevalence is notably high among younger populations, with 26 per cent of those under 45 diagnosed with high blood pressure in 2024. What’s more concerning, doctors say, is that nearly half of those with high blood pressure are unaware of their condition.

“Prevention and early intervention are not just options—they are imperatives. Alarmingly, nearly 30 per cent of India’s urban population under the age of 40 is already affected by hypertension or prehypertension. This calls for immediate and collective action across healthcare, policy, and community awareness to protect the health of our fellow citizens,” said Dr Preetha Reddy, Executive Vice Chairperson of Apollo Hospitals.

She noted that 80 percent of heart attacks and strokes caused by hypertension could be prevented through simple lifestyle changes, such as reducing salt intake, increasing physical activity, and managing stress.

Dr Prathap C Reddy, Founder and Chairman of Apollo Hospitals, emphasised that prevention is the first prescription and advocated making routine screenings a national priority. He urged Indians to begin screenings early, particularly after the age of 30 or if they have a family history of heart disease.

“Incorporating advanced imaging techniques like Coronary Calcium Scoring can help reveal hidden risks, while adopting preventive treatment strategies for those showing early markers—even if asymptomatic—can significantly reduce future complications,” he added.

Coronary Calcium Scoring is a non-invasive scan that detects calcium buildup in the coronary arteries. These deposits are early signs of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and can raise the risk of heart attacks.



Preetha Reddy said, "With rapid urbanisation, we are witnessing a sharp rise in sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary habits, and unrelenting stress—all of which are fueling this public health crisis."

These growths can be benign (non-cancerous), which are generally harmless and do not spread, or malignant (cancerous), which can spread to other parts of the body.

Television actor Dipika Kakar, best known for her role in Sasural Simar Ka, has been diagnosed with a liver tumour. On Thursday, her husband Shoaib Ibrahim shared this news in his vlog titled "Need Your Prayers."

He shared with concerned fans that the tumour is tennis ball-sized and is located on the left side of her liver.

“When I was in Chandigarh, Dipika started having pain in her stomach and initially we thought it was due to acidity. But when the pain did not decrease, she consulted our family doctor, who also treated our father. He gave some antibiotics and asked her to get blood tests done. Then she was on antibiotics till May 5, and when I returned, she was doing fine,” Shoaib said.

He also informed that it's far more serious than they expected and she will be hospitalised for surgery soon.

He further added, “Then, after papa’s birthday, she once again started experiencing pain and meanwhile the blood test reports came, which indicated that she had an infection in her body. Our doctor asked us to visit again, and when we met him, he asked us to do a CT scan, and it showed that Dipika has a tumour in the left lobe of her liver. It is big in size, like a tennis ball. It was very shocking for us.”

Yogurt is a superfood that provides every nutrient your body needs. It is high in calcium, B vitamins, and trace minerals.

Every day, we come across a new video doing the rounds on social media about health, wellness, and lifestyle, but very few of them come with reliable and credible information -- like the recent one about the benefits of mixing fruits with yogurt.

Since our childhood, it has been ingrained in our minds that mixing different food items can cause health-related problems, which is not true.

Recently, popular health nutritionist Deepshika Jain debunked this myth about mixing fruits with yogurt and highlighted its health benefits.

She shared three main benefits of eating fruits with yogurt:

Improves gut health

Helps with weight loss and stabilises blood sugar levels

A good source of vitamins and antioxidants, which help improve heart health, skin, and reduce stress

''This is what happens when you start mixing fruits with yogurt. First, this combination will help improve your gut health because fruits are rich in prebiotic and yogurt is rich in probiotic, two of which can actually increase the count of good gut bacteria. Second, this combination will actually help you lose weight and stabilize your blood sugar because fruits are rich in fiber, yogurt is rich in protein, which will keep you fuller for longer and also not spike your blood sugar. And last, fruits with yogurt will give you so much vitamins and antioxidants and these things will reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, improve your heart health, and also give you a better skin. So now, start eating your fruits with the yogurt,'' Jain said.

Benefits of fruits

Fruits are packed with numerous vitamins, minerals, and fibre. They offer countless benefits:

Manage weight and blood sugar levels

Boost the immune system

Aid the digestive system

Improve skin texture

Bebefits of yogurt

Yogurt is a superfood that provides every nutrient your body needs. It is high in calcium, B vitamins, and trace minerals.

Once overlooked, Type 5 Diabetes is now recognised as a distinct condition, mostly seen in underweight, undernourished individuals in low-income regions. Unlike Type 1 or 2, it often responds to tablets instead of insulin and millions may be affected.

A lesser-known form of diabetes, first identified over 75 years ago, is now making a significant comeback in global medical discussions. Now named Type 5 diabetes, this condition was officially recognised earlier this week by Prof Peter Schwarz, president of the International Diabetes Federation, during the World Congress of Diabetes 2025 held in Bangkok. A global task force has also been formed to study its spread and underlying causes.

According to experts, Type 5 diabetes does not fit the common profiles of either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. 'People living with Type 5 diabetes are typically underweight, have no family history of diabetes and show symptoms that do not quite match Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes,' said Dr Nihal Thomas, professor of the department of endocrinology at Christian Medical College Vellore (CMC), who is also part of the newly formed task force.

The condition was first observed in the 1960s among undernourished populations across India, Pakistan, and parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Originally called J type diabetes, as it was first detected in Jamaica, it was briefly included in the World Health Organisation’s classification in 1985. However, it was removed in 1998 due to lack of solid physiological evidence and was long considered a mismanaged form of existing types of diabetes.

In 2022, renewed attention came through a study conducted by Dr Thomas and Dr Riddhi Dasgupta of CMC, along with Prof Meredith Hawkins of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York. Their research demonstrated that Type 5 diabetes is indeed physiologically different from both Type 1 and Type 2. 'Those with Type 5 are insulin deficient, but not insulin resistant. This is a key difference from Type 2 diabetes, where the body resists insulin’s action despite producing it,' Dr Thomas said.

Patients diagnosed with this condition usually have an extremely low Body Mass Index (BMI), often less than 18.5kg/m2. While past studies have shown that babies born with low birth weight who are later overfed may develop Type 2 diabetes, researchers found that those who remain undernourished after birth may instead develop Type 5 diabetes.

Another major distinction is that patients with Type 5 do not have the antibodies commonly seen in Type 1 diabetes. Moreover, nearly half of the affected individuals can be managed with oral medication alone. 'Also, about 50% of them could be managed with tablets, not insulin. This is important as Type 5 is mostly seen in areas of low resources,' Dr Thomas added. In India, for example, cases are more commonly seen in regions with lower gross domestic product (GDP).

The study findings were published in the journal Diabetes Care in 2022. Following this, Scientific American in 2023 published a detailed review that helped bring more international focus to this long-overlooked condition.

Dr Thomas also clarified that Type 5 should not be confused with MODY-5 (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young or HNF1-beta mutations), a rare genetic form of diabetes. 'There are about 25 to 30 million cases of Type 5 diabetes worldwide, perhaps more,' he added.

Nipah virus spreads from fruit bats to humans. It can also spread between people who are in close contact.

A 42-year-old woman in Valanchery, Malappuram district, Kerala, has tested positive for the Nipah virus. This is the third Nipah case in the area since 2018. The woman is now in critical condition and being treated in a special care unit.

The woman first had a fever on April 25. Her condition got worse, and she was admitted to a hospital on May 1. Later, she showed serious symptoms like cough, trouble breathing and swelling in the brain. Her test results from a top lab confirmed the Nipah infection.

Authorities have created a containment zone around her home. Areas in Valanchery and nearby villages like Marakkara and Athavanad are being watched closely. Her close family members tested negative but will stay under observation for 21 days.

What Is Nipah Virus?

Nipah virus spreads from fruit bats to humans. It can also spread between people who are in close contact. The virus can be very dangerous and often leads to death if not treated quickly.

Common signs and symptoms

Fever

Headache

Muscle pain

Vomiting

Sore throat

Cough

Breathing problems

Feeling sleepy or confused

Seizures

Brain swelling

In severe cases, people can fall into a coma within one or two days.

How is it treated?

There is no specific cure or vaccine for Nipah virus yet. Doctors give care to help with the symptoms and prevent further problems. Early treatment is very important.

How to stay safe

Avoid contact with bats and sick animals

Do not eat fruits that animals may have bitten

Wash your hands often

Wear masks in affected areas

Avoid drinking raw date palm sap

The caffeine culture has been induced majorly by stressful work environments. It may work as a stress buster but in the long run it severely affects health. Fitness icon Milind Soman revealed that due to the working conditions of models, they tend to consume more than 10 cups of coffee and tea.

Drinking coffee and tea especially during work hours is seen very common as consuming caffeine has been normalised as part of our daily routine. This caffeine culture has been induced majorly by stressful work environments. It may work as a stress buster but in the long run it severely affects health. In an old interview, fitness icon Milind Soman revealed that due to the working conditions of models, they tend to consume more than 10 cups of tea and coffee daily.

Milind Soman’s take on caffeine and a healthy lifestyle

The former model said, “Usually, models drink a lot of tea and coffee, maybe even 15 to 20 cups a day. They smoke cigarettes and consume alcohol – because of stress, maybe, people get into these habits.” Talking about his routine, Soman simply rejected the idea of caffeine and said, “I don’t drink tea or coffee.” Since his childhood, Milind Soman has built up a great health routine which has made him a toned man with a muscular body and athletic build, healthier than many so-called fit actors. His commitment to healthy habits gave him the title of ‘Ironman.’

In the old interview on Ek Din Ek Jeevan, hosted by Tavleen Singh, the actor, model, marathoner revealed, “The first thing I have is fruit juice.”

“From a young age, I did not develop a habit of drinking tea or coffee. I recall reading somewhere in my childhood that these are bad for one's health. Usually, models drink a lot of tea and coffee, maybe even 15 to 20 cups a day. They smoke cigarettes and consume alcohol – because of stress, maybe, people get into these habits," he added.

Health effects of high caffeine consumption

Soman’s revelation about high caffeine consumption, especially to relieve stress due to high pressure jobs is a wake-up call for those who tend to consume such adaptogens to give us instant energy or just relieve us from the current problem.

According to experts, high levels of caffeine can affect the body very soon and over time. Health experts say that its effects in the short term feels like jittery, anxious, insomnia, an upset stomach, or even nausea and vomiting. Increase in heart rate and blood pressure also happens. High caffeine consumption disturbs iron absorption, increasing the risk of anaemia and other nutrient deficiencies.

In the long run, risks become more concerning, like constant high rate of heart and blood pressure can lead to cardiovascular strain. Uneven sleep patterns occur which affect mood, immunity, and long-term mental health. Increase dependency on caffeine can lead to withdrawal symptoms like headaches, irritability, and fatigue

Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that form on or within an ovary.

Hailey Bieber, the 28-year-old model and entrepreneur, recently opened up on Instagram about her struggle with ovarian cysts. She revealed that she currently has two ovarian cysts, which is the second time she has experienced this health issue. Two years ago, she shared that she had a cyst the size of an apple on her ovary. Hailey made it clear that she doesn’t suffer from endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which are often associated with ovarian cysts.

What Are Ovarian Cysts?

Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that form on or inside an ovary. They are quite common and can happen as part of the normal menstrual cycle. Most ovarian cysts are harmless and usually go away on their own without the need for treatment. However, some cysts may cause symptoms such as bloating, cramping, and nausea, or they may become large and require medical attention.

Why Do Ovarian Cysts Recur?

There are several reasons why ovarian cysts may recur. Certain types of cysts, like dermoid cysts, can come back after a few years. Dermoid cysts are formed from cells that are present from early development in the body. These cysts are often found in both ovaries and may require removal if they become large or cause discomfort. Another type, known as endometriomas or "chocolate cysts," can return even after the cyst wall has been removed. For young women, especially those in their twenties or thirties, the chances of recurrent cysts may be higher because of regular ovulation each month.

Treatment Options for Ovarian Cysts

In many cases, ovarian cysts don’t need treatment and may go away on their own. However, if a cyst causes significant symptoms or complications, there are several treatment options available:

Hormonal Medications: Birth control pills can help regulate the menstrual cycle and prevent new cysts from forming. This may be recommended if cysts keep coming back.

Surgical Intervention: If a cyst is large, persistent, or suspected to be cancerous, it may need to be removed through surgery. This can be done with a minimally invasive procedure like laparoscopy or through open surgery, depending on the size and nature of the cyst.

Lifestyle Changes to Manage Ovarian Cysts

While medical treatments are important, making certain lifestyle changes can also help manage ovarian cysts and reduce the chances of them coming back:

Healthy Diet: Eating a balanced diet that includes anti-inflammatory foods like berries, leafy greens, and turmeric can be helpful. Reducing the intake of saturated fats, meat, and dairy products may also benefit those with ovarian cysts.

Regular Exercise: Regular physical activity, such as yoga, can help maintain hormonal balance and reduce inflammation, which can be beneficial in managing cysts.

Hydration: Drinking plenty of water helps keep the body healthy and supports hormonal function.

Avoid Harmful Habits: Limiting alcohol consumption and avoiding smoking can help reduce the risk of cysts becoming more problematic.

Stress Management: Managing stress through techniques like meditation or deep breathing exercises can also support overall health.

Health officials in Thailand have confirmed the death of a 53-year-old man from Anthrax, a serious bacterial illness, after consuming raw meat. The DDC linked the death with the consumption and distribution of beef during a religious festival.

Health officials in Thailand have confirmed the death of a 53-year-old man from Anthrax, a serious bacterial illness, after consuming raw meat. The country's Department of Disease Control (DDC) confirmed the first confirmed human death from the Don Tan district in Mukdahan province, The Nation Thailand reported.

What is Anthrax?

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. While Anthrax primarily affects livestock and wild animals, it can spread to humans due to contact with infected animals or animal products, or through inhalation or ingestion of anthrax spores.

The DDC linked the death with the consumption and distribution of beef during a religious festival. The deceased patient, a construction worker with underlying diabetes, developed a lesion on his right hand on April 24 and was hospitalised on April 27.

The man passed away during treatment as his symptoms worsened making his wound black, swelling lymph nodes under the right armpit, fainting, and causing seizures, the report said. The Thai authorities reported no unusual illness or death in animals from the area but issued a public health alert and the officials are actively monitoring to contain the spread of anthrax.

Meanwhile, officials from the country's Department of Livestock Development (DLD) noted that they have collected samples -- including dried meat and hides from pigs and cattle, meat and blood from cutting boards, and cow faeces -- to further monitor the presence of the disease in the country. They have also implemented control measures like quarantining animals and administering penicillin antibiotics for 3-5 days; banning cattle grazing in high-risk zones; decontaminating high-risk areas, including slaughter sites and drainage systems; monitoring soil in animal pens for contamination and conducting animal health surveillance in Don Tan district, the report said.

The health officials have urged farmers to watch for signs such as sudden animal deaths and bleeding from the mouth, nose, or anus; and to report and seek immediate medical help. They have also strongly advised the public against eating raw meat.

Text neck is a modern issue, but with small habit changes, you can prevent pain and keep your neck healthy.

In today’s digital age, our phones have become constant companions. From scrolling social media to answering emails, we rarely put them down. But this seemingly harmless habit comes with a modern health issue known as text neck. It might sound like a buzzword, but it is a very real condition affecting people of all ages.

What Is Text Neck?

Your head weighs around 10 to 12 pounds. When you stand or sit upright with good posture, your neck handles this weight effortlessly. However, every time you tilt your head forward to check your phone or tablet, the pressure on your neck increases dramatically.

At a 15-degree tilt, your neck feels like it is supporting 27 pounds.

At 30 degrees, that weight increases to 40 pounds.

At a steep 60 degrees, it is as if your neck is carrying 60 pounds.

Now imagine doing this for hours a day. That is exactly what leads to text neck, which is strain and stress on the cervical spine caused by prolonged forward head posture.

Symptoms of Text Neck

Text neck does not always start with severe pain. It often begins with subtle signs such as:

Neck pain or stiffness

Discomfort in the shoulders and upper back

Headaches caused by tension in the neck

A visible curve forming in the upper back

Tingling or numbness in the arms and hands in more serious cases

If ignored, these symptoms can affect your posture, mobility, and overall spinal health.

How to Fix and Prevent Text Neck

The good news is that text neck is treatable and largely preventable. Here are a few ways to reverse its effects and avoid long-term problems.

1. Correct Your Posture

Be aware of how you hold your devices. Bring your phone up to eye level instead of bending your head down. Whether sitting or standing, keep your ears aligned with your shoulders and avoid slouching.

2. Take Frequent Breaks

Every 20 to 30 minutes, take a break from screens. Look up, stretch, and gently move your neck in different directions. These small actions give your spine a much-needed reset.

3. Stretch and Strengthen

Incorporate simple exercises to support your neck and upper back.

Chin tucks help strengthen neck muscles

Neck tilts and rotations relieve stiffness

Shoulder blade squeezes improve upper back support

Chest stretches open your posture and reduce rounding

Doing these regularly can improve flexibility and ease tension.

4. Adjust Your Work Setup

If you use a computer, make sure your screen is at eye level. Use stands for tablets or e-readers to keep your screen height comfortable. A properly aligned workspace reduces the urge to hunch forward.

5. Seek Professional Help if Needed

If the pain continues or gets worse, it is wise to consult a doctor, physiotherapist, or chiropractor. They can offer personalised advice and treatment to help you recover.

Digital technology has penetrated deeply in our lifestyles which we have adopted completely in our everyday life. Be it office work, education, entertainment digital space has become part of our living. However, this lifestyle has become an addiction as most of us tend to use digital devices everywhere we go and in everything we do. This not only has a negative effect on our time but also on our health and it leads us to become more dependent on such devices and technology. In recent times, people have started using mobile phones in toilets/washrooms.

Digital technology has penetrated deeply in our lifestyles which we have adopted completely in our everyday life. Be it office work, education, entertainment digital space has become part of our living. However, this lifestyle has become an addiction as most of us tend to use digital devices everywhere we go and in everything we do. This not only has a negative effect on our time but also on our health and it leads us to become more dependent on such devices and technology. In recent times, people have started using mobile phones in toilets/washrooms.

Using phones in toilet leads to various diseases

This habit of taking our phones everywhere, even toilet, leads to serious illness which can damage multiple areas of our body. It has also been noticed that we spend most of the time looking at our phones and scrolling inside toilet. We don't realise how dangerous this can be for our health. Dr Kunal Sood, MD has taken to social media to address this health issue by suggesting some steps to prevent the diseases caused by using phones in toilet and the correct posture while sitting in the toilet.

Dr Kunal Sood stated that spending more time in the toilet than required combined with using mobile phone can lead to serious diseases like hemorrhoids, also called piles, constipation, and kidney-related issues. Sitting on the toilet seat for long puts a sustained pressure on the veins around the anus. This is a crucial time for this regular activity, and if people are distracted by phones at this time, this pressure increases which leads to such diseases.

Moreover, some people sit for so long that the toilet starts to feel like a comfortable place to them. However, this affects the natural bowel movement of the stomach.

Right sitting position in a toilet

On his Instagram post, Dr Kunal listed out five ways to prevent Hemorrhoids.

-Limit Time to 5–10 minutes on the toilet when you can.

-Avoid Straining: Don’t force bowel movements. If you’re constipated, consider dietary changes or stool softeners.

-Use Proper Posture: Keep your knees slightly elevated (e.g., using a footstool) to promote easier bowel movements.

-Fiber and Hydration: Ensure a high-fiber diet and adequate hydration to prevent constipation and ease bowel movements.

-Stay Active: Avoid prolonged sitting in general, as it can increase the risk of hemorrhoids

Mukesh Ambani and Nita Ambani’s son Anant Ambani has always been in the news and mostly talked about his weight. Despite adapting every possible regime or lifestyle to get into the right weight, the younger of the three siblings could not maintain his weight.

Mukesh Ambani and Nita Ambani’s son Anant Ambani has always been in the news and mostly talked about his weight. Despite adapting every possible regime or lifestyle to get into the right weight, the younger of the three siblings could not maintain his weight.

How Anant Ambani reduced his weight?

Back in 2016, Anant Ambani reduced weight at extraordinary levels, he lost 108 kgs in 1.5 years (18 months), garnering praise from worldover and becoming an inspiration for many who were still struggling to lose weight. His lifestyle and diet routines had gone viral.

Anand Ambani’s weight trainer was Vinod Channa, who was a fitness trainer for many big Bollywood stars. Under Channa, Ambani showed perseverance, and strict determination while continuing his rigorous training routine. Vinod Channa used to monitor Anant’s daily calorie intake which he limited to only 1200 calories each day.

Then why he regained weight?

However, Anant Ambani gained weight again and is now weighted 110 kgs. is facing medical challenges, and he also had body balancing issues. His excessive weight can be linked with Asthma. According to a 2023 study, suffering with asthma can likely develop obesity in adults. Those suffering with asthma are more likely to gain weight. These adults must take care of their weight management practices more than adults without asthma.

Anant Ambani's excessive weight is mainly the result of corticosteroids, a medication used against asthma. The corticosteroids efficiently reduce inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms from appearing, these also have side effects, just like many other medications. One of the biggest is obesity. From increasing appetite to reducing physical activity, its side effects are many. They also redistribute fat and retain fluids which allow more weight to settle.

With a massive weight range, lungs can be restricted which can result in breathing problems. Asthma can be triggered as fat tissue produces inflammatory substances that are likely to affect lungs. As Anant Ambani's birthday comes on April 10, we wish him a very happy birthday and also a great health.

The girl, who hails from Ashoknagar, Bhopal, had a fleshy bulge on the back of her neck since birth. After being admitted to AIIMS' neurosurgery department, MRI and CT scans were performed.

Doctors at AIIMS Bhopal successfully removed a parasitic twin from a three-year-old girl's skull and neck in a complex surgery. According to a report by India Today, the girl is recovering well now.

The girl, who hails from Ashoknagar, Bhopal, had a fleshy bulge on the back of her neck since birth. After being admitted to AIIMS, Bhopal's neurosurgery department, MRI and CT scans were performed.

According to India Today report, the scans revealed an incomplete body with a leg and pelvic bones attached to her skull and spine, near the brain stem, a very sensitive area of the brain.

Due to the case's complexity, surgery was planned for April 3 after discussions between Dr. Radha Gupta, Dr. Ankur (Radiology), Dr. Riyaz Ahmed (Pediatric Surgery), and Dr. Ved Prakash (Plastic Surgery).

"This case was related to a parasitic twin, in which an underdeveloped twin fetus was stuck to the skull and neck of a living girl. This incomplete twin child remains stuck to its fully developed twin. This incomplete twin cannot live on its own and is dependent on its twin," Prof Dr Ajay Singh, Executive Director of AIIMS Bhopal, told India Today TV.

What is parasitic twin?

A parasitic twin is a rare form of conjoined twins where one twin doesn't fully develop but remains attached to the other, which continues to grow, often with parts of the underdeveloped twin still connected.

Meanwhile, the surgery was conducted by Dr. Sumit Raj and Dr. Jitendra Shakya, with Dr. Abhishek assisting. The girl is now healthy and recovering.

It’s worth noting that Oxytocin, often called the "cuddle chemical," plays a key role in fostering trust, sexual arousal, and emotional bonding.

Hello folks! This week’s piece is about something that we don’t realise is a major giveaway on our love life; our skin. On good mood days or happy lovey dovey days your skin is going to be glowing like you’ve just discovered a giant pot of gold somewhere and on days where you’re probably not at your best behaviour you’re probably going to be breaking out like it’s high-school all over again.

Yup, trust me and my 14+ years of experience when I say this: your skin’s behaviour could be a guide to your love life. Yes, the “Love Glow” is Real and NOT Just Expert Highlighter Skills Have you ever felt so much happiness that it feels like you’re emanating a sort of glow? Like, it almost feels photoshopped in your pictures. That’s what people call the “love glow”, and you can try, but you can’t replicate it with filters because there is a certain science to it. When you’re in a happy relationship or you’re crushing it (metaphorically) in the dating game, your body pumps out a hormone called serotonin also known as the happy hormone and oxytocin, aka; the cuddle hormone.

It’s worth noting that Oxytocin, often called the "cuddle chemical," plays a key role in fostering trust, sexual arousal, and emotional bonding. Your oxytocin levels will rise during physical affection—like hugging—and peak during orgasm, reinforcing its connection to intimacy and relationship building. Not just that, oxytocin helps reduce your stress and anxiety levels by promoting a sense of calm that makes itself visible on your skin. Stress is nobody’s friend and can bring about or worsen existing skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, rosacea and acne. Our friend, oxytocin helps lower cortisol (the primary stress hormone) and keep stress-related skin issues in check.

The First-Time (for Everything…) Okay now, let’s look at the less glamorous side effect of dating and intimate relationships - acne. Yup. Have you ever noticed how people have acne breakouts right after their first time? Or what about those annoying breakouts when you’re in the middle of a lover’s spat? That acne is certainly not helping anyone. When you’re in a newly formed physical intimate relationship, your body goes into a rollercoaster mode; adrenaline, nerves and all your other hormones basically going “ME! MEE PAY ATTENTION TO ME FIRST!” Your body is probably thinking “What’s happening now? Do I fight it, flee from it, or fight for it?” And sometimes that level of intense questioning and stress can work itself out into a pimple that shows its annoying face right before date night. But you know what’s another thing that people don’t tell you about? The post-relationship-settle chill.

Basically, right after you settle into your relationship your skin decides “Yup, happy place, safe space, no stress.” Lower stress = lesser breakouts. Hey, Bryan Adams: Explain This Have you wondered why when you see that special someone you feel like someone’s holding a flame to your cheeks? Because suddenly, you’re feeling flushed and your cheeks turn pink looking like a

natural blush. This tomato look is nothing but increased blood flow that rushes to your skin to make it look rosy. An increased blood flow happens thanks to dopamine and adrenaline leading to your lips and cheeks getting pinker. So, Bryan Adams wasn’t entirely wrong about the blood rush; just that it doesn’t really rush to your knees scientifically speaking but it does rush to your face, lips and your private places, just saying. The Good and the Bad: Skin Habits with Pookie Now, just because you think you’ve found yourself a pookie, doesn’t mean you forget/flip your entire routine inside out. Sleeping at 3 am because you’ve been on the phone playing “You hang up…no, YOU hang up” or those extra glasses of wine because the conversation and laughter made you forget how to count - we’ve all been there at some point.

But here’s something you should know: your skin remembers. Going to sleep with your makeup on: Instant NO! Sleeping with your makeup on can lead to breakouts and no one wants that on a normal day let alone on date night.

More junk food intake: We’ve all let ourselves go at some point after getting comfortable in a new relationship. Just remember that inflammation is probably not something that you need to invite upon yourself. To remedy this, keep a travel-sized skincare pouch with all of your essentials on you or at their place so that your glow is never compromised.

So, How Do Relationships Improve Your Skin’s Glow?

So here’s the good news: being in a happy relationship can make your skin better. Let me tell you how: Cuddles = lesser

stress: Oxytocin is what gets triggered when there’s physical touch; hugs, kisses, etc. and because of its release cortisol levels are reduced. Lower stress hormone levels = fewer stress-related breakouts.

Being each other’s skincare motivation: Couples who motivate each other to stick to their skincare routines however basic they might be, stay youthful together. Studies reveal that your partner can influence your skincare habit.

Staying happy and hydrated: Like I mentioned earlier, your skin does glow when you’re happy because happiness boosts circulation and hydrates your skin. So, your takeaway from this? Try your best to stay happy folks! If you’re in a relationship

and you notice your skin’s giving the perfect main character energy then you’re probably thriving. If you’re looking at random and regular breakouts then maybe it’s time to give your relationship, situationship, a thorough detox.

Just know that your skin always remembers so don’t put yourself and your skin through a lacklustre commitment. So, keep it glowing, keep it healthy.

Your friendly skincare truth-teller.

Incorporating flaxseeds into daily diets for improved menstrual and menopausal health.

Menstruation and menopause are two significant phases in a woman’s life, both of which bring hormonal fluctuations that can impact overall well-being. Menstruation often comes with symptoms like cramps, bloating, fatigue, and mood swings, while menopause leads to hot flashes, mood changes, and hormonal imbalances. Maintaining a balanced diet can help alleviate these discomforts, and flaxseeds have emerged as a powerful superfood that can regulate hormonal health.

Nutrition expert Deepsikha Jain highlights the importance of incorporating flaxseeds into daily diets for improved menstrual and menopausal health. She explains that flaxseeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and a compound known as lignin, a type of phytoestrogen that helps regulate hormonal levels. These nutrients play a crucial role in reducing common menstrual symptoms such as cramps and mood swings while also easing menopausal symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats.

As Jain states, “Flaxseeds are not only rich in omega-3 fatty acids but also a compound known as lignin which is a type of phytoestrogen that will help regulate your hormonal levels. It will reduce the symptoms of menstruation and menopause. Not only that, eating flaxseeds will actually help you regulate your menstrual cycles as well. So please make sure that you consume at least 1 TSP of flaxseed every day for a better menstrual cycle. Share this with all the girls you know, follow for more such health tips.”

In addition to flaxseeds, other lifestyle changes can also help alleviate menstrual and menopausal symptoms. Regular exercise, such as yoga and light cardio, can improve circulation, reduce cramps, and boost mood by releasing endorphins. Staying hydrated and consuming foods rich in iron, magnesium, and vitamin B6, such as leafy greens, nuts, and bananas, can further support hormonal balance. Practicing stress-reducing techniques like meditation and deep breathing exercises can also contribute to a more comfortable menstrual cycle and menopause transition.

Lilly isn't alone in this, Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk - which markets blockbuster weight loss drug Ozempic - too had issued ads early this month on World Obesity Day.

Global pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has officially introduced Mounjaro (tirzepatide) to the Indian market, a highly anticipated drug designed to manage type 2 diabetes and obesity. This launch follows approval from the country’s drug regulatory authorities Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO).

What is Mounjaro?

Mounjaro is a prescription medication for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus or those seeking effective weight management. This groundbreaking drug works by activating two critical hormones, GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). Together, these hormones help regulate blood sugar levels, control appetite, and promote weight loss.

The drug is available in India as a single-dose vial, to be taken once weekly.

How Does Mounjaro Work?

Mounjaro’s mechanism targets multiple pathways for diabetes and obesity management. Its functions include:

Appetite reduction: The patient will feel less hungry.

Enhanced insulin release:

Improved insulin sensitivity

Slowed digestion

Minimizes the body’s tendency to store excess fat.

This multifaceted approach makes Mounjaro a significant advancement in managing both diabetes and obesity.

Cost of Moujaro

Priced at Rs 3,500 for a 2.5 mg vial and Rs 4,375 for a 5 mg vial, Mounjaro is usually taken once a week. Depending on the prescribed dosage, the monthly cost ranges between Rs 14,000 and Rs 17,500. In comparison, the average monthly price of Mounjaro in the United States is approximately $1,000–$1,200 (Rs 86,000–Rs 1 lakh).

Expert opinion

Dr Ashok Jhingan, an expert in endocrinology and diabetes, highlighted the safety and efficacy of Mounjaro, “Mounjaro is a safe drug that works by activating GLP-1 and GIP receptors, boosting incretin hormones in the body. This not only helps regulate blood sugar by promoting insulin production when required but also supports weight management and improves overall metabolic health. It’s a significant advancement in diabetes treatment, offering both efficacy and safety for patients.”

Virat Kohli gave the young batter an emphatic send-off, running towards the pitch and shouting something at Abhishek as he headed back to the dugout.

In the high octane match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH), Virat Kohli was seen celebrating Abhishek Sharma's dismissal with aggression during the IPL 2025 match at the Ekana International Stadium on Friday, May 23. As the left-handed batsman walked off the field looking disappointed, the former RCB captain took the opportunity to celebrate enthusiastically.

Abhishek had been batting aggressively against the RCB bowlers, particularly Bhuvneshwar Kumar, scoring 10 runs off the veteran seamer in just two deliveries. However, his innings ended in the fourth over when he was caught by a deep backward square leg fielder, having scored 34 runs off only 16 deliveries, seemingly on track for a significant score.

Following the dismissal, Kohli gave the young batter an emphatic send-off, running towards the pitch and shouting something at Abhishek as he headed back to the dugout. The SRH opener remained silent while Kohli spoke to him, seemingly showing respect to a cricketer of India's stature. Abhishek had previously taken issue a few days ago when LSG's Digvesh Rathi celebrated his dismissal.

Meanwhile, Kohli recently announced his Test retirement on May 12, which surprised many, as he was expected to play in India's upcoming five-match Test series in England, starting on June 20.

Coming back to the match, Pat Cummins and Nitish Reddy shine as Hyderabad post a commanding victory over Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) by 42 runs in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL), on Friday at Lucknow.

Ishan Kishan was the top scorer of the match, The batter scored 94 runs in just 48 balls, his innings included seven fours and five sixes. He was awarded player of the match for his outstanding batting display.

RCB were bowled out for 189-10, falling short of 42 runs to chase a massive target of 232. After this defeat, RCB is placed third in the IPL points table, with 17 points, eight wins, four defeats, and a no-result match. On the other hand, SRH is placed eighth with five wins and seven defeats in 13 matches; they have 10 points.

Cases of coronavirus are on the surge in India again. At present, there are a total of 312 patients of Covid-19. So far, 12 states and Union Territories have reported cases of the virus with most number of patients in being in Kerala (95).

Cases of coronavirus are on the surge in India again. At present, there are a total of 312 patients of Covid-19. So far, 12 states and Union Territories have reported cases of the virus with most number of patients in being in Kerala (95). The national capital, on the other hand, has reported 23 cases till date.

Pertinent to note that of the total 312 cases of Covid-19 in the country, a huge 161 are from south Indian states including Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Moreover, states and UTs including Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jammu and Kashmir have not reported any cases so far.

For the resurgence of the virus, a new variant JN.1 and its sub-variants LF7 and NB1.8 are responsible. Although there are less cases of Covid-19 in the country at present, several states have issued health advisories as a precautionary measure.

The Delhi government has directed all hospitals to make proper arrangements of beds, oxygen and medicines. Meanwhile, Haryana health minister Arti Rao has instructed the public to wear face masks and avoid visiting crowded places. Harayana has reported five cases of Covid-19 so far.

Similarly, the Karnataka government has appealed to people to follow social distancing and wear face masks -- the state has witnessed 16 cases of coronavirus so far.

A look at the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic

According to Worldometer, there were a total of 1,11,23,000 cases of corona as of March 1, 2021 -- which later increased to 3,04,53,000 as of July 1, 2021, implying there was an 173 per cent increase in the cases within merely four months.

In light of Rohit Sharma's departure, the selectors are also anticipated to name his successor, with Shubman Gill emerging as the leading candidate for the role.

The unexpected retirement of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma from Test cricket has created a significant void in the Indian cricket team as it prepares for the highly anticipated five-Test series against England in June. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is expected to announce the Test squad for this crucial tour on Saturday, May 24. In light of Rohit Sharma's departure, the selectors are also anticipated to name his successor, with Shubman Gill emerging as the leading candidate for the role.

In anticipation of the crucial upcoming meeting, Team India's head coach, Gautam Gambhir has finally addressed the unexpected retirements of two modern-day legends of Indian cricket which occurred within days of one another.

The former Indian batsman emphasized that players have the autonomy to decide their careers and futures. He asserted that neither coaches nor the nation has the authority to dictate when athletes should continue playing or retire.

“I think, when you start the game and when you want to finish, it’s a very individual decision. No one has the right. Be it the coach, the selector, be it anyone in this country has any right to tell someone when to retire and when not to retire. So it comes from within,” Gambhir told News18.

Gambhir added that Team India's experience would be much missed as they consider the difficulties they will have without their two most experienced players during the England tour. He was nevertheless sure that the young players would want to take advantage of the chance, just as they did when Jasprit Bumrah wasn't there at the Champions Trophy.

“And yes, we’ve got to be without two senior players, two really experienced players. And sometimes I believe that it’s the opportunity for some other people to put their hand up and say, Okay, I’m ready for it. So yes, it will be tough, but then there’ll be people putting their hand up for sure because this question was asked to me before.

“Champions Trophy as well. When Jusprit Bumrah wasn’t there and I said exactly the same thing, someone missing out might give another person an opportunity to do something special for the country, hopefully, there’ll be other guys waiting for that opportunity,” he added.

While Gill seems to be the top choice for stepping into the leadership role, there are also strong contenders like KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, and Jasprit Bumrah who are in the mix.

Made on a budget of Rs 3.25 crores, Darr earned Rs 21.3 crores at the box office. Darr also won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment at the 41st National Film Awards. But, the road to finalising the cast of Darr was not an easy undertaking.

When Yash Chopra's Darr was first released in the theatres in December 1993, only a few people could have imagined the impact it would have on Indian cinema. Darr not only became the third highest-grossing Hindi film of the year after its release, but also helped establish Shah Rukh Khan as a superstar. The film starred Sunny Deol and Juhi Chawla in the lead roles, but it was Shah Rukh Khan in the role of an antagonist, Rahul Mehra, that drew all the attention. Made on a budget of Rs 3.25 crores, Darr earned Rs 21.3 crores at the box office. Darr also won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment at the 41st National Film Awards. But, despite the popularity of the film and the unique script, the road to finalising the cast of Darr was not an easy undertaking.

Darr redefined Hindi cinema villain and shot Shah Rukh Khan and Juhi Chawla's careers to superstardom, however, the film encountered significant casting limitations before its release.

Yash Chopra was initially keen on casting Sridevi in the lead role, but after she demanded changes in the script, the idea was dropped. Yash Chopra then approached Madhuri Dixit, who rejected the film because she wasn't aligned with its storyline. Aishwarya Rai was also approached, but she refused to play the part due to other commitments. Divya Bharti was also approached to play the lead role in Darr, however, Kiran's character was ultimately meant to be played by Juhi Chawla, who did it with much grace.

The role of Sunil, Kiran’s fiancé, was also rejected by actors like Rishi Kapoor, Mithun Chakraborty, and Jackie Shroff before Sunny Deol agreed to play it.

The most important aspect of the film was the casting of Rahul Mehra, the primary antagonist of the film. The first choice of the makers, Sanjay Dutt, was arrested in connection with the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts. Ajay Devgn also rejected the offer. Aamir Khan was then considered to play the role, but soon exited the project due to creative differences.

Shah Rukh Khan, a relatively new actor, was then cast as Rahul Mehra in Darr and permanently redefined the Hindi film villain. His iconic 'I love you, K-K-K-Kiran', to this date, remains one of Bollywood’s most iconic dialogues.

According to reports, the Central Board of Film Certification has finally cleared the film with a U/A certificate after 16 major changes before getting the go-ahead.

Triptii Dimri and Siddhant Chaturvedi are all set to sizzle on the big screen with Dhadak 2, the sequel to the 2018 film, Dhadak. For the first time, the two will be sharing the screen space for the movie, directed by Shazia Iqbal under Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions. As the anticipation around the grows, there is the latest update around its censorship. According to reports, the Central Board of Film Certification has finally cleared the film with a U/A certificate, after 16 major changes before getting a go-ahead.

Reportedly, Dhadak 2 underwent several edits to address concerns flagged by the CBFC. A dialogue with political undertones was reworked to avoid references to any public figure. Even caste-related terms were muted or replaced with alternatives to avoid hurting sentiments. A religious dialogue was modified from "Dharam ka kaam hai" to "Punya ka kaam hai". A couplet by Tulsidas in a song was replaced with a verse about quiet resistance. The line "3,000 years of backlog will not be cleared in just 70 years" was toned down to "the backlog of age-old discrimination will not be cleared in just 70 years."

There have been several other edits that involved removing a dog's blue colour in a mystical scene. The 16 seconds were chopped from an insult scene. A violent scene against a woman with a black screen was replaced. Also, the disclaimer at the start of the film has been extended to 1 minute and 51 seconds, which is now read aloud.

Dhadak 2 was announced last year and its motion poster was well-appreciated by fans. Taking to Instagram, Karan shared a captivating motion poster featuring Siddhant Chaturvedi and Triptii Dimri. The poster shows Siddhant and Triptii's characters embracing, with a poignant voiceover by Siddhant’s character, Neelesh, who says, "Jo sapna tum dekh rahi ho Vidhi, usme mere liye koi jagah nahi hai," which translates to "The dream that you have, Vidhi, there's no place for me in it." Triptii's character, Vidhi, responds with a heart-wrenching question, "Toh phir yeh bhi bata do Neelesh, ki in feelings ka kya karun," meaning "Then tell me, Neelesh, what to do with these feelings?"



Dhadak 2 was initially slated to release on November 22, 2024. After multiple delays, the makers are yet to announce the final release date.

DNA Zee News anchor, Sourabh Raaj Jain today analysed the focus of Lok Sabha Elections 2024 shifting from development to Hindu-Muslim politics

Discussions for the Lok Sabha polls in 2024 initially focused on growth and development. But now the focus has been shifted to the benefits from development—based on categories, religions, and castes. This change brought religious issues into the campaign discourse. Sourabh Raaj Jain, anchor of DNA Zed News today, analysed how the focus of the 2024 Lok Sabha election will change from development to religion.

Speeches during election rallies shifted from reservations to religious reservations, and concerns regarding the division of land among various faiths surfaced. Lately, the discourse has intensified to an eighty-twenty proportions gulf, prompting conversations concerning Ghazwa-e-Hind via religious reservation.

It raises the fundamental question: does the Hindu-Muslim divide affect actual life, or is it confined to electoral politics?

In general, no party is exclusive when it comes to incorporating religious themes into politics. A review of several remarks shows that religious overtones work well for all political parties during elections.

The remarks made by BJP leader and Amravati candidate Navneet Rana reflect this viewpoint. Rana challenged Akbaruddin Owaisi and his brother Asaduddin Owaisi in Hyderabad, saying if police were removed from duty for 15 seconds, the brothers "would not know from where they came and where they went"

"I always stand by my statement. I am not afraid of anyone. We are committed to giving a reply to those who are working for Pakistan in India. If they will take 15 minutes, we will take 15 seconds," Navneet Rana said. Rana was heard saying in a video clip she posted on her X handle, tagging the Owaisi brothers, "The younger brother says, 'Remove the police for 15 minutes so that we can show them what we can do'. I want to tell the younger brother (Akbaruddin) that it might take you 15 minutes, but it will only take us 15 seconds. It will take us all of 15 seconds if we come to the forefront."Reacting to BJP leader Navneet Rana's "15-second lagenge" remark, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give her one hour instead of 15 seconds and asserted they are not "scared" of the BJP leader.

"I tell Modi ji - give her 15 seconds. What will you do? Give her 15 seconds, give her 1 hour. We, too, want to see if you have any humanity left in you. Who is scared? We are ready...If someone is making an open call for it, then so be it. PM is yours; RSS is yours; everything is yours. Do it. Who is stopping you? Tell us where we have to come, we will be there. Do it," Owaisi told reporters on Thursday.

At a meeting in 2013, Akbaruddin warned "100 crore Hindus" that his community would show what it could do if the police were withdrawn for '15 minutes'. After fellow party member Navneet Rana's '15 seconds lagenge' remark stoked controversy, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Madhavi Latha on Thursday said that the former wanted to convey to the citizens that it will only take 15 seconds to cast their vote, which will help the nation move towards 'Viksit Bharat'.

Speaking to ANI, BJP's Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat candidate, Madhavi Latha, said, "We do not threaten anyone. We do not say to remove the police force for 15 minutes. We just want to say that you should take 15 seconds instead of 15 minutes and cast your vote. Do not go to attend provocative speeches. If you want to move towards 'Viksit Bharat'. Go and cast your vote. This is what she (Navneet Rana) meant.

Asaduddin Owaisi, the leader of AIMIM and a four-time member of the Lok Sabha, presents a difficult opponent for Latha. This is the first time a female candidate from the Hyderabad constituency has been fielded by the BJP. The Owaisi family has maintained a stronghold in Hyderabad.

It is noteworthy that in 2022, the Sessions Court cleared Akbaruddin of all charges despite his 2013 speech earning him a 40-day jail sentence. This was due to insufficient evidence. The police are accused of providing biassed evidence to protect Akbaruddin, and the case is still being investigated by the High Court.

One would wonder why Barrister Owaisi did not bring up his acquittal in the midst of all of this. Maybe the resurfacing of an eleven-year-old grudge doesn't affect him too much.

A video featuring Union Home Minister Amit Shah asserting that the BJP will do away with 'unconstitutional reservations' for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) is doing the rounds on social media during the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. However, the research finds that this video was altered and circulated to spread false information.

The video caused controversy when it was uploaded on social media by several accounts, including official Congress accounts. The accounts claimed that the doctored tape showed the BJP's 'agenda to abolish SC/ST reservation quotas.' BJP officials have taken issue with these statements, accusing the Congress of spreading misleading information that could cause societal unrest.

Amid Lok Sabha elections 2024, ZEE News anchor Sourabh Raaj Jain analyzed the threats that technology poses to the nation's democracy in the digital era

Amit Shah, the Home Minister, is allegedly heard saying in a video released on the social networking site X on April 28 at 6:42 am that the 'unconstitutional reservation' for SC, ST, and OBC will be eliminated if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins power. The user added, "We will end SC-ST and OBC reservation: Home Minister Amit Shah," to the post. On social media, this video has rapidly garnered popularity and generated conversation.

The Delhi Police on Sunday registered a case over a doctored video circulating on social media platforms. The video, which has sparked controversy and allegations of misinformation, has prompted the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to file a complaint seeking action against those responsible for it.

PM Modi on Monday also targeted political rivals for circulating a tampered video of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. PM Modi said addressing an election rally in Maharashtra's Satara that it's due to the fear of losing the elections that the opposition is spreading fake news. He cautioned people against falling for fake information generated through such videos.

The CBI conducted raids in several locations in Delhi and Haryana on Friday night in response to a tip.

Two newborns, one who was 15 days old and the other who was just two days old, were saved after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) busted a syndicate of child traffickers on Friday night. Seven people were detained by the agency for their involvement in the sale of newborns to childless couples via Facebook and WhatsApp advertisements.

Under the operation, CBI conducted searches at seven locations across Delhi and Haryana.

In today's DNA, Zee News anchor Ram Mohan Sharma analysed the 'Modus Operandi' of the child traffic racket in the national capital.

The CBI conducted raids in several locations in Delhi and Haryana on Friday night in response to a tip. Three newborns were rescued and seven people were taken into custody from a house in Delhi's Keshavpuram neighbourhood. Two boys, one and a half days and fifteen days old, respectively, and a baby girl, approximately one-month-old, are among them. These babies were either taken from various locations or obtained for sale, according to CBI authorities, who also said that the buyers and the woman who helped with the transactions were among the people arrested.

The accused were presented in court, and seven of the accused were remanded to the custody of the CBI. The masterminds of this illegal network are Indu and Neeraj, according to the agency. According to reports, this network obtained infants from hospitalised parents or surrogate mothers and then used Facebook and WhatsApp to find possible adoptive parents. After that, they would forge adoption paperwork to make it easier to sell these kids.

According to the CBI, this group sold infants for between Rs 4 and Rs 6 lakh on the illicit market, treating them like commodities. According to sources, this group has probably trafficked ten or so infants in the last month. Furthermore, the network's activities extend beyond the Delhi NCR area, involving staff members from other prestigious hospitals in different states. More shockingly, the mastermind of this gang has been identified as a government official, purportedly an Assistant Labour Commissioner.

The CBI notes that it is still conducting its probe into this child trafficking network and anticipates learning further information. It is expected that other people connected to different hospitals would be taken into custody, as several people, including a hospital ward boy, have already been arrested. It's unclear how far this syndicate has spread, but more arrests are probably on the way.

Zee News recently conducted a sting operation which has exposed ugly 'car-nama' of some showrooms.

There are several high-demand cars which have high waiting periods. Customers get the delivery of such cars after several months despite booking them in advance. But in a sting operation by Zee News, it was revealed how some dealers provide cars with high waiting periods in just one day after taking extra money from customers.

Zee News recently conducted Operation Car-Nama, in which, it was revealed how some showrooms of Maruti and Hyundai in several cities charging extra money. The sting operation shows senior staff in some showrooms are asking for Rs 70,000 to Rs 80,000 for instant delivery of cars that have long waiting lists.

Some cars have high waiting periods of 6-12 months, but these showrooms are claiming to provide such cars in just one day after customers give extra money. The Zee News team visited five states -- Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand. Check out the video here:

Naina spoke at length on her 16-year journey on the platform, and how she sees the major revamp that Musk tends to bring to the social media giant.

On October 28, 2022, Elon Musk acquired an unprofitable company at USD 44 million, and it now seems that he is making every desperate attempt to coup his losses. His plan of action not only included massive layoffs and harsh diktat for employees (12 hours a day shift, no rest day), but also an intent to make the ‘highly coveted’ blue tick payable at USD 8 per month (approx. Rs 650 per month).

While the second move seems to have been scrubbed in wake of the storm of fake handles getting the ‘Verified’ badge, industry experts believe that Musk’s ‘stunts’ might leave the social media giant in the lurch.

According to Statista, Twitter has about 23.6 million users (as of January 2022) in India. However, India reportedly accounts only for a small percentage of Twitter’s revenue. The registered entity of Twitter in India recorded Rs 86.39 crore as revenue in FY21. But this was just 0.23 percent of the global revenue. In FY22, though its revenue jumped by about 82 percent, to Rs 156.75 crore, the India entity posted a net loss of Rs 31.84 crore for FY22.

Amid all the chaos around Twitter and its owner Musk making headlines almost every day, we thought of discussing this fiasco with someone who has been long associated with Twitter and got the opportunity to have a detailed discussion with Naina Redhu, arguably the first Twitter user in India. Naina spoke at length on her 16-year journey on Twitter and how she sees the major revamp that Elon Musk tends to bring to the social media platform.

Here are the edited excerpts of the interview:

Since when have you been on the platform? How did you end up signing onto the platform?

I signed up to the platform in 2006, back when it was called TWTTR. I had a job in Mumbai and I was very interested in the way the internet was coming up and blogging was a thing, at least abroad, not in India. I started my first blog in 2004 so I was quite involved with the things that were happening online.



How was your experience back then?

Back then, I think I remember very clearly that I signed on and I was very curious to know what was happening. I saw that there were a few people who were writing texts on the screen and they were talking as if they already knew each other. I noticed that all of them were located in Palo Alto, California and they were all planning to meet up for a coffee or a pizza. And I was just hoping that there was somebody in Bombay that I could say that to. But there was no one else. I thought that maybe the platform is only for the US audience and it wasn’t meant for someone in India.

Is that how you figured out that you were the first Twitter user?

Someone told me that ‘I think you might be the first twitter user from India.’ They then pointed me to an article that said ‘The first 140 people to sign up to Twitter’ and when I checked it out I couldn’t find a single Indian or an India-sounding name on that list. I thought that this could be true. I then wrote an article on my blog ‘Am I the first Indian Twitter user?’ A lot of people responded by saying that they cannot find any other Indian user. No one really dug deep but its commonly thought that I am the first Twitter user from India.

What have been the drastic changes that you have noticed from 2006 to 2022?

One was of course the character limit change. From 140 to 280 characters which I think took away the essence of Twitter because with 140 characters, what I used to do was try really hard to compress what I was talking about in 140 characters. But with the 280 characters and the whole ‘thread-system’, it has become like a blog.

One thing that I miss is the ‘Fail Whale’ where a blue color whale popped up when the platform would crash because, maybe, they could not keep up with the demand of the users all over the world. The ‘Fail Whale’ has gone which is great for Twitter and the services that they provide but I miss it because once in a while, we would go like ‘Oh yeah, even I saw a Fail Whale. Did you see it?’

But the community aspect of Twitter has been lost. And I haven't seen it coming back. I remember going for ‘Tweet-Ups’ for everyone who is on Twitter who would've met or chatted, we would go to a restaurant, meet them, chat, have food and actually get to know the person in real life. I don’t think anyone would ever do that, on Twitter at least. The platform was a lot more of learning, talking to new people, learning about new things etc.

The platform has become a lot more politics, and a lot more controversial topics are talked about which is not really a bad thing but I do feel that the personal touch in the smaller community aspect has definitely gone which I miss.

After Elon musk’s takeover, there have been a bunch of changes on the platform. The company was recently planning to impose subscription fee for the verification badge. Do you think people would be willing to pay for the blue tick?

I don’t have clarity over it yet because I saw that screenshots were shared with 2 badges. One was the blue tick and the other was the ‘Official’ tag. I think they are still trying to decide what to do with the blue tick because the verification sign has always been there to determine or to verify that this is the real person in real life who is also on Twitter. They are trying to change that but I am not sure what it will mean, yet.

The USD 8 dollars initially was for Twitter Blue subscription where you could see lesser ads and there were a bunch of other features. But why would I pay money to see lesser ads? If taking money, then say no ads. Although I don’t use Twitter as much anymore.

Elon Musk had tweeted that they are experimenting different things on the platform and they will see what works and what doesn’t. Was it the same earlier?

That’s what I loved about twitter. That’s what it used to be. In the early days when it had started picking up, there was a lot of stuff happening and we would give feedback to Twitter and they would respond by saying that they are trying out stuff. I know that Elon is a very polarising figure. There are some people who love him and some who absolutely hate him and there is no middle ground. But I think that he is trying something and I am really excited to see what happens and where it goes. The blue tick has represented something till now but we don’t know about now. It might change, it might not change.

Twitter Blue was going to roll out the ‘edit’ button. But with Elon Musk’s takeover, things might change.

Right, we don’t have much clarity over what might happen. And honestly, I have survived Twitter without the ‘edit’ button for 16 years, I am not going to pay for it.

We pay a subscription fee to a lot of platforms like, say, Netflix and we get to watch movies in return. What about Twitter? Do you think that the USD 8 per month fee will be worth it?

No. I don’t know, honestly. I really need to know what the blue tick would mean in the future. And if it is adding value, then, yeah, sure. The value it has added so far is that people know that it’s actually me that they're talking to, it’s me who they’re getting in touch with. I don’t think that the blue tick adds value to me in any way. Again, I would really need to see where it's going and what they're planning to do, to be honest.

Even if we don’t have verified accounts, the normal accounts still add value to a platform like twitter.

Don’t you think that the blue tick helps us differentiate between the parody/fake accounts from the actual/verified accounts?

If it’s a political figure, I think it's important for them to have a blue tick to say that this is in fact the real person. I don’t face the same issues that Narendra Modi or Rahul Gandhi would face. And I'm sure that politicians have deep pockets and paying those $8 dollars would be nothing for them.

Do you think that the subscription plan would be successful in India, given that all the plan provides is a verification badge?

I will not subscribe. I cannot say for anyone else in India but I wouldn’t take the plan. The reason I have, say, a Spotify premium account is because I don’t want to listen to ads. I have twitter and I can’t really delete my account since I am the first user but paying Twitter the money wouldn’t add any value to my life so I don’t see why I would subscribe to anything on Twitter.

Don’t you think that if Twitter takes this up, other platforms might start their own subscription plan for a ‘no-ad’ policy?

No, I don’t think so. What other platforms are there, really? If you talk about Instagram, it's really hard to decipher if it's an ad, a paid promotion, or just some page that I already follow. There are some ads that are actually useful and I really like. Instagram’s ad algorithm is really quick and picks up what you’re looking for but that’s not the case with Twitter. Twitter really needs to work on its ad algorithm.

Do you think people are migrating to other platforms like Koo or Mastodon?

I have heard of a lot of platforms and have tried them but they can't compete with what twitter has to offer, the loyalty that Twitter has had. They were the first platform to do what they did and it took off for them. So, I think no one can compete with Twitter. Even if people don’t end up paying the $8, they will continue using the free account but they're not migrating to another platform. Twitter has the audience and the major population on it. Unless there is a mass exodus and Elon Musk really messes it up, I don’t it's going to change. Everybody wants to be where everyone else is.

This is the most people have spoken about Twitter on Twitter. I'm really excited with what Musk plans to do with the platform.

IPL 2025, Punjab Kings vs Delhi Capitals: Delhi Capitals snapped their losing streak by defeating PBKS in Jaipur, thanks to Sameer Rizvi's impressive unbeaten score of 59 in pursuit of a 207-run target.

The race for the top two positions remains highly competitive as the Delhi Capitals concluded their IPL campaign with a remarkable victory over the heavily favored Punjab Kings on Saturday. Sameer Rizvi shone brightly, achieving his maiden IPL half-century, while Karun Nair contributed a crucial 44 runs to propel their team to success.

Punjab Kings set a formidable target of 208 runs for Delhi Capitals, with Shreyas Iyer also scoring a half-century and Marcus Stoinis delivering an explosive performance with a rapid 44 runs off just 16 balls. Despite losing wickets at regular intervals, Punjab maintained a strong run rate, thanks in part to the efforts of Mustafizur Rahman and Kuldeep Yadav, who claimed three and two wickets, respectively. Vipraj Nigam also took two wickets, but the Punjab batters aggressively targeted Mohit Sharma and Mukesh Kumar, enabling them to amass a substantial total.

Neehal Wadhera (16) struggled to find his rhythm and was dismissed by Mukesh Kumar. Mustafizur then claimed his second wicket, taking down Shashank Singh (11) as Punjab Kings (PBKS) lost their fifth wicket at a total of 144 runs. Captain Shreyas Iyer (53) notched yet another half-century before falling to Kuldeep Yadav, who, just four deliveries later, also dismissed Azmat Omarzai (1). Mustafizur struck once more in the final over, removing Marco Jansen (0). However, Marcus Stoinis showcased his explosive batting, finishing with an impressive unbeaten 44 runs off just 16 balls, propelling PBKS past the 200-run mark to conclude their innings at 206 for 8.

In response, Delhi Capitals (DC) started strongly, accumulating 55 runs for the first wicket before KL Rahul (35) was dismissed by Marco Jansen. Faf du Plessis (23) followed suit in the next over, as PBKS mounted a robust comeback. Sediqullah Atal (22) was the next to fall, succumbing to Praveen Dubey.

Amidst the pressure, Karun Nair (44) found his form and steadied the innings for DC before being clean bowled by Harpreet Brar. Ultimately, Sameer Rizvi (58 not out) and Tristan Stubbs (18 not out) formed an unbroken partnership of 53 runs for the fifth wicket, leading DC to victory by six wickets with three balls remaining.

Earlier, Delhi Capitals won the toss and chose to bat first against the Punjab Kings. Notably, Axar Patel was unavailable for Delhi, leading Faf du Plessis to take the helm as captain for this match.

After a strong start to the season, RCB's chances of finishing in the top two are now uncertain and depend on other results. On Tuesday, they must perform perfectly to secure their position.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru faced a tough 42-run loss against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Friday in Lucknow, a result that has really shaken up the playoff race as we head into the final stretch of IPL 2025’s league phase. The match which was supposed to take place in Bengaluru, was moved to the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium due to some logistical issues but unfortunately that change didn’t turn the tide for RCB.

This marked RCB’s fourth defeat of the season and with only one league game remaining they’re now hanging on to third place in the points table with 17 points from 13 matches. They’re tied on points with Punjab Kings but are behind Shreyas Iyer’s team when it comes to net run rate.

The situation is straightforward yet nerve-wracking for Rajat Patidar’s squad. If RCB can secure a win against Lucknow Super Giants on May 27 and get some favorable results – especially losses for Gujarat Titans and Punjab Kings in their remaining games – they could still clinch the top spot. A second-place finish is also within reach if RCB wins and only one of GT or PBKS manages to win in their last matches.

However, things could get tricky if RCB doesn’t manage to beat LSG. A loss in Lucknow might drop them to fourth place, particularly if both PBKS and GT come out on top in their final games. If GT wins against CSK on May 25 and PBKS takes both their remaining matches against DC (May 24) and MI (May 26), RCB’s defeat would push them out of the top two, making their path to the final much tougher.

Finishing in the top two guarantees a spot in Qualifier 1, set for May 29 in Mullanpur, giving teams two chances to reach the final. On the other hand, landing in third or fourth place means they’ll have to enter the first qualifier through the Eliminator on May 30, also in Mullanpur, with the winner then facing the loser of Qualifier 1 in Ahmedabad on June 1.

Dinesh Karthik, who has shared the same dressing room with Virat and has been with him since the announcement of the surprising decision, revealed the 36-year-old is enjoying the sport.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) batting coach Dinesh Karthik gave a sneak peek into stalwart Virat Kohli's life after he bid adieu to Test cricket earlier this month and said that the 36-year-old is at his "happiest now".

Virat penned a heartfelt note on Instagram to announce his retirement from the format he cherished the most. Virat's announcement came days after his long-time compatriot Rohit Sharma retired from red-ball cricket. The duo's decision has left India threadbare in the experience department weeks before embarking on a gruelling Test tour of England.

The Indian batting mainstay is part of Bengaluru in the 18th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Karthik, who has shared the same dressing room with Virat and has been with him since the announcement of the surprising decision, revealed the 36-year-old is enjoying the sport.

"It came as a shock to the outside world, so we are just observing what Virat is up to. he is at his happiest now, he is enjoying the sport, he really wants to spend his time with his family. It's a personal decision, we respect it, and as everyone else, oh, this is happening, but the fact is, it's great to see him happy and ready whenever we want him to play. The key is to keep him in good spirits," Karthik said on Thursday.

Virat's 14-year journey in the whites transformed India into a result-producing machine. He infused aggression and the culture of fitness into a team riddled with youth and experience. In a career that redefined the demands of the game, Virat scored 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, with 30 centuries and 31 fifties, and finished as India's fourth-highest run-getter in the format.

Virat's retirement from red-ball cricket marked the continuation of the exodus trend from the Test format in the Indian setup. Before the Indian batting bigwigs, the illustrious frontline off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin called it a day on his international career midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.

United States President Donald Trump has said, “It is okay for Apple to go to India to build its plants, but then the tech company will not be able to sell its products in America without tariffs." Trump's remarks came as he signed multiple executive orders in the Oval Office.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said, “It is ok for Apple to go to India to build its plants, but then the tech company will not be able to sell its products in America without tariffs." Mr. Trump's remarks came as he signed multiple executive orders in the Oval Office to boost the U.S nuclear power. "I had an understanding with Tim [Cook] that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, ‘That's okay to go to India, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs.’ And that's the way it is,” Mr. Trump said on Friday (May 23, 2025). “We're talking about the iPhone. If they're going to sell it in America, I want it to be built in the United States,” he said.

Early on Friday (May 23, 2025), Mr. Trump said in a social media post that he expects Apple iPhones that will be sold in the US to be manufactured in America and “not India, or anyplace else”, threatening to put a 25% tariff on the tech company’s products if it does not comply.

“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Mr. Trump said.

Just last week, Mr. Trump had said in Doha during his visit to the Middle East that he had told the Apple CEO to not build in India and instead build its manufacturing capacity in the US. “We have Apple, as you know, that's coming in, and I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Mr. Trump had said in Doha in remarks to top executives.



“I said to him, ‘Tim, you’re my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India. You can build in India if you want to take care of India because India is the highest, one of the highest—tariff nations in the world. It’s very hard to sell into India. And they’ve [India] offered us a deal where, basically, they’re willing to literally charge us no tariff,” he had said.

Earlier this month, Mr. Cook had said in a Q2, 2025 Earnings Conference call that the existing tariffs that apply to Apple today are based on the product's country of origin. "For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the U.S,” Mr. Cook had said.

On Mr. Trump calling for Apple to shift iPhone production from India to the U.S., research firm Counterpoint Research Research Director Tarun Pathak had said last week that “this is a familiar Trump tactic, He wants to push Apple to localise more and build a supply chain in the U.S, which is not going to happen overnight. Making in the U.S. will also be much more expensive than assembling iPhones in India.”

Counterpoint Research Vice President Neil Shah said that “Apple has been doing a lot of groundwork in India, which has helped it successfully manage some of the U.S. iPhone demand from its India production facilities”.



“In terms of capacity, India has enough to potentially meet all U.S. iPhone demand in the future, but the ecosystem needs to be ramped up. We will see more efforts towards this as well as products beyond iPhones. We expect made-in-India iPhones to account for 25%-30% of global iPhone shipments in 2025, as compared to 18% in 2024.”

He was born into a very poor family and was affected by polio, which left him handicapped for life.

Vishal Mega Mart is a name known to many Indians. It is a name very popular among middle-class families for offering groceries, and fashion at affordable prices. But behind this successful brand is the inspiring story of a man who started with almost nothing. His name is Ram Chandra Agarwal.

Agarwal founded Vishal Mega Mart in 2001-2002. With a focus on providing quality products at reasonable prices, the brand quickly became one of the fastest-growing retail chains in India. But Ram Chandra’s journey to success was not easy.

He was born into a very poor family and was affected by polio, which left him handicapped for life. Despite these challenges, he was determined to improve his life. His first business venture was a small photocopy shop, which didn’t last long. But it gave him the confidence to explore more opportunities.

Later, he opened a clothing store in Kolkata’s Lal Bazaar. He ran this shop successfully for 15 years before deciding to take a big leap. He shut down the Kolkata store and moved to Delhi to start a new retail business. This new venture eventually became Vishal Mega Mart.

However, the journey took a tough turn during the 2008 global financial crisis. The company suffered a huge loss of Rs 750 crore. This forced Ram Chandra to sell the Vishal brand, which was reportedly valued at Rs 2000 crore, for just Rs 70 crore to Shriram Group and TPG Capital.

But Ram Chandra Agarwal didn’t give up. He made a strong comeback by starting a new retail company—V2 Retail. Today, V2 Retail is one of the fastest-growing retail brands in India, with over 150 stores across the country.

Ram Chandra Agarwal’s journey is a powerful reminder that failure is not the end. From a photocopy shop owner to a retail giant, and even after losing a company once, he rose again to challenge some of India’s biggest business names. His story continues to inspire countless others who dream of making it big, no matter where they start.

CR Subramanian, an alumnus of both IIM and IIT Madras, initially made his mark as an engineer and banker. His entrepreneurial journey began in May 1991 with the founding of Viswapriya, a company that provided financial services.

You must have heard the saying 'Zero to Peak' many times, but today we are going to tell the story of a person who started from zero and built a company with a turnover of 4000 crores on his own. CR Subramanian, a man who once enjoyed a reputation as a successful engineer, banker, and entrepreneur, is now serving a 20-year prison sentence following his conviction for financial fraud. This marks a dramatic fall from grace for a figure who was once highly regarded in the business world.

Who is CR Subramanian?

He is an alumnus of both IIM and IIT Madras, initially made his mark as an engineer and banker. His entrepreneurial journey began in May 1991 with the founding of Viswapriya, a company that provided financial services. Viswapriya quickly gained traction, successfully attracting major investors with its appealing schemes, and thus setting the stage for Subramanian's entry into the business arena. He started his business from zero and late with his hardwork opened 1600 outlets across India.

When CR Subramanian started his business?

In 1997, Subramanian launched Subhiksha, a retail chain that expanded rapidly, eventually operating over 1,600 outlets throughout India. However, Subramanian's fortunes shifted dramatically when it was revealed that he had defrauded numerous investors by diverting their funds into shell companies.

Why CR Subramanian is convicted?

In November 2023, a special court in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, convicted him of defrauding hundreds of investors, sentencing him to 20 years in prison. The court's order confirmed that CR Subramanian had channeled investor assets through a network of shell companies.

Reports indicate that Subramanian has failed to make voluntary deposits for the past decade and has defaulted on over Rs 137 crore owed to depositors across various programs. In addition to the prison sentence, the court has imposed an Rs 8.92 crore fine on Subramanian and a collective fine of Rs 191.98 crore on his companies, with Rs 180 crore allocated for compensating affected depositors.

What was court's order?

According to the court order, these compensation funds, once received by the defaulters, will be transferred to an authorised organisation. This organisation will review documentation submitted by impacted investors and distribute the funds accordingly.

Currently, 587 of Subramaniam's investors are still awaiting reimbursement for their losses.

Wipro Executive Chairman Rishad Premji's remuneration more than doubled to $1.6 million (about Rs 13.7 crore) but was still less than company CEO Srinivas Pallia's earnings.

Wipro's Executive Chairman Rishad Premji's compensation more than doubled to USD 1.6 million in FY25, driven by an 18.9% rise in net profit. CEO Srinivas Pallia, who assumed the role in April 2024, earned USD 6.2 million, significantly less than his predecessor. Both Premji and Pallia are entitled to a commission based on incremental consolidated net profits.

Wipro Executive Chairman Rishad Premji's remuneration more than doubled to $1.6 million (about Rs 13.7 crore) but was still less than company CEO Srinivas Pallia's earnings of $6.2 million (about Rs 53.64 crore) in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, according to the company's latest annual report.

Premji, in the fiscal year 2023-24, did not take any commission since the company's incremental consolidated net profit for the year was negative, and took a pay cut of about 20 per cent with a salary of $769,456 (about Rs 6.4 crore), PTI reported.

However, during the 2024-25 fiscal year, with the Bengaluru-headquartered firm reporting an 18.9 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 13,135.4 crore, Premji's remuneration more than doubled to $1.6 million (about Rs 13.7 crore) in FY25, from $769,456 (about Rs 6.4 crore) in FY24, Wipro's 20-F filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed.

Srinivas Pallia, who assumed the role of CEO and Managing Director on April 7, 2024, received a total compensation of $6.2 million (about Rs 53.64 crore) in FY25.Pallia's takeaway is less than half that of Wipro's former CEO Thierry Delaporte, who drew a salary of $20 million (about Rs 168 crore) in FY24.

The document showed that Pallia earned about $1.7 million in salary and allowances, about $1.7 million as commission/variable pay, about $2.8 million classified as 'others', and $68,850 as long-term compensation.

Rishad Premji and Srinivas Pallia are entitled to a commission at the rate of 0.35 per cent on incremental consolidated net profits of the company over the previous fiscal year, the filing said.Further, Pallia was granted 16,77,202 stock options for varying lock-in periods. There were no stock options granted to Premji in FY25.

Russia intensifies strikes across Ukraine

A resident looks at an apartment building that was damaged in a Russian drone strike on Kyiv

Saturday's strikes, which killed 13 people across Ukraine, come as diplomatic efforts to end the fighting have resulted in prisoner exchanges, but Russia has not accepted calls for a ceasefire.

The attack was the second large-scale assault on the country in 48 hours, coming a day after the Ukrainian capital Kyiv suffered one of the heaviest assaults since the start of the Russian invasion.

At least 12 people, including three children, were killed and dozens injured in Russian drone and missile strikes, regional officials and emergency services said.

Russia has intensified strikes on Ukraine overnight, with widespread attacks across the country affecting most regions.

This includes Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.

Hectic two weeks leaves Russia confident - and peace in Ukraine feeling no closer

Ukraine's air force said that since 20:40 on Saturday local time (17:40 GMT), Russia had carried out strikes using 367 missiles of various types, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones.

The air force said it had shot down 45 cruise missiles and neutralised 266 UAVs, with most regions in Ukraine affected.

The air force recorded hits in 22 locations and downed cruise missiles and UAVs in 15 areas.

The strikes mark an intensification from the previous night, when Ukraine's air force said Russia attacked with 14 ballistic missiles and 250 UAV and drones, affecting six regions.

Deaths were reported in multiple regions after Saturday's overnight strikes.

In the Kyiv region, four people were killed and 16 injured, including three children, Ukraine's state emergencies service DSNS said.

Kyiv regional head Mykola Kalashnyk posted photos on social media of several houses set ablaze after the Russian strikes.

In the capital, Kyiv, local officials reported 11 injuries, multiple fires and damage to residential buildings, including a dormitory.

Hundreds of people were seen sheltering in underground stations of the city's metro. It comes as the capital marks its annual Kyiv Day holiday on Sunday.

Khmelnytskyi regional head Serhiy Tyurin said on Facebook that four people were killed and five were injured.

"Six private houses were destroyed, and another 20 damaged," he added.

In Zhytomyr, DSNS said three children aged eight, 12 and 17 were killed, 10 people injured and private homes "destroyed and damaged".

DSNS also said the body of an elderly man was pulled out from a five-storey residential building hit by a drone in Mykolaiv. Another five people were injured.

In Kharkiv, regional authorities reported three injuries.

In Russia, the defence ministry said 110 Ukrainian drones were destroyed and intercepted over 12 Russian regions and the Crimea peninsula between midnight and 0700 local time.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin reported that 12 drones heading towards the capital were shot down.

He added that emergency services crews were deployed to assess damage caused by falling drone debris.

In the Tula region, just south of Moscow, drone wreckage crashed in the courtyard of a residential building, smashing windows in a number of apartments, local governor Dmitriy Milyaev said.

No-one was injured, he added.

The attacks came as Russia and Ukraine take part in prisoner swaps agreed after talks between the two sides in Turkey.

On Friday, Ukraine and Russia each handed over 390 soldiers and civilians in the biggest prisoner exchange since Russia launched its full-scale assault in February 2022.

On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that another 307 Ukrainian prisoners had returned home as part of an exchange deal with the Kremlin.

The two countries have agreed to swap a total of 1,000 prisoners each, and another exchange is expected on Sunday.

The swap follows the first face-to-face talks between the two sides in three years, which took place in Turkey.

Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump and Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss a US-proposed Ukraine ceasefire deal.

Trump said he believed the call had gone "very well", and added that Russia and Ukraine will "immediately start" negotiations toward a ceasefire and "an end to the war".

However, Putin has only said Russia would work with Ukraine to craft a "memorandum" on a "possible future peace", and has not accepted a 30-day ceasefire.

Harvard foreign students face uncertainty as Trump plan to block enrolment is halted - for now

A judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration's plan to strip Harvard University of its ability to enrol foreign students. The ruling came after Harvard filed a lawsuit - the latest escalation of a dispute between the White House and one of America's most prestigious institutions. The university said the administration's decision on Thursday to bar international students was a "blatant violation" of the law and free speech rights. The Trump administration says Harvard has not done enough to fight antisemitism, and change its hiring and admissions practices – allegations that the university has strongly denied.

US District Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order in a short ruling issued on Friday. The order pauses a move that the Department of Homeland Security made on Thursday to revoke Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) - a government database that manages foreign students. The next hearing will occur on 29 May in Boston. "With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission," Harvard argued in the lawsuit. "We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action," Harvard President Alan Garber said in a letter. 'We did not sign up for this': Harvard's foreign students are stuck and scared "The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body," he wrote. In response, White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said: "If only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus they wouldn't be in this situation to begin with. After the restraining order was issued, Ms Jackson accused the judge in the case of having a "liberal agenda". "These unelected judges have no right to stop the Trump Administration from exercising their rightful control over immigration policy and national security policy," she said.

Graduation in the shadow of uncertainty

It was quiet at Harvard on Friday. Classes have finished for the year and preparations are being made for commencements. Gazebos were going up on the quad as students rented their gowns and collected tickets for family members. For those graduating, it should be a week of celebration. But for foreign students hoping to remain in the US, it's been a 24-hour whirlwind. All morning Harvard's international student body scrambled to find out what was going to happen. Would they have to leave the US immediately? Were they now under the threat of deportation? Cormac Savage from Downpatrick in Co Down Northern Ireland is six days from graduating with a degree in government and languages. He's taking a job in Brussels, partly because of the uncertainty in the US. "You know that you're fine if you're still legally in the United States for the next 90 days, but you don't know that you can come back and finish your degree," he said on Friday. "You don't know if you can stay and work in the US if you're about to graduate. The order also complicates plans for students still enroled, like Rohan Battula, a junior from the UK who will rely on his visa to work in New York in June. "I was worried if I went home I wouldn't get to come back," he told BBC, so he opted to stay on campus. For a group of international students gathered on the banks of the Charles River, as rowing teams sculled by, the relief was palpable when news came in of the reprieve from the Boston court. Mr Battula also felt relieved after Judge Burroughs issued her order. But the uncertainty still is taking a toll. "It's surreal to think that even for some period of time you're unlawfully staying in a country, just because you've been to university there," Mr Battula said.

Student dreams left in limbo

There are around 6,800 international students at Harvard, who make up more than 27% of its enrolled students this year. Around a fifth of them are from China, with significant numbers from Canada, India, South Korea and the UK. Among the international students currently enrolled is the future queen of Belgium, 23-year-old Princess Elisabeth. Leo Ackerman was set to study education and entrepreneurship at Harvard beginning in August, fulfilling a "dream". "I was really excited, and I'm still really excited if I manage to go there," Mr Ackerman said. "Having it taken away feels like a really sad moment for a lot of people." Eliminating foreign students would take a large bite out of Harvard's finances. Experts say international students are more likely to pay full tuition, essentially subsidising aid for American students. Undergraduate tuition - not including fees, housing, books, food or health insurance - will reach $59,320 (£43,850) in the coming academic year, according to the university. The total cost of a year at Harvard before any financial aid is usually significantly more than $100,000. Isaac Bangura, a public administration student from Sierra Leone, moved to Harvard with his wife and two young daughters after surviving a civil war. "Since yesterday, my kids has been asking, 'Daddy, I understand they are coming to return us home again.' They are referring to deportation," he said. He said he has to be strong for them and has faith. "I know the American people are always, whenever they are into issues, they will find ways of resolving it," he said.

The government vs. an ultra-elite university

In addition to Harvard, the Trump administration has taken aim at other elite institutions, not only arguing that they should do more to clamp down on pro-Palestinian activists but also claiming they discriminate against conservative viewpoints. On Friday, speaking from the Oval Office, President Donald Trump said, "Harvard is going to have to change its ways" and suggested he is considering measures against more universities. In April, the White House froze $2.2bn (£1.7bn) in federal funding to Harvard, and Trump has threatened to remove the university's tax-exempt status, a standard designation for US educational institutions. The funding freeze prompted an earlier Harvard lawsuit, also asking the courts to stop the administration's actions. Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, said federal courts in Massachusetts and New England, where the initial stages of the case will play out, have consistently ruled against the Trump administration. But the outcome may be less predictable in the US Supreme Court, where Harvard's case may end up. "These are tough issues for Harvard, but they have the resources and they seem to have the will to fight," Mr Tobias said. Harvard leaders have made concessions to the White House - including dismissing the leaders of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies, who came under fire for failing to represent Israeli perspectives. But it also enlisted several high-profile Republican lawyers, including Robert Hur, a former special counsel who investigated Joe Biden's retention of classified documents. Foreign students currently attending Harvard have expressed worries that the row could force them to transfer to another university or return home. Being logged on the SEVP system is a requirement for student visas and, if Harvard is blocked from the database, students could be found in violation and potentially face deportation. Several British students enrolled at Harvard, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity out of fear of immigration authorities, worried their US education could be cut short. "I definitely think freedom of speech is a problem on campus, but it's being actively worked on... it was an absolute shock when yesterday's announcement happened," said one student "There's a lot of anger, people feeling like we're being used as pawns in a game."

Murdered on the school run: The controversial Ukrainian gunned down in Madrid

Andriy Portnov's murder in a Madrid suburb may have been shocking, but it has not exactly triggered an outpouring of grief in Ukraine. The controversial former official had just dropped his children off at the American School when he was shot several times in the car park. The image of his lifeless body lying face down in a gym kit marked the end of a life synonymous with Ukrainian corruption and Russian influence. Ukraine's media have been discussing the 51-year-old's frequent threats to journalists, as well as his huge influence under the country's last pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. "A man who called for the killing of political opponents suddenly got what he wanted from others," observed reporter Oleksandr Holubov. News website Ukrayinska Pravda even called him "the devil's advocate". Rare words of restraint came from Portnov's once political rival Serhiy Vlasenko, an MP, who said: "You can't kill people. When discussing someone's death, we must remain human." Portnov was controversial and widely disliked. The motives for his murder may seem evident, but his death has still left unanswered questions.

'A kingpin'

Before entering Ukrainian politics, Portnov ran a law firm. He worked with then-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko until 2010, before defecting to Yanukovych's camp when he won the election. "It was a big story of betrayal," remembers Ukrainian journalist Kristina Berdynskykh. "Because Tymoshenko was a pro-Western politician, and Yanukovych pro-Russian."

EPA Portnov had worked closely with then-Prime Minister Tymoshenko

The adviser became the country's first deputy head of the Presidential Office and set up a national criminal code in 2012. For him, his critics say, his ascent was less about politics, and more about power and influence. "He was just a good lawyer, everyone knew he was very smart," Kristina tells me. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Ukraine inherited a judicial system in desperate need of reform. Mykhailo Zhernakov, a legal expert and head of the Dejure Foundation believes Portnov remoulded it in order for the government to cover up illegal schemes, and to mask Russian attempts to control the country. "He was the kingpin, mastermind and architect of this corrupt legal system designed to serve the pro-Russian administration at the time," he says.

'A rotten system'

Over a decade, Portnov would sue journalists who wrote negative stories about him through the courts and judges he controlled. His attempts to control the judicial system would lead to him being sanctioned by the US. At the time, Washington accused the adviser of placing loyal officials in senior positions for his own benefit, as well as "buying court decisions". Portnov later pursued activists who took part in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution, which toppled Viktor Yanukovych from power, and forced him to escape the country to Russia. "He used sexual threats," says Oksana Romaniuk who remembers her and other journalists' interactions with Portnov well. As director of the Institute of Mass Information, she monitors free speech in Ukraine. Whenever a damning report was published, the reaction was familiar and consistent. "When people exposed his corruption, he accused them of fake news," she says. "Even when journalists had documents and testimonies backing up the allegations, it was impossible to win the lawsuits in court. It was impossible to defend yourself. It was a rotten system."

Reuters Portnov (R) became an integral part of Viktor Yanukovych's presidential team

Andriy Portnov eventually settled in Moscow after his old boss Yanukovych fled in 2014. Investigative reporter Maksym Savchuk subsequently investigated his ties to Moscow, as well as his extensive property portfolio there. "He responded with words I don't want to quote, derogatory ones about my mother," he remembers. "It's a trait of his character; he is a very vindictive person." Even after leaving Ukraine, Portnov still tried to influence Ukrainian politics by taking control of pro-Kremlin TV channel NewsOne. He returned in 2019, only to flee again with the full-scale invasion in 2022. The irony of Portnov eventually settling in Spain and sending his children to a prestigious American school has not been lost on many.

Alongside the undisguised delight in Portnov's death, there has been endless speculation over who was responsible. "It could have been the Russians because he knew so many things," suggests legal expert Mykhailo Zhernakov. "He was involved in so many shady Russian operations it could be them or other criminal groups. He managed to annoy a lot of people," he says.

An Israeli air strike on Gaza hit the home of a doctor and killed nine of her 10 children, the hospital where she works in the city of Khan Younis says. Nasser hospital said one of Dr Alaa al-Najjar's children and her husband were injured, but survived. Graeme Groom, a British surgeon working in the hospital who operated on her surviving 11-year-old boy, told the BBC it was "unbearably cruel" that his mother, who spent years caring for children as a paediatrician, could lose almost all her own in a single missile strike. Israel's military said its aircraft had struck "a number of suspects" in Khan Younis on Friday, and "the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review".

A video shared by the director of the Hamas-run health ministry and verified by the BBC showed small burned bodies lifted from the rubble of a strike in Khan Younis. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its "aircraft struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis". "The Khan Younis area is a dangerous war zone. Before beginning operations there, the IDF evacuated civilians from this area for their own safety," the Israeli military said. In a general statement on Saturday, the IDF said it had struck more than 100 targets across Gaza over the past day. The health ministry said at least 74 people had been killed by the Israeli military over the 24 hour-period leading up to about midday on Saturday. Dr Muneer Alboursh, director of the health ministry, said on X that the al-Najjars' family house was hit minutes after Dr al-Najjar's husband Hamdi had returned home after driving his wife to work. Dr Alboursh said the eldest of Dr al-Najjar's children was aged 12.

Mr Groom said the children's father was "very badly injured", in a video posted on the Instagram account of another British surgeon working at Nasser hospital, Victoria Rose. He told the BBC that the father had a "penetrating injury to his head". He said he had asked about the father, also a doctor at the hospital, and had been told he had "no political and no military connections and doesn't seem to be prominent on social media". He described it as an "unimaginable" situation for Dr Alaa al-Najjar. Mr Groom said the surviving 11-year-old boy, Adam, was "quite small" for his age. "His left arm was just about hanging off, he was covered in fragment injuries and he had several substantial lacerations," he told the BBC. "Since both his parents are doctors, he seemed to be among the privileged group within Gaza, but as we lifted him onto the operating table, he felt much younger than 11." "Our little boy could survive, but we don't know about his father," he added.

Mahmoud Basal, spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, said on Telegram on Friday afternoon that his teams had recovered eight bodies and several injured from the al-Najjar house near a petrol station in Khan Younis. The hospital initially posted on Facebook that eight children had been killed, then two hours later updated that number to nine. Another doctor, Youssef Abu al-Rish, said in a statement posted by the health ministry that he had arrived to the operating room to find Dr al-Najjar waiting for information about her surviving son and tried to console her. In an interview recorded by AFP news agency, relative Youssef al-Najjar said: "Enough! Have mercy on us! We plead to all countries, the international community, the people, Hamas, and all factions to have mercy on us. "We are exhausted from the displacement and the hunger, enough!"

On Friday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that people in Gaza were enduring what may be "the cruellest phase" of the war, and denounced Israel's blockade on humanitarian aid imposed in March. Israel partially lifted the blockade earlier this week. Israeli military body Cogat said 83 more trucks carrying flour, food, medical equipment pharmaceutical drugs entered Gaza on Friday. The UN has repeatedly said the amount of aid entering is nowhere near enough for the territory's 2.1 million people - saying between 500 to 600 trucks a day are needed - and has called for Israel to allow in much more. The limited amount of food that trickled into Gaza this week sparked chaotic scenes, with armed looters attacking an aid convoy and Palestinians crowding outside bakeries in a desperate attempt to obtain bread. A UN-backed assessment this month said Gaza's population was at "critical risk" of famine. People in Gaza have told the BBC they have no food, and malnourished mothers are unable to breastfeed babies.

India's colonial past revealed through 200 masterful paintings

DAG Patna's Sewak Ram painted this watercolour of prayers at a Muharram festival, 1820

Founded in 1600 as a trading enterprise, the English East India company gradually transformed into a colonial power. By the late 18th Century, as it tightened its grip on India, company officials began commissioning Indian artists - many formerly employed by the Mughals - to create striking visual records of the land they were now ruling. A Treasury of Life: Indian Company Paintings, c. 1790 to 1835, an ongoing show in the Indian capital put together by Delhi Art Gallery (DAG), features over 200 works that once lay on the margins of mainstream art history. It is India's largest exhibition of company paintings, highlighting their rich diversity and the skill of Indian artists. Painted by largely unnamed artists, these paintings covered a wide range of subjects, but mainly fall into three categories: natural history, like botanical studies; architecture, including monuments and scenic views of towns and landscapes; and Indian manners and customs. "The focus on these three subject areas reflects European engagements with their Indian environment in an attempt to come to terms with all that was unfamiliar to Western eyes," says Giles Tillotson of DAG, who curated the show. "Europeans living in India were delighted to encounter flora and fauna that were new to them, and ancient buildings in exotic styles. They met – or at least observed – multitudes of people whose dress and habits were strange but – as they began to discern – were linked to stream of religious belief and social practice."

DAG Sita Ram painted the dargah of Sheikh Salim Chishti, Fatehpur Sikri, 1815-25

Beyond natural history, India's architectural heritage captivated European visitors. Before photography, paintings were the best way to document travels, and iconic Mughal monuments became prime subjects. Patrons soon turned to skilled local artists. Beyond the Taj Mahal, popular subjects included Agra Fort, Jama Masjid, Buland Darwaza, Sheikh Salim Chishti's tomb at Fatehpur Sikri (above), and Delhi's Qutub Minar and Humayun's Tomb. The once-obscure and long-anonymous Indian artist Sita Ram, who painted the tomb, was one of them. From June 1814 to early October 1815, Sita Ram travelled extensively with Francis Rawdon, also known as the Marquess of Hastings, who had been appointed as the governor general in India in 1813 and held the position for a decade. (He is not to be confused with Warren Hastings, who served as India's first governor general much earlier.)

DAG The largest group in this collection is a set of botanical watercolours, likely from Murshidabad in West Bengal

The largest group in this collection is a set of botanical watercolours, likely from Murshidabad or Maidapur (in present-day West Bengal). While Murshidabad was the Nawab of Bengal's capital, the East India Company operated there. In the late 18th century, nearby Maidapur briefly served as a British base before Calcutta's (now Kolkata) rise eclipsed it. Originally part of the Louisa Parlby Album - named after the British woman who compiled it while her husband, Colonel James Parlby, served in Bengal - the works likely date to the late 18th Century, before Louisa's return to Britain in 1801. "The plants represented in the paintings are likely quite illustrative of what could be found growing in both the well-appointed gardens as well as the more marginal spaces of common greens, waysides and fields in the Murshidabad area during the late eighteenth century," writes Nicolas Roth of Harvard University. "These are familiar plants, domestic and domesticated, which helped constitute local life worlds and systems of meaning, even as European patrons may have seen them mainly as exotica to be collected."

Another painting from the collection is of a temple procession showing a Shiva statue on an ornate platform carried by men, flanked by Brahmins and trumpeters. At the front, dancers with sticks perform under a temporary gateway, while holy water is poured on them from above. Labeled Ouricaty Tirounal, it depicts a ritual from Thirunallar temple in Karaikal in southern India, capturing a rare moment from a 200-year-old tradition.

By the late 18th Century, company paintings had become true collaborations between European patrons and Indian artists. Art historian Mildred Archer called them a "fascinating record of Indian social life," blending the fine detail of Mughal miniatures with European realism and perspective. Regional styles added richness - Tanjore artists, for example, depicted people of various castes, shown with tools of their trade. These albums captured a range of professions - nautch girls, judges, sepoys, toddy tappers, and snake charmers. "They catered to British curiosity while satisfying European audience's fascination with the 'exoticism' of Indian life," says Kanupriya Sharma of DAG.

DAG Ten men in hats and loincloths rowing through surf, 1800

Most studies of company painting focus on British patronage, but in south India, the French were commissioning Indian artists as early as 1727. A striking example is a set of 48 paintings from Pondicherry - uniform in size and style - showing the kind of work French collectors sought by 1800. One painting (above) shows 10 men in hats and loincloths rowing through surf. A French caption calls them nageurs (swimmers) and the boat a chilingue. Among the standout images are two vivid scenes by an artist known as B, depicting boatmen navigating the rough Coromandel coast in stitched-plank rowboats. With no safe harbours near Madras or Pondicherry, these skilled oarsmen were vital to European trade, ferrying goods and people through dangerous surf between anchored ships and the shore.

Shreya Mishra Reddy Harvard is "the ultimate school that anybody in India wants to get into," says Shreya Mishra Reddy

When Shreya Mishra Reddy was admitted to Harvard University in 2023, her parents were "ecstatic". It is "the ultimate school that anybody in India wants to get into," she tells the BBC. Now, with graduation around the corner, she has had to break the bad news to her family: she may not graduate in July from the executive leadership programme after the Trump administration moved to stop Harvard from enrolling international students "as a result of their failure to adhere to the law". "It has been very difficult for my family to hear. They're still trying to process it," she said. Ms Reddy is one of around 6,800 international students at Harvard, who make up more than 27% of its enrolments this year. They are a crucial source of revenue for the Ivy League school. About a third of its foreign students are from China, and more than 700 are Indian, such as Ms Reddy. All of them are now unsure of what to expect next. Harvard has called the move "unlawful", which could lead to a legal challenge. But that leaves the students' futures in limbo, be it those who are waiting to enrol this summer, or are halfway through college, or even those awaiting graduation whose work opportunities are tied to their student visas. Those who are already at Harvard would have to transfer to other American universities to remain in the US and retain their visas. "I hope Harvard will stand for us and some solution can be worked out," Ms Reddy says. The university has said it is "fully committed to maintaining [its] ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University – and this nation – immeasurably".

The move against Harvard has huge implications for the million or so international students in the US. And it follows a growing crackdown by the Trump administration on institutes of higher learning, especially those that witnessed major pro-Palestinian protests on campus. Dozens of them are facing investigations, as the government attempts to overhaul their accreditation process and reshape the way they are run. The White House first threatened to bar foreign students from Harvard in April, after the university refused to make changes to its hiring, admissions and teaching practices. And it also froze nearly $3bn in federal grants, which Harvard is challenging in court. Still, Thursday's announcement - which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said came because they were allegedly "fostering violence" and "antisemitism" - left students reeling. Chinese student Kat Xie, who is in her second year in a STEM programme, says she is "in shock". "I had almost forgotten about [the earlier threat of a ban] and then Thursday's announcement suddenly came." But she adds a part of her had expected "the worst", so she had spent the last few weeks seeking professional advice on how to continue staying in the US. But the options are "all very troublesome and expensive", she says.

Harvard has been given 72 hours to comply with a list of demands to have an "opportunity" to regain its ability to enrol these students, including providing the government with all disciplinary records for non-immigrant students enrolled at Harvard over the past five years. Noem also demanded Harvard turn over electronic records, videos, or audio of "illegal" and "dangerous or violent" activity by non-immigrant students on campus. But the Trump administration also appeared to single China out when Noem also accused Harvard of "coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party" in her statement. Beijing responded on Friday by criticising the "politicisation" of education. It said the move would "only harm the image and international standing of the United States", urging for the ban to be withdrawn "as soon as possible". "None of this is what we've signed up for," says 20-year-old Abdullah Shahid Sial from Pakistan, a very vocal student activist. A junior majoring in applied mathematics and economics, he was one of only two Pakistani undergraduate students admitted to Harvard in 2023. He was also the first person in his family to study abroad. It was a "massive" moment for them, he says. The situation he now finds himself in, he adds, is "ridiculous and dehumanising".

Abdullah Shahid Sial Abdullah Shahid Sial from Pakistan says getting into Harvard was a huge achievement for him

Both Ms Reddy and Mr Sial said foreign students apply to go to college in the US because they see it as a welcoming place where opportunities abound. "You have so much to learn from different cultures, from people of different backgrounds. And everybody really valued that," Ms Reddy says, adding that this had been her experience at Harvard so far. But Mr Sial says that has changed more recently and foreign students no longer feel welcome - the Trump administration has revoked hundreds of student visas and even detained students on campuses across the country. Many of them were linked to pro-Palestinian protests. Now, Mr Sial adds, there is a lot of fear and uncertainty in the international student community. That has only been exacerbated by the latest development. A postgraduate student from South Korea says she is having second thoughts about going home for the summer because she fears she won't be able to re-enter the US. She did not want to reveal her name because she is worried that might affect her chances of staying in the US. She is one year away from graduating. She said she had a gruelling semester and had been looking forward to "reuniting with friends and family" - until now.

BBC Korean Han Tae-soon had spent decades looking for her daughter Kyung-ha

The last memory Han Tae-soon has of her daughter as a child is in May 1975, at their home in Seoul. "I was going to the market and asked Kyung-ha, 'Aren't you coming?' But she told me, 'No, I'm going to play with my friends'," recalled Ms Han. "When I came back, she was gone." Ms Han would not see her daughter again for more than four decades. When they reunited, Kyung-ha was almost unrecognisable as a middle-aged American woman named Laurie Bender. Kyung-ha had been kidnapped near her home, brought to an orphanage, then sent illegally to the US to be raised by another family, alleges Ms Han, who is now suing the South Korean government for failing to prevent her daughter's adoption. She is among the hundreds of people who have come forward in recent years with damning allegations of fraud, illegal adoptions, kidnapping and human trafficking in South Korea's controversial overseas adoption programme. No other country has sent as many children abroad for adoption, and for so long, as South Korea. Since the programme began in the 1950s, about 170,000 to 200,000 children have been adopted overseas - most of them in the West. In March, a landmark inquiry found that successive governments had committed human rights violations with their lack of oversight, allowing private agencies to "mass export" children for profit on an industrial scale. Experts say the findings could open the door to more lawsuits against the government. Ms Han's is set to go to court next month. It is one of two landmark cases. Ms Han is the first biological parent of an overseas adoptee seeking damages from the government, while in 2019, a man who was adopted in the US was the first adoptee to sue. A government spokesman told the BBC that it "deeply sympathises with the emotional pain of individuals and families who could not find each other for a long time". It added that it considered Ms Han's case with "deep regret" and that it would take "necessary actions" based on the outcome of the trial. Ms Han, 71, told the BBC she is determined the government takes responsibility. "I spent 44 years ruining my body and mind searching for [my daughter]. But in all that time, has anyone ever apologised to me? No one. Not once." For decades, she and her husband visited police stations and orphanages, put up flyers, and went on television appealing for information. Ms Han said she spent all day pounding the streets looking for her daughter "till all 10 of my toenails fell out". Over the years she thought she came close. In 1990, after one of her TV appeals, Ms Han met a woman who she believed could be Kyung-ha, and even took her in to live with her family for a while. But the woman eventually confessed she was not her daughter. A breakthrough finally happened in 2019 when Ms Han signed up with 325 Kamra, a group that connects overseas Korean adoptees with their birth parents by matching their DNA. They soon reported a match - Laurie Bender, a nurse in California. After several phone calls, she flew over to Seoul to meet Ms Han, where the two had a tearful reunion at the airport.

As they embraced, Ms Han ran her fingers through Kyung-ha's hair. "I've been a hairdresser for 30 years. I can quickly tell if it's my daughter just by feeling her hair. I had mistakenly thought I found her before, so I had to touch and feel the hair to confirm it," she said. The first thing she told her daughter was "I'm so sorry". "I felt guilty because she couldn't find her way home when she was a child. I kept thinking about how much she must have searched for her mother… Meeting her after all those years made me realise how much she must have longed for her mother, and it broke my heart." "It's like a hole in your heart has been healed, you finally feel like a complete person," Kyung-ha said about their reunion in an earlier interview with the Associated Press. She did not respond to the BBC's requests for an interview. The pair eventually pieced together what happened on that day in May 1975. Kyung-ha, who was six years old at the time, was playing near her home when she was approached by a strange woman claiming to know her mother. Kyung-ha was told her mother "didn't need" her any more and was taken to a train station. After taking a train ride with the woman, Kyung-ha was abandoned at the final stop, where she was eventually picked up by police officers and placed in an orphanage. Soon, she was flown to the US to be adopted by a couple in Virginia. Years later, checks revealed she was given false papers stating she was an abandoned orphan whose parents were unknown. "It's like you've been living a fake life and everything you know is not true," Kyung-ha said previously. Her case was far from an isolated one.

A 'trade in children' from Asia to the West

South Korea's overseas adoption programme began in the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War, when it was a deeply impoverished country with an estimated 100,000 orphaned and displaced children. At that time, few families were willing to adopt non-biological children, and the government began an overseas adoption programme, billed as a humanitarian effort. The programme was handled entirely by private adoption agencies. While they were under government oversight, over time these agencies gained significant autonomy through laws. As their power grew, so did the number of children being sent abroad, rising in the 1970s and peaking in the 1980s. In 1985 alone, more than 8,800 children were sent overseas. There was a massive demand from the West - with declining birth rates and fewer babies to adopt at home, families began seeking children elsewhere.

Photos from that era show planes heading to Western countries filled with Korean children, with swaddled babies strapped to seats – what the truth and reconciliation commission's inquiry called the "mass transportation of children like cargo". The report alleges little care was taken of these children during these long flights. In one case it cited from 1974, a lactose-intolerant child was fed milk in transit and subsequently died upon arrival in Denmark. Critics of the programme have long questioned why so many children needed to be sent overseas at a time when South Korea was already experiencing rapid economic growth. A 1976 BBC Panorama documentary, which featured South Korea as one of several Asian countries sending children to the West, quoted an observer describing the situation as "out of control" and "almost like a trade in children… flowing from Asia into Europe and North America". According to the truth and reconciliation report, foreign adoption agencies set quotas for children, which Korean agencies willingly fulfilled. It was a profitable business - the lack of government regulation allowed the Korean agencies to charge large amounts and demand hidden fees termed as "donations".

Truth and Reconciliation Commission The commission's report included this photo of babies strapped into plane seats obtained from a Danish adoption centre's 1984 annual report

Some of these children may have been obtained by unscrupulous means, with parents like Ms Han alleging their children were kidnapped. In the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of homeless or unattended children were rounded up and put in orphanages or welfare centres as part of a national campaign to "clean up the streets" of South Korea. Other parents were told their babies had fallen sick and died, when they were actually alive and taken to adoption agencies. Agencies also did not obtain proper consent from birth mothers to take their children for adoption, according to the truth and reconciliation report. The report also stated that adoption agencies deliberately falsified information in adoption records to cut corners and quickly meet the demand for children. Lost children who were found without any identity documents would be made to appear, in paperwork, as if they had been abandoned and put up for adoption. If a child intended for adoption had died or was reclaimed by their birth parents, another child would be swapped in and assigned the original child's identity. This allowed agencies to avoid refunding adoption fees and expedite the adoption process. Decades on, this has created immense difficulties for many overseas adoptees trying to track down their biological parents. Some have wrong or missing information in their adoption records, while others have discovered they were given entirely false identities. "We are victims of state violence but there is no trace of this - literally. This lack of documents must not make us victims for the second time," said Han Boon-young, co-founder of an overseas adoptee rights group campaigning for greater access to birth information. "This is a human rights issue. There were kidnappings, falsified documents - all of which were examples of violations committed during the inter-country adoption process. "It is really necessary to move towards reconciliation, that we recognise these experiences, and that the people who committed these violations be held responsible." But some of the key players continue to stay silent or deny wrongdoing. The BBC contacted Bu Chung-ha, who in the 1970s served as chairman of Holt International, South Korea's largest adoption agency. Holt is at the centre of numerous allegations of fraud and illegal adoptions, and the subject of two lawsuits so far, including Ms Han's. In a brief reply, Mr Bu denied that the agency had sent abroad any children wrongly identified as orphans during his tenure. Any parents alleging their children were kidnapped "did not lose their children, they abandoned them", he said. The current management of Holt International has yet to respond to the BBC's request for comment.

'The government was the captain, the agencies rowed the boat'

Experts say the responsibility lay not only with the private agencies but also with the state. "Adoption agencies exploited the system, and the government turned a blind eye - allowing illegal practices to take root," said Dr Lee Kyung-eun, an international law scholar at Seoul National University. "The government was the captain, and the agencies rowed the boat," said Shin Pil-sik, a researcher on transnational adoption at Seokyeong University, who added that this structure enabled both sides to deflect accountability. Dr Shin said the state was not a passive observer- it actively shaped adoption policy, setting annual quotas for overseas placements and even on occasion halted some adoptions. An Associated Press news investigation last year found successive Korean governments had rewritten laws to remove minimal safeguards and judicial oversight, fit their laws to match American ones to make children adoptable, and allowed foreign families to adopt Korean children quickly without ever visiting the country. While the government billed the programme as a humanitarian effort, observers say it also served to strengthen ties with Western countries. A 1984 government document obtained by the BBC stated that the official goals of the adoption policy included not only the welfare of children but also "the promotion of future national strength and people-to-people diplomacy". When asked about the state's role in past adoption practices, South Korea's health and welfare ministry said they were "continuing efforts to strengthen state responsibility" in the system and that it plans to promote adoptions that comply with international standards. In 2012, the government revised adoption laws to tighten screening of potential adoptive parents, and to track birthparent data and birth information better. It has also enacted reforms to the adoption system ensuring that overseas adoptions are minimised and that all adoptions would be handled by the government instead of private agencies. The changes will take effect in July. Meanwhile, overseas adoptions have declined. In the late 1980s, overseas adoptions dropped sharply, before stabilising in the 1990s and dropping again in the 2010s. Only 79 children were adopted abroad in 2023, according to the latest available data. But as South Korea begins to address this dark chapter in its past, adoptees and birth parents like Ms Han continue to struggle with their trauma.

Remembering the Indian scientist who challenged the Big Bang theory

BBC/Sharad Shankar Badhe Narlikar was a prolific scholar who published over 300 research papers

In his 1983 science fiction story, an Indian astrophysicist predicted what schools would look like in 2050. Jayant Narlikar envisioned a scene where an alien, living among humans, would sit in front of a screen and attend online classes. The aliens are yet to manifest, but online classes became a reality for students far sooner, in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Narlikar also famously proposed an alternative to the Big Bang Theory - the popular idea that the universe was created in a single moment from a single point. He believed that the universe had always existed, expanding continuously into infinity. With his passing on Tuesday, India lost one of its most celebrated astrophysicists. Narlikar was 86 - a man far ahead of his times and someone who shaped a generation of Indian researchers through his lifelong dedication to science education. His funeral was attended by hundreds, from school children to renowned scientists and even his housekeeping staff, underscoring the profound impact he had on society.

Getty Images Narlikar famously proposed an alternative to the Big Bang theory

Born on 19 July, 1938, in the town of Kolhapur in the western state of Maharashtra, Narlikar was raised in a home steeped in academic tradition. His father, Vishnu Narlikar, was a professor and mathematician, and mother Sumati was a scholar of the Sanskrit language. Following in his parents footsteps, the studious Narlikar went to Cambridge University for higher studies where topped a highly prestigious mathematical course. He also took a deep interest in astrophysics and cosmology. But his most significant episode at Cambridge was his association with his PhD guide, physicist Sir Fred Hoyle. Together, Narlikar and Hoyle laid the groundwork for a revolutionary alternative to the popular Big Bang theory. The two physicists contested the Big Bang Theory, which posits that all matter and energy in the universe came into existence in one single instance about 13.8 billion years ago. The Hoyle-Narlikar theory boldly proposed the continuous creation of new matter in an infinite universe. Their theory was based on what they called a quasi-steady state model. In his autobiography, My Tale of Four Cities, Narlikar used a banking analogy to explain the theory. "To understand this concept better, think of capital invested in a bank which offers a fixed rate of compound interest. That is, the interest accrued is constantly added to the capital which therefore grows too, along with the interest." He explained that the universe expanded like the capital with compound interest. However, as the name 'steady state' implies, the universe always looks the same to the observer. Astronomer Somak Raychaudhury says that though Narlikar's theory isn't as popular as the Big Bang, it is still useful. "He advanced mechanisms by which matter could be continually created and destroyed in an infinite universe," Raychaudhary said. "While the Big Bang model gained broader acceptance, many tools developed for the steady-state model remain useful today," he added Raychaudhary recollects that even after Hoyle began to entertain elements of the Big Bang theory, Narlikar remained committed to the steady-state theory. A sign outside his office fittingly stated: "The Big Bang is an exploding myth."

BBC Father Moses McPherson's congregation has tripled in size in 18 months, and he has a big following online

"A lot of people ask me: 'Father Moses, how can I increase my manliness to absurd levels?'" In a YouTube video, a priest is championing a form of virile, unapologetic masculinity. Skinny jeans, crossing your legs, using an iron, shaping your eyebrows, and even eating soup are among the things he derides as too feminine. There are other videos of Father Moses McPherson - a powerfully-built father of five - weightlifting to the sound of heavy metal. He was raised a Protestant and once worked as a roofer, but now serves as a priest in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) in Georgetown, Texas, an offshoot of the mother church in Moscow. ROCOR, a global network with headquarters in New York, has recently been expanding across parts of the US - mainly as a result of people converting from other faiths. In the last six months, Father Moses has prepared 75 new followers for baptism in his church of the Mother of God, just north of Austin. "When my wife and I converted 20 years ago we used to call Orthodoxy the best-kept secret, because people just didn't know what it was," he says. "But in the past year-and-a-half our congregation has tripled in size."

Software engineer Theodore tells me he had a dream job and a wife he adored, but he felt empty inside, as if there was a hole in his heart. He believes society has been "very harsh" on men and is constantly telling them they are in the wrong. He complains that men are criticised for wanting to be the breadwinner and support a stay-at-home wife. "We are told that's a very toxic relationship nowadays," Theodore says. "That's not how it should be." Almost all the converts I meet have opted to home-school their offspring, partly because they believe women should prioritise their families rather than their careers. Father John Whiteford, an archpriest in the ROCOR from Spring, north of Houston, says home-schooling ensures a religious education and is "a way of protecting your children", while avoiding any talk about "transgenderism, or the 57 genders of the month or whatever".

Compared to the millions of worshippers in America's evangelical megachurches, the numbers of Christian Orthodox are tiny - only about one percent of the population. That includes Eastern Orthodoxy, as practised across Russia, Ukraine, eastern Europe and Greece, and the Oriental Orthodox from the Middle East and Africa. Founded by priests and clergy fleeing the Russian Revolution in 1917, ROCOR is seen by many as the most conservative Orthodox jurisdiction in the US. Yet this small religious community is a vocal one, and what's unfolding within it mirrors broader political shifts, especially following President Donald Trump's dramatic pivot toward Moscow. The true increase in the number of converts is hard to quantify, but data from the Pew Research Centre suggests Orthodox Christians are 64% male, up from 46% in 2007. A smaller study of 773 converts appears to back the trend. Most recent newcomers are men, and many say the pandemic pushed them to seek a new faith. That survey is from the Orthodox Church in America (OCA), which was established by Russian monks in Alaska in the late 18th Century and now has more than 700 parishes, missions, communities, monasteries, and institutions in the US, Canada and Mexico which identify as Russian Orthodox. Professor Scott Kenworthy, who studies the history and thought of Eastern Orthodox Christianity - particularly in modern Russia - says his OCA parish in Cincinnati "is absolutely bursting at the seams". He's attended the same church for 24 years and says congregation numbers remained steady until the Covid lockdown. Since then, there has been constant flow of new inquirers and people preparing to be baptised, known as catechumens. "This is not just a phenomenon of my own parish, or a few places in Texas," Prof Kenworthy says, "it is definitely something broader." The digital space is key in this wave of new converts. Father Moses has a big following online - when he shares a picture of a positive pregnancy test on his Instagram feed he gets 6,000 likes for announcing the arrival of his sixth child. But there are dozens of other podcasts and videos presented by Orthodox clergy and an army of followers - mainly male.

Father Moses tells his congregation there are two ways of serving God - being a monk or a nun, or getting married. Those who take the second path should avoid contraception and have as many children as possible. "Show me one saint in the history of the Church who ever blessed any kind of birth control," Father Moses says. As for masturbation - or what the church calls self-abuse - the priest condemns it as "pathetic and unmanly". Father Moses says Orthodoxy is "not masculine, it is just normal", while "in the West everything has become very feminised". Some Protestant churches, he believes, mainly cater for women. "I don't want to go to services that feel like a Taylor Swift concert," Father Moses says." If you look at the language of the 'worship music', it's all emotion - that's not men." Elissa Bjeletich Davis, a former Protestant who now belongs to the Greek Orthodox Church in Austin, is a Sunday school teacher and has her own podcast. She says many converts belong to "the anti-woke crowd" and sometimes have strange ideas about their new faith - especially those in the Russian Church. "They see it as a military, rigid, disciplinary, masculine, authoritarian religion," Elissa says. "It's kind of funny. It's almost as if the old American Puritans and their craziness is resurfacing."

Buck Johnson Former atheist Buck began exploring Russian Orthodoxy during the Covid pandemic

Buck Johnson has worked as a firefighter for 25 years and hosts the Counterflow podcast. He says he was initially scared to enter his local Russian Orthodox Church as he "looks different, covered in tattoos", but tells me he was welcomed with open arms. He was also impressed the church stayed open throughout the Covid lockdown. Sitting on a couch in front of two huge TV screens at his home in Lockhart, he says his newfound faith is changing his view of the world. "Negative American views on Russia are what worry me," Buck says. He tells me the mainstream, "legacy" media presents a distorted picture of the invasion of Ukraine. "I think there's a holdover from the boomer generation here in America that lived through the Cold War," Buck says, "and I don't quite grasp why - but they say Russia's bad." The head of the Russian Church in Moscow, Patriarch Kirill, has doggedly backed the invasion of Ukraine, calling it a Holy War, and expressing little compassion for its victims. When I ask Archpriest Father John Whiteford about Russia's top cleric, who many see as a warmonger, he assures me the Patriarch's words have been distorted. Footage and photographs of Putin quoting Bible verses, holding candles during services in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and stripping down to his swim trunks to plunge into icy water at Epiphany, seem to have struck a chord. Some - in America and other countries - see Russia as the last bastion of true Christianity.

Victims in landmark child abuse trial ask why France doesn't want to know

Getty Images Protesters outside the court in Vannes have turned out to show their support for Le Scouarnec's victims

It was supposed to be a defining, catalytic moment for French society. Horrific, but unmissable. Unignorable. The seaside town of Vannes, in southern Brittany, had carefully prepared a special venue and a separate overflow amphitheatre for the occasion. Hundreds of journalists were accredited for a process that would, surely, dominate headlines in France throughout its three-month duration and force a queasy public to confront a crime too often shunted to the sidelines. Warning: Some of the details of this story are disturbing Comparisons were quickly made with - and expectations tied to - last year's Pelicot mass rape trial in southern France and the massive global attention it garnered. Instead, the trial of France's most prolific known paedophile, Joel Le Scouarnec - a retired surgeon who has admitted in court to raping or sexually assaulting 299 people, almost all of them children - is coming to an end this Wednesday amid widespread frustration. "I'm exhausted. I'm angry. Right now, I don't have much hope. Society seems totally indifferent. It's frightening to think [the rapes] could happen again," one of Le Scouarnec's victims, Manon Lemoine, 36, told the BBC.

Benoit PEYRUCQ/AFP Retired surgeon Le Scouarnec has admitted almost 300 allegations of rape and abuse

Ms Lemoine and some 50 other victims, stung by an apparent lack of public interest in the trial, have formed their own campaign group to pressure the French authorities, accusing the government of ignoring a "landmark" case which exposed a "true laboratory of institutional failures". The group has questioned why a parliamentary commission has not been set up, as in other high-profile abuse cases, and spoken of being made to feel "invisible", as if "the sheer number of victims prevented us from being recognised." Some of the victims, most of whom had initially chosen to testify anonymously, have now decided to reveal their identities in public – even posing for photos on the courthouse steps – in the hope of jolting France into paying more attention and, perhaps, learning lessons about a culture of deference that helped a prestigious surgeon to rape with impunity for decades. The crimes for which Le Scouarnec is on trial all occurred between 1998 and 2014. "It's not normal that I should have to show my face. [But] I hope that what we're doing now will change things. That's why we decided to rise up, to make our voices heard," said Ms Lemoine. So, what has gone wrong? Were the horrors too extreme, the subject matter too unremittingly grim or simply too uncomfortable to contemplate? Why, when the whole world knows the name of Dominique and Gisèle Pelicot, has a trial with significantly more victims - child victims abused under the noses of the French medical establishment - passed by with what feels like little more than a collective shudder?

MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP Gisèle Pelicot (C) became a single recognisable figure in her ex-husband's trial

Why does the world not know the name Joel Le Scouarnec? "The Le Scouarnec case is not mobilising a lot of people. Perhaps because of the number of victims. We hear the disappointment, the lack of wide mobilisation, which is a pity," said Maëlle Nori, from feminist NGO Nous Toutes (All of Us).

Some observers have reflected on the absence in this case of a single, totemic figure like Gisèle Pelicot, whose public courage caught the public imagination and enabled people to find some light in an otherwise bleak story. Others have reached more devastating conclusions. "The issue is that this trial is about sexual abuse of children. There's a virtual omertà on this topic globally, but particularly in France. "We simply don't want to acknowledge it," Myriam Guedj-Benayoun, a lawyer representing several of Le Scouarnec's victims, told me. In her closing arguments to the court, Ms Guedj-Benayoun condemned what she called France's "systemic, organised silence" regarding child abuse. She spoke of a patriarchal society in which men in respected positions like medicine remained almost beyond reproach and pointed to "the silence of those who knew, those who looked the other way, and those who could have – should have – raised the alarm".

The depravity exposed during the trial has been astonishing – too much for many to stomach. The court in Vannes has heard in excruciating detail how Le Scouarnec, 74, wallowed in his paedophilia, carefully detailing each child rape in a succession of black notebooks, often preying on his vulnerable young patients while they were under anaesthetic or recovering from surgery. The court has also been told of the retired surgeon's growing isolation, and of what his own lawyer described as "your descent into hell", in the final decade before he was caught, in 2017, after abusing a neighbour's six-year-old daughter. By the end, alone in a filthy house, drinking heavily and ostracised by many of his relatives, Le Scouarnec was spending much of his time watching violent images of child rape online, and obsessing over a collection of lifelike child-sized dolls. "I was emotionally attached to them... They did what I wanted," Le Scouarnec told the court in his quiet monotone.

DAMIEN MEYER/AFP Joel Le Scouarnec (leaving the car) will undoubtedly face the rest of his life in jail

A few blocks from the courthouse, in an adapted civic hall, journalists have watched the proceedings unfold on a television screen. In recent days, the seats have begun to fill up and coverage of the trial has increased as it moves towards a close. Many commentators have noted how the Le Scouarnec trial, like the Pelicot case, has exposed the deep institutional failings which enabled the surgeon to continue his rapes long after they could have been detected and stopped. Dominique Pelicot had been caught "upskirting" in a supermarket in 2010 and his DNA quickly linked to an attempted rape in 1999 – a fact that, astonishingly, wasn't followed up for a whole decade. At Le Scouarnec's trial a succession of medical officials have explained – some ashamedly, others self-servingly – how an overstretched rural healthcare system chose, for years, to ignore the fact that the surgeon had been reported by America's FBI in 2004 after using a credit card to pay to download videos of child rapes on his computer. "I was advised not to talk about such and such a person," said one doctor who'd tried to sound the alarm. "There is a shortage of surgeons, and those who show up are welcomed like the messiah," explained a hospital director. "I messed up, I admit it, like the whole hierarchy," a different administrator finally conceded.

Another connection between the Pelicot and Le Scouarnec cases is what they've both revealed about our understanding – or lack of understanding – of trauma. Without warning or support, Gisèle Pelicot had been abruptly confronted by police with the video evidence of her own drugging and rapes. Later, during the trial, some defence lawyers and other commentators sought to minimise her suffering by pointing to the fact that she'd been unconscious during the rapes – as if trauma only exists, like a wound, when its scar is visible to the naked eye. In the Le Scouarnec case, French police appear to have gone about searching for the paedophile's many victims in a similarly brusque manner, summoning people for an unexplained interview and then informing them, out of the blue, that they'd been listed in the surgeon's notebooks. The reactions of Le Scouarnec's many victims have varied widely. Some have simply chosen not to engage with the trial, or with a childhood experience of which they have no memory. For others, news of the abuse has affected them profoundly. "You've entered my head, it's destroying me. I've become a different person – one I don't recognise," said a victim, addressing Le Scouarnec in court. "I have no memories and I'm already damaged," said another. "It turned me upside down," a policeman admitted.

And then there is a different group of people who – not unlike Gisèle Pelicot – have found that knowledge of their abuse has been revelatory, enabling them to make sense of things they had not previously understood about themselves or their lives. Some have connected their childhood abuse to a general sense of unhappiness, or poor behaviour, or failure in life. For others, the links have been much more specific, helping to explain a litany of mysterious symptoms and behaviours, from a fear of intimacy to repeated genital infections and eating disorders. "With my boyfriend, every time we have sex, I vomit," one woman revealed in court.

Labubu fan fury after dolls pulled from stores

BBC

Fans of viral Labubu dolls have reacted angrily online after its maker pulled the toys from all UK stores following reports of customers fighting over them. Pop Mart, which makes the monster bag charms, told the BBC it had paused selling them in all 16 of its shops until June to "prevent any potential safety issues". Labubu fan Victoria Calvert said she witnessed chaos in the Stratford store in London. "It was just getting ridiculous to be in that situation where people were fighting and shouting and you felt scared." The soft toys became a TikTok trend after being worn by celebrities like Rihanna and Dua Lipa. Now some retail experts are warning the stop on stock will only heighten demand.

Labubu is a quirky monster character created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, and popularised through a collaboration with toy store Pop Mart. Since gaining celebrity status they've gone viral as a fashion accessory. In the UK, prices can range from £13.50 to £50, with rare editions going for hundreds of pounds on resale sites such as Vinted and eBay. Pop Mart said it was working on a fairer system for when the toys return to its shelves. But fans on social media were not happy at the decision to pull the dolls. "It's your fault for drip feeding stock to us that's caused this hype," one commented on Pop Mart's Instagram post. Others vented their anger at resellers. "Buyers are re-selling them for £100 for one Labubu, which is unacceptable. How come they get to buy and other people can't?!" one said. "Sooo upset that resellers ruin everything," replied another.

Victoria Calvert Victoria Calvert went to buy a Labubu in the Stratford store but left after witnessing a fight

Victoria said when she arrived at the store she met other customers who had been outside since 03:00 BST and others that had camped overnight. "When I got there there were big crowds of people hovering around the shop and there was this really negative vibe," she said. "People were shouting, basically saying there were no more Labubus left. I even witnessed a fight between a worker and a customer." She said she left after feeling unsafe. "It was a pretty bad experience, it was really scary," she said. The store told the BBC: "Although no Pop Mart employees have been injured, we've chosen to act early and prevent any potential safety issues from occurring." Victoria said "it's probably for the best" that Pop Mart paused in-store sales. She believes some people at the front of the queue were resellers because "as soon as they got their ticket, apparently they were selling it for £150 and the ticket allowed you to get a Labubu."

Jaydee Jaydee says resellers spoil the fun of online trends, making things unaffordable for real fans

Jaydee, a marketing executive who posts Labubu unboxing videos on TikTok, blames resellers for ruining the fun of the Labubu trend. "I've lived in London my whole life and there is a resale crowd who do this," she told the BBC. "It's really unfortunate but for the real fans this is great news and the right decision," she said. "Now I can go into Pop Mart without having to queue."

Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Pop Mart's restricting stock and selling the dolls in blind boxes had led to the fan frenzy. "But the big crowds building on stock drop days have clearly become a costly headache to manage," she said. "Out-of-control crowds could affect ultimately the brand's playful and fun appeal which is likely to be why sales have been paused," she said. She warned the suspension would probably lead to demand building up and more attempts to buy the dolls online - but they sell out within seconds. "It could also push more fans to resale sites, but counterfeit Labubus are being sold, so there is a risk customers could be duped into buying fakes.'' Sarah Johnson, the founder of consultancy Flourish Retail, said suspending sales was "a strategic decision". Collectible brands like Labubu use scarcity as "a powerful tool", she added.

Iranian director speaks out after Cannes triumph

Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who has previously been put in prison and banned from film-making in his home country, spoke out against the restrictions of the regime after winning the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Panahi picked up the prestigious Palme d'Or for It Was Just an Accident, described by BBC Culture as "a furious but funny revenge thriller that takes aim at oppressive regimes". He was cheered as he urged fellow Iranians to "set aside" differences and problems. "What's most important now is our country and the freedom of our country," he said. "Let us join forces. No-one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do, or what we should not do."

Reuters Panahi received the award from Juliette Binoche and Cate Blanchett

Panahi's last spell in prison, from which he was freed in 2023, was for protesting against the detention of two fellow film-makers who had been critical of the authorities. His trip to Cannes was his first appearance at an international festival in 15 years, after being subject to a long travel ban. It Was Just an Accident was shot in secret and based partly on Panahi's own experiences in prison. "Before going to jail and before getting to know the people that I met there - and hearing their stories, their backgrounds - the issues I dealt with in my films were totally different," the director told the Hollywood Reporter. "It's really in this context (...) with this new commitment that I had felt in prison, that I had the idea, the inspiration for this story."

Jafar Pahani Productions/Les Films Pelleas It Was Just an Accident "slowly but surely builds into a stark condemnation of abusive power", The Hollywood Reporter said

The film tells the tale of five ordinary Iranians who are confronted with a man they believed tortured them in jail. The characters were inspired by conversations he had with other prisoners and "stories that they told me about, the violence and the brutality of the Iranian government", the director added. Panahi spent seven months of a six-year sentence in jail before being released in February 2023. He was previously sentenced to six years in 2010 for supporting anti-government protests and creating "propaganda against the system". He was released on conditional bail after two months, and was banned from making movies or travelling abroad.

He has vowed to return to Tehran after the festival despite the risks of prosecution. "As soon as I finish my work here I will go back to Iran," he told reporters in Cannes. "And I will ask myself what's my next film going to be."

The Guardian's review described It Was Just an Accident as Panahi's "most emotionally explicit film yet: a film about state violence and revenge, about the pain of tyranny that co-exists with ostensible everyday normality". "It's another very impressive serio-comic film from one of the most distinctive and courageous figures in world cinema," the paper's critic Peter Bradshaw wrote. Variety said Panahi had transformed "from understated humanist to open critic of the Iranian regime, as revealed in his punchy new political thriller". Panahi was presented with the Palme d'Or by French actress Juliette Binoche, who is this year's Cannes jury president, and Australian actress Cate Blanchett.

In South Korea, even your cup of Starbucks could be too political

Starbucks has temporarily disabled the use of six particular names on its app

Walk into any Starbucks in South Korea right now, and there are some names you definitely won't be hearing.

Six to be exact - and they happen to be the names of the candidates running in the upcoming presidential race.

That's because Starbucks has temporarily blocked customers who are ordering drinks from using these names, which would be called out by baristas.

The company said it needed to "maintain political neutrality during election season", adding that this would be lifted after the election on 3 June.

South Korean businesses and celebrities usually strive to be seen as neutral. But it has become more crucial in recent months, as political turmoil triggered by former president Yoon Suk Yeol left the country more divided than ever.

Now, as South Korea gears up to pick its new president following Yoon's impeachment, even the most mundane things can become politicised - a lesson Starbucks has learnt the hard way.

In recent months, it has seen an increasing number of customers ordering drinks through their app and keying in phrases such as "arrest Yoon Suk Yeol" or "[opposition leader] Lee Jae-myung is a spy" as their nicknames.

Starbucks baristas had little choice but to yell out these names once the drinks were ready for collection.

"Our goal is to make sure every customer has a great experience in our coffeehouses," Starbucks said in a statement about its new move to ban the six presidential candidates' names.

"To help with that, we sometimes block certain phrases that could be misunderstood by our employees or customers — like names of political candidates with messages of support or opposition during election season to maintain neutrality."

But this marks the first time it has banned the names of all the candidates running in an election. Besides Lee, the other names are Kim Moon-soo, Lee Jun-seok, Kwon Young-kook, Hwang Kyo-ahn and Song Jin-ho.

Some think the coffee giant is taking things a bit too far.

"I think people are being too sensitive. What if your real name is the same as a candidate's?" said 33-year-old Jang Hye-mi.

Ji Seok-bin, a 27-year-old who is a regular at Starbucks, said he thought the rule was "too trivial", though he said he understood the logic behind it given the country's heightened political tensions.

"After [Yoon's impeachment] I don't really talk about politics anymore. It feels like the ideological divide has grown so much that conversations often turn into arguments."

Homebound: The Indian film that got a nine-minute ovation at Cannes

Dharma Productions Ghaywan's new film Homebound received a nine-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival

In 2010, Indian filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan made a striking debut at Cannes with Masaan - a poignant tale of love, loss, and the oppressive grip of the caste system, set against the holy city of Varanasi. The main lead in the film (Vicky Kaushal) performed a job assigned to one of the lowest castes in the rigid Hindu caste hierarchy – cremating dead bodies along the Ganges. Masaan played in the "Un Certain Regard" section at the festival, which looks at films with unusual styles and or that tells non-traditional stories. It won the FIPRESCI and the Avenir - also known as the Promising Future Prize - prizes. Since then, Ghaywan was in search of a story about India's marginalised communities. Five years ago in the middle of the pandemic, a friend, Somen Mishra - the head of creative development at Dharma Productions in Mumbai - recommended an opinion piece called Taking Amrit Home, published in The New York Times. It was written by the journalist Basharat Peer. What drew Ghaywan to Peer's article was that it tracked the journeys - sometimes of hundreds or even thousands of miles - taken by millions of Indians who travelled on foot to get home during the nation's strict lockdown during the pandemic. But he was also drawn to the core of the story, which focused on the childhood friendship between two men – one Muslim and the other Dalit (formerly known as the untouchables). Ghaywan's new film Homebound, inspired by Peer's article, premiered at Cannes Film Festival's "Un Certain Regard" section this week, ending with a nine-minute long standing ovation.

Dharma Productions Bollywood actor Janhvi Kapoor plays a key role in the film

Many in the audience were seen wiping away tears. Ghaywan gave the lead producer Karan Johar a tight hug, while he and his young lead actors – Ishan Khatter, Vishal Jethwa and Janhvi Kapoor - came together in a larger group hug later. Since this was the biggest South Asian event at Cannes 2025, other film luminaries showed up to support the screening. India's Mira Nair (who won the Camera d'Or in 1988 for Salaam Bombay) leaned across two rows of seats to reach out to Johar. Pakistan's Siam Sadiq (who won the Un Certain Regard Jury Prize in 2022 for Joyland) was seen making a reel of the mood inside the theatre that he later posted on Instagram. The film also received backing from a rather unexpected quarter. Its main producer is Johar, the leading Indian commercial filmmaker (known for blockbuster films like Kabhi Kushi Kabhie Gham and the recent Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahani). But last month Martin Scorsese stepped in as the executive producer after he was introduced to the film by the French producer Mélita Toscan du Plantier. This is the first time Scorsese has stepped in to support a contemporary Indian film. Until now he has only backed restored classic Indian films. "I have seen Neeraj's first film Masaan in 2015 and I loved it, so when Mélita Toscan du Plantier sent me the project of his second film, I was curious," Scorsese said in a statement last month. "I loved the story, the culture and was willing to help. Neeraj has made a beautifully crafted film that's a significant contribution to Indian cinema."

Dharma Productions The film follows the bond between two men played by Ishan Khatter and Vishal Jethwa

According to Ghaywan, Scorsese helped nurture the film by mentoring the team through a number of rounds of edits. But he also tried to understand the cultural context which helped the exchange of ideas. The context was important to Ghaywan, since he had been trying to capture the right spirit of the subject he was tackling. The film's two lead characters – Mohammed Shoaib Ali (Khatter) and Chandan Kumar (Jethwa) have shared histories – the weight of centuries of discrimination at the hand of upper caste Hindus, but also similar goals to rise above the barriers imposed on them - in this case by joining their state's police force. Ghaywan has openly shared that he was born into a Dalit family - a reality that has cast a long shadow over his life, haunting him since childhood. As an adult, he went on to study business administration and then worked in a corporate job in Gurgaon outside the capital, Delhi. He said he never faced discrimination but was acutely aware of his position in the caste hierarchy and still lives with the weight of where he was born. "I am the only acknowledged person from the community who is there behind and in the front of camera in all of Hindi cinema history. That is the kind of gap we are living with," he says.

As clock ticks down on Harry's security court appeal, why did his pleas fail?

Reuters Prince Harry lost his appeal against the government's decision to remove his police protection

Three weeks after Prince Harry's dramatic court loss, any likelihood of him reviving the legal battle over his personal security arrangements is narrowing by the day. His anger and hurt at how he feels his family's security was seemingly lessened, after he stepped back from working royal duties, has played out publicly - and earlier this month he lost his challenge at the Court of Appeal in London. In a week's time, the deadline passes for Prince Harry - the Duke of Sussex - to try one last go, at the Supreme Court. But that seems unlikely after he told the BBC, in his exclusive interview after losing, he had no legal options left. And even if he were to ask for a hearing, the chances of him getting one appear slim because of what the courts have said so far. While the prince's complaint was about his treatment, ultimately the courts took no view on that. Instead, they ruled he had not understood how the body organising Royal Family protection worked - and how his decision to quit the UK, yet still have an "in-and-out" role in public life, was exceptional. One former senior judge, who was not involved and spoke on background, felt the prince's case had been "preposterous" and "hopeless" from the start and anyone else bringing such a flawed claim would have been on the receiving end of more critical language from the courts. However, Prince Harry's argument was always wider - saying the state had to take into account the accident of his birth which made him a target. "I was born into this position. I was born into those risks. And they've only increased over time," he said in the BBC interview. At his first court hearing, in 2023, the prince said the UK was a place where he wanted his children "to feel at home" - but argued that can't happen "if it's not possible to keep them safe". After losing his appeal, he said he "[couldn't] see a world in which I would be bringing my wife and children back to the UK". Harry's entire legal case centred on Ravec - which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office, and which Harry believes unfairly treated him. So, to understand why he lost and seemingly has nowhere else to go, we first have to understand three key issues: - Why was Ravec created, and what is its specific role? - How did Ravec and the Home Office respond when Prince Harry quit as a front line royal? - Why did he think this was something the courts should solve?

Tabloid stunt

Ravec evolved out of a 2003 Daily Mirror stunt when one of its reporters blagged his way into a job as a Buckingham Palace footman. It led to panic in government - and a major review concluded royal security needed a jolt. So Ravec was born - the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (its exact name has changed down the years). Ravec oversees security for key public figures by assessing risks from terrorism, extremism, stalkers and any other foreseeable threat such as a "fixated individual". Unsurprisingly, there is no public list of who gets protected. It is responsible for VIP security within England, Wales and Scotland. The committee is funded and overseen by the Home Office because its work is on behalf of the home secretary of the day. The Royal Household has two members on the committee, including the monarch's private secretary. They contribute what they think is needed to protect people and key locations, such as Buckingham Palace. The Metropolitan Police feeds information into the intelligence assessment and, ultimately provides the officers and kit to protect each "principal" - protected person. But crucially, it's the Home Office-appointed chair who must decide how to spend the money and justify it to government.

Behind closed doors

Part of Prince Harry's case was heard in private, behind closed court doors, to ensure Ravec's precise workings and its security plans remain confidential. We learned Ravec's decisions typically draw on a report from the Risk Management Board (RMB), a Home Office panel pulling together all the facts about risks and actual threats. So, in the example of the prince, it is well-known that al-Qaeda supporters and racist extremists are a concern for his family. We can therefore infer that the RMB has probably tried to work out what those threats really amount to. That's the background. Let's turn to how it all became such a public row, leading from the High Court to the Court of Appeal. The critical decisions were in spring 2020 when Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, "stepped back" from being working royals. Their choice to move first to Canada, with their baby son, raised a question for Ravec: what kind of security should the prince's family now have, if they were no longer working royals and no longer living in the UK? What role should Ravec play in providing security, given its GB-only remit? Court documents, while heavily redacted in places, show emails and letters were flying backwards and forwards between the Home Office, the Palace, Scotland Yard - and ultimately Prince Harry's team. Ravec ruled out very early on allowing the Sussexes to pay the Met to deliver their security abroad. That, it said, was not what Ravec was for. Its task was to protect working royals in GB. The government quickly formed the view that the couple would "essentially become private citizens" living abroad - and relations began to break down on 28 February 2020. Ravec's then-chair, Sir Richard Mottram, told the late Queen's private secretary Sir Edward Young that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would lose their existing Met protection. Sir Richard wrote: "The future arrangements for [the duke and duchess] do not fit readily within this framework." It was that simple: the Sussexes were moving overseas, outside of Ravec's duties.

The consequence was Prince Harry felt he was also being stripped of security when returning home - and there had been no formal Ravec meeting to decide his future protection. In essence, he seemed to be arguing that the Royal Household's two members of the committee - which at the time included Sir Edward - may have influenced the Home Office's decision to reduce his security. In his BBC interview, Harry asked "What is the Royal Household's role [on Ravec]… if it isn't to influence and decide what they want for the members of their household?" But suspecting something is afoot is a world away from proving in court it really is. In fact, the government successfully argued in court that Ravec had thought carefully and fairly about what to do. After the duke and duchess had quit the UK, the committee carried out some threat risk assessments and then committed to decide on the duke's security at home on a case-by-case basis. It meant he would, in principle, potentially get at least some Met Police protection if Ravec thought the circumstances of his visit home warranted it. While living abroad, however, the royal couple would have to fund their own security. Ravec asked Prince Harry and his private security advisers for 28 days' notice of planned returns so it could work out what the state should provide. This notice condition is one of the reasons why the prince says his security had been downgraded. Essentially, he feared he would get a fuller security detail if he were attending a grand royal occasion at home than if he were returning on his own private business.

Prince Harry says he can't see a world where his wife and children will visit the UK and asks for reconciliation with his family

The first test was when he flew in for the funeral of his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, in April 2021. Prince Harry was offered personal protective security - but outside of the Ravec system. The prince regarded this to be insufficient, in light of the risks he believed he faced. His opinion was strengthened two months later when he said he had been dangerously hounded by paparazzi after a charity event. In evidence, his security adviser noted the paparazzi's role in chasing Princess Diana to her death in a Paris tunnel. The prince was convinced he had been treated unfairly and launched his Judicial Review of whether Ravec had acted unlawfully. To win his case, Prince Harry had to land one of three legal arguments: - Ravec had acted unlawfully, beyond the powers it had - The committee had treated him unfairly in the way it had acted - Its decision was so irrational that nobody else sensible could possibly have reached the same conclusion The prince's team did so by arguing Ravec's policy had been overly rigid and inflexible. That failed - but there were other lines of attack: - The committee chairman had not followed Ravec's policies properly - The decision over the prince's future security had lacked transparency and consultation - No other decision-maker could have come up with the same bespoke plan he was offered Yet, all of these complaints were rejected by judges.

Legal cul-de-sac

From teenage Arsenal prodigy to convicted drug smuggler

NCA Jay Emmanuel-Thomas is awaiting sentence for importing cannabis into the UK

As a footballer, Jay Emmanuel-Thomas seemed destined for greatness. But a drug-smuggling conviction has left his career and reputation in tatters. How did things unravel so dramatically for a player once tipped for the top? Hailed by legendary Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger as a footballer who could "play anywhere", Emmanuel-Thomas was marked out early on as having elite potential. Imposing, technically gifted and surprisingly agile, the striker appeared to have the world at his feet. But a career that promised so much at Arsenal faltered and saw him spend years flitting between the second and third tiers of English football. In 2020 he moved to play in Scotland and was still plying his trade north of the border when, on 18 September, he was arrested at his home in Gourock, near Glasgow. Sixteen days earlier, Border Force officers had stopped two women at London Stansted Airport and found drugs in their cases. It was not a minor haul; they were staring at cannabis with a street value of £600,000. How did it get there? The evidence soon led detectives to Emmanuel-Thomas.

Wind back a decade and a half, and things were very different. It is 26 May 2009, and Arsenal's latest batch of academy talents can barely contain their excitement. The young prospects, including Jack Wilshere and Francis Coquelin, have just won the FA Youth Cup. One player in particular has stood out: their 16-year-old captain, Emmanuel-Thomas, who has scored in every round of the competition. "These young men have a very bright future indeed," remarked one commentator. But despite going on to make five first-team appearances, it was not quite to be for Emmanuel-Thomas.

He was shipped out on several loans before leaving the north London club for Ipswich Town. It was a move that excited supporters in Suffolk, who were keen to see what the former Arsenal starlet could produce. However, 71 games and eight goals later, Emmanuel-Thomas had not quite made the mark fans hoped for, and he moved to Bristol City in a player exchange deal.

Here, he helped the Robins secure promotion to the Championship and became something of a cult hero, scoring 21 goals in his first season. A move to Queens Park Rangers followed, with subsequent loan spells at MK Dons and Gillingham.

Getty Images A spell at MK Dons was another step in Emmanuel-Thomas's career

But in 2019, Emmanuel-Thomas accepted a transfer to a Thai-based team that would alter the course of his life. It is believed he was tempted into the country's drugs underworld while playing for PTT Rayong, a club that folded in the same year. Despite later moves to an Indian side and several Scottish outfits, including Aberdeen, Emmanuel-Thomas never shook off the criminal connections he made. By the time he took a six-month contract at Greenock Morton, a 40-minute drive from Glasgow, the game was almost up.

NCA The drugs were intercepted by Border Force officers at London Stansted Airport in Essex

As he lined up for them against Queens Park on 14 September, he would have surely known the law was about to catch up with him. The women arrested at Stansted were his 33-year-old girlfriend, Yasmin Piotrowska, and her friend Rosie Rowland, 28. Emmanuel Thomas, by then 33, appeared in court charged with orchestrating the attempted importation of drugs, and was sacked by his club. Detectives discovered he had duped Ms Piotrowska, from north-west London, and Ms Rowland, from Chelmsford, into travelling to Thailand with the promise of £2,500 in cash and an all-expenses-paid trip. Their job? To bring home two suitcases each, filled with what they were assured was gold, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.

'I feel sorry for the girls'

They flew business class from Bangkok, landing in Essex via Dubai. Unknown to them, they were smuggling in cannabis with a street value of £600,000, vacuum-packed inside the four cases. The pair were stopped and arrested by Border Force officers, before being charged with drug importation offences. With the pair in custody, and Emmanuel-Thomas later remanded, police probed how the drugs made it to the UK. They soon found the player was the intermediary between suppliers in Thailand and dealers in the UK, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA). With the footballer's encouragement, the women had also made a near-identical trip in July, having been made similar promises of cash and a lavish holiday. On his way to custody, Emmanuel-Thomas even told NCA officers: "I just feel sorry for the girls."

How one woman's racist tweet sparked a free speech row

X.com Lucy Connolly called for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire and wrote "if that makes me racist, so be it"

Lucy Connolly's 51-word online post in the wake of the Southport killings led her to jail and into the centre of a row over free speech. For some, the 31-month jail term imposed for inciting race hate was "tyrannical", while one commentator said Connolly was a "hostage of the British state", and another that she was "clearly a political prisoner". Court of Appeal judges, however, this week refused to reduce her sentence. Asked about her case in Parliament, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said sentencing was "a matter for the courts" and that while he was "strongly in favour of free speech", he was "equally against incitement to violence". Rupert Lowe, the independent MP for Great Yarmouth, said the situation was "morally repugnant" and added: "This is not the Britain I want to live in." Others said her supporters wanted a "right to be racist".

Northamptonshire Police Connolly's legal team argued her sentence was "manifestly excessive" but the Court of Appeal disagreed

Warning: This report contains racist and discriminatory language

In July last year, prompted by a false rumour that an illegal immigrant was responsible for the murder of three girls at a dance workshop in Southport, Connolly posted online calling for "mass deportation now", adding "set fire to all the... hotels [housing asylum seekers]... for all I care". Connolly, then a 41-year-old Northampton childminder, added: "If that makes me racist, so be it." At the time she had about 9,000 followers on X. Her message was reposted 940 times and viewed 310,000 times, before she deleted it three and a half hours later. In October she was jailed after admitting inciting racial hatred. Three appeal court judges this week ruled the 31-month sentence was not "manifestly excessive".

PA Media Connolly's appeal was paid for by the Free Speech Union, founded by Lord Toby Young (holding left edge of the banner)

Stephen O'Grady, a legal officer with the Free Speech Union (FSU), said the sentence seemed "rather steep in proportion to the offence". His organisation has worked with Connolly's family since November and funded her appeal. Mr O'Grady said Connolly "wasn't some lager-fuelled hooligan on the streets" and pointed to her being a mother of a 12-year-old daughter, who had also lost a son when he was just 19 months old. He said there was a "difference between howling racist abuse at somebody in the street and throwing bricks at the police" and "sending tweets, which were perhaps regrettable but wouldn't have the same immediate effect".

Free Speech Union Stephen O'Grady said Connolly's case demonstrated "police overreach"

Connolly's case was also "emblematic of wider concerns" about "increasing police interest in people's online activity", Mr O'Grady said. The FSU had received "a slew of queries" from people who were "very unsure" about "the limits of what they can they can say online", he said, and who feared "the police are going to come knocking on the door". "There's an immense amount of police overreach," he added. He cited the example of a retired special constable detained after challenging a pro-Palestine supporter online, a case the FSU took on. Responding to Mr O'Grady's claim, a National Police Chiefs' Council spokesperson said that Article 10 of the Human Rights Act "protects a person's right to hold opinions and to express them freely" and that officers received training about the act. They added: "It remains imperative that officers and staff continue to receive training commensurate with the demands placed upon them."

PA Media Raymond Connolly said the Court of Appeal had shown his wife "no mercy"

After the appeal was dismissed, Connolly's husband, Conservative town councillor Raymond Connolly, said she was "a good person and not a racist" and had "paid a very high price for making a mistake". Her local Labour MP, Northampton South's Mike Reader, said he had "big sympathy" for Connolly and her daughter, but there was no justification for accusing the police of "overreach". He said: "I want the police to protect us online and I want the police to protect us on the streets and they should be doing it equally." It was a "fallacy" and "misunderstanding of the world" if people did not "believe that the online space is as dangerous for people as the streets," he added. "We're all attached to our phones; we're all influenced by what we see, and I think it's right that the police took action here."

PA Media Connolly had pleaded guilty but argued at appeal she had not intended to incite serious violence

In his sentencing remarks, Judge Melbourne Inman said Connolly's offence was "category A" - meaning "high culpability" - and that both the prosecution and her own barrister agreed she "intended to incite serious violence". For Reader, this showed "they weren't arguing this was a silly tweet and she should be let off - her own counsel agreed this was a serious issue". At her appeal, Connolly claimed that while she accepted she intended to stir up racial hatred, she always denied trying to incite violence. But Lord Justice Holroyde said in a judgement this week the evidence "clearly shows that she was well aware of what she was admitting". Sentencing guidelines for the offence indicate a starting point of three years' custody. While the prosecution argued the offence was aggravated by its timing, "particularly sensitive social climate", the defence argued the tweet had been posted before any violence had started, and that Connolly had "subsequently attempted to stop the violence after it had erupted".

The judgement also highlighted other online posts from Connolly that the judges said indicated her "view about illegal immigrants". Four days before the Southport murders, she responded to a video shared by far-right activist Tommy Robinson showing a black man being tackled to the ground for allegedly performing a sex act in public. Connolly posted: "Somalian, I guess. Loads of them," followed by a vomiting emoji. On 3 August, responding to an anti-racism protest in Manchester, she wrote: "I take it they will all be in line to sign up to house an illegal boat invader then. Oh sorry, refugee. "Maybe sign a waiver to say they don't mind if it's one of their family that gets attacked, butchered, raped etc, by unvetted criminals." The FSU said she was likely to be eligible for release from August, after serving 40% of her sentence. Some, including Mr O'Grady, argued her jail term was longer than punishments handed to criminals perceived to have committed "far worse" crimes. Reform UK's Mark Arnull, the leader of West Northamptonshire Council, said it was not for him "to pass comment on sentences or indeed discuss individual cases". But he added: "It's relatively easy to understand why constituents in West Northamptonshire question the proportionality of Lucy's sentence when they see offenders in other high-profile and serious cases walk free and avoid jail."

Shola Mos-Shogbamimu Shola Mos-Shogbamimu believed Connolly's supporters wanted a "right to be racist"

The issue for writer and activist Shola Mos-Shogbamimu was that "those who have committed worse crimes" should "spend more time in jail, not less time for Lucy Connolly". Dr Mos-Shogbamimu added: "It's not 'freedom of speech without accountability'. She didn't tweet something that hurt someone's feelings; she tweeted saying someone should die." In her view, those making Connolly a "flag-bearer or champion" for free speech were asking for "the right to be racist". Free speech advocate Mr O'Grady said "no-one is arguing for an unfettered 'right' to incite racial hatred". Connolly's case was about "proportionality", he added, and "the sense that online speech is increasingly being punished very harshly compared to other offending... such as in-person violent disorder".

France impounds UK vessel accused of illegal fishing

The French coast guard said the British ship had been inspected in French waters by sailors from the Pluvier, a navy patrol vessel

The incident comes days after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was criticised by British fishermen over his reset deal with the European Union, which gives EU fishing vessels access to UK waters for 12 more years.

The vessel was stopped at sea by the French Navy on Thursday night, with its crew alleged to have been fishing in French waters without a licence.

It was seized in the English Channel and is being held at the port of Boulogne, unable to leave while the French authorities consider bringing a prosecution.

A British fishing vessel has been impounded by the French authorities, accused of illegally fishing in their waters.

The Foreign Office said it was offering support to a British national in France and was in touch with local authorities.

"As the vessel remains subject to an ongoing investigation by French fisheries authorities, we are unable to comment further at this time," a government spokesperson added.

According to the French Coastguard, the navy patrol vessel Pluvier was conducting inspections in their waters overnight on 23 May, finding the British vessel to have been allegedly operating without a licence.

The fishing vessel was diverted to Boulogne "for the purpose of initiating prosecution".

The Conservatives accused the French authorities of "shameful double standards" over the arrest.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said they had failed to stop thousands of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats, accusing France of "taking no action whatsoever at sea and often ushering the illegal immigrants into UK waters".

"Yet when a UK fishing vessel is in French waters all of a sudden they are magically able to act. If the French can now intercept boats then they should start stopping the boats with illegal immigrants - as international law obliges them to do."

The UK and the EU have struck a deal that covers fishing, trade, defence, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas still up for negotiation.

A key part of the deal involves giving European fishing boats a further 12 years of access to British waters in exchange for easing some trade frictions.

Critics from the Conservatives and Reform UK described the deal as a "surrender" to the EU, while the Liberal Democrats said the government had taken some "positive first steps" to rebuilding ties with Europe.

Watch: Police said a 39-year-old woman was detained at the scene

Eighteen people were injured in a knife attack at the main railway station in the German city of Hamburg on Friday evening, police said. Hamburg police said on Saturday that four of the victims who had sustained life-threatening injuries were in a stable condition. Officers arrested a 39-year-old German woman at the scene of the attack, which took place at about 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Friday. Police said there was "very concrete evidence" of mental illness in the suspect, and no evidence the attack was politically motivated. The woman remains in police custody and is scheduled to appear in court on Saturday.

The attack happened between platforms 13 and 14 - which are accessible via a busy main road - while a train was on one of the platforms. The suspect began stabbing people waiting for the train, but was stopped by the "rapid intervention" of two people on the platform as well as emergency services, police said. The victims range in age from 19 to 85. Seven people were slightly injured, seven seriously injured, and four critically injured, police said. The critically injured - a 24-year-old female, 24-year-old male, 52-year-old female, and an 85-year-old female - were stable as of Saturday. On Saturday police said there was still no evidence of a political motive for the attack. "Rather, there is now very concrete evidence of a mental illness on the part of the suspect," they said, adding that the woman did not appear to have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol. An investigation is under way. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the attack was "shocking" and thanked the emergency services for "their rapid assistance".

King's invite to Canada sends a message to Trump - and the world

AFP/Getty Images In his first move after his historic election win, Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the King to Canada

A decade ago, a portrait of the British monarch caused a row in Canadian politics. Now, the King is being invited to deliver the Speech from the Throne. What's changed? In 2011, shortly after forming a majority Conservative government, Prime Minister Stephen Harper caused a national uproar when he sought to emphasise Canada's ties to the British monarchy. In one example, he replaced two artworks by a Quebec painter with a portrait of the Queen. Some rebuked the gesture as being out of touch with modern times. Canada has, throughout its 157-year-old history, sought increasing independence from the British monarchy, while still remaining a part of the Commonwealth. When Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau succeeded Harper four years later, the Queen's portrait went down, the Quebec paintings, back up. Fast forward to 2025, and a paradoxical shift has occurred in Canada's relationship with the Crown. In a transparent show of Canada's sovereignty and independence against threats from US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Mark Carney - a Liberal - has invited King Charles the III to open the 45th Canadian parliament.

King Charles uses symbols to show support for Canada

The strategy behind Carney's invite to the King The move is "a huge affirmation and statement about the uniqueness of Canada and its traditions," Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian, told the BBC - "a theatrical display that is meant to show what makes Canadians separate from Americans" and not, as Trump has often repeated, a "51st state". Both countries are former British colonies, but America's founding fathers took a different path and severed all formal connections to the Crown nearly 250 years ago. Canada's separation from the monarchy has been more gradual, and its ties have never been completely broken. Canada's parliamentary system is modelled after Britain's Westminster system. The British monarch is still formally the head of state, but their duties are often carried out by their Canadian representative, called the governor general. Loyalty to the Crown was seen as important to Canada's politicians in the 19th Century who wanted to maintain separation from the US, said Canadian royal historian and commentator Carolyn Harris. That later changed in the 1960s, as Quebec - Canada's majority French-speaking province - began to assert its own distinct identity and threatened separation. This led to an era of politicians like Lester B Pearson and Pierre Elliott Trudeau who worked to untangle Canada from its British colonial past. In 1982, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau repatriated Canada's constitution, giving full legislative power to the federal government and the provinces, and removing it from British parliament. Ms Harris noted that Canada remained a constitutional monarchy throughout these periods. What fluctuated, however, was how much the prime minister of the day chooses to embrace that connection.

Getty Images Trudeau and Queen Elizabeth II signed the Constitution proclamation giving Canada full control of its own constitution in 1982

Carney's invite to King Charles III signals that his government will be one that is much more supportive of the Crown, Mr Vovk said, marking "a very different tone" from previous Liberals. A British monarch has not delivered Canada's throne speech since 1977, and has not opened a brand new session of parliament since 1957, making the King's upcoming visit a truly rare occasion. It comes at a consequential time for Canada. Carney heavily campaigned on standing up to Trump, after the US president spent months undermining Canada's sovereignty by saying it would be better off as a US state. Trump also imposed a series of tariffs that have threatened Canada's economic stability, given that the US is its largest trade partner by far. When announcing the visit last month, Carney called it "a historic honour that matches the weight of our times". He added that the King's visit "clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country". Both historians, Mr Vovk and Ms Harris, noted that the bulk of Canada's modern population is indifferent to the British monarchy. Some are even critical of it. The coronation of King Charles III in 2023 made way for fresh scrutiny of the Crown's historic mistreatment of indigenous people in Canada, and questions on whether the new monarch will move towards reconciliation. Quebec politicians are also still calling for Canada to cut ties with the monarchy. On Friday, the separatist Bloc Québécois party said it will again seek to scrap the need for elected officials to swear allegiance to the King.

From Star Wars to Trainspotting – Ewan McGregor is no stranger to iconic movies. But his antics on the small screen have also stood the test of time. It's 20 years since the Perthshire actor first got on his bike with his best pal Charley Boorman. Since the memorable trip to New York (via several continents) in Long Way Round the pair have covered dozens of countries in the Long Way Up and the Long Way Down. Now, on Apple TV+, the two men are taking the Long Way Home. And this time it's personal.

"We're going from my house to Charley's house in England," McGregor told BBC Scotland News. This would appear to be a simple journey, but it also takes in 15 European countries. And, according to Boorman, McGregor gets a misty look in most of them, then declares: "This looks like a bit of Scotland." The reason the series works is the lifelong friendship between the pair, playing out on screen. Boorman can't believe he gets to keep having adventures with his friend. "Seeing him in front of me or in the mirror, it's a real delight knowing that we are going off doing something we have a real passion and love for. "Doing that with your best mate is a nice feeling."

Ewan McGregor 'saw amazing things' on new road trip show

McGregor adds: "This trip was amazing. I watched the first two episodes and I was thinking I'd like to go and do it again. It was a wonderful experience. "In all the other trips we have had huge distances of riding for days and days, where the landscape never changed. "But this, we had different countries coming at us every couple of days, we met people and saw specifically regional sports. "In Holland we watched a pole vault-y thing over the canals, then we saw snowmobiles over water. "It was nice and the whole idea of going to our house in Scotland to Charley's house in England was a funny idea - but it made sense." One of the highlights was McGregor's send-off from his home in Perthshire. McGregor, his father and uncle are all former members of Morrison's Academy Pipe Band which came to play the bikers off. "It meant a lot to me, meant a lot to my dad to get the band out," said McGregor.

The house where Stanley Kubrick lived while working on iconic films is up for sale. Abbots Mead in Barnet Lane, Elstree, Hertfordshire, was bought by the American director in 1965 and is where he managed productions for films such as The Shining, Barry Lyndon, A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey. The nine-bedroom property, which has a blue plaque dedicated to Kubrick outside, is listed for sale with Savills for a guide price of £6,950,000. He lived at the house for 14 years before moving to Childwickbury Estate, near St Albans, where he stayed until his death in 1999.

Simon Cowell's father, Eric, sold the house to Kubrick. Steven Spencer from Savills Rickmansworth described it as "a wonderful opportunity to own a true piece of filmmaking history". He continued: "The close proximity to Elstree Studios made it the perfect base for Kubrick and his family. "He also worked a lot from home – carefully managing all aspects of four films from his extraordinary body of work from within its four walls."

The house has period features such as ornate staircases, large fireplaces and high ceilings. The garden contains a heated swimming pool, sauna, two greenhouses and an orchard. In addition to the main property, there was also a two-bedroom apartment above one of the garages, and a detached four-bedroom house with its own private garden called Abbots Mead Lodge.

In 2015, his daughter Katharina Kubrick visited the house for a segment for The One Show on BBC One. At the time, she recalled how her father edited films such as Clockwork Orange in the garage. She said: "I remember so clearly one Sunday, some girls came to the door and daddy opened it. "They said, 'Is Stanley Kubrick here?' and he said, 'I'm sorry he's not home'.

He has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), which is caused by a build-up of fluid in the brain and causes problems with his hearing, vision and balance.

The 76-year-old singer-songwriter - known for classic hits like Piano Man, Uptown Girl and We Didn't Start the Fire - is receiving "excellent care" and is "fully committed to prioritising his health", a statement said.

Billy Joel has cancelled all forthcoming tour dates after being diagnosed with a rare brain condition.

"I'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding," he said.

A statement issued on his behalf said Joel's condition "has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance".

It continued: "Under his doctor's instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period.

"Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritising his health.

"He is grateful for the support from fans during this time and looks forward to the day when he can once again take the stage."

NPH is described by the NHS as an uncommon and poorly understood condition that most often affects people over the age of 60.

As well as the two UK dates, he had been due to perform in the US and Canada between this July and July 2026.

He had previously postponed shows in March because of a "medical condition", which was not specified at the time, "to allow him to recover from recent surgery and to undergo physical therapy".

Joel has regularly been on tour in recent years, and ended a record-breaking decade-long monthly residency at Madison Square Garden in New York last year.

He has been nominated for 23 Grammy Awards, winning five times, and was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1999.

Getty Images Salgado dedicated himself to photographing nature and indigenous life in his later years

Sebastião Salgado, regarded as one of the world's greatest documentary photographers, has died at the age of 81. The Brazil-born photographer was known for his dramatic and unflinching black-and-white images of hardship, conflict and natural beauty, captured in 130 countries over 55 years. His hard-hitting photos chronicled major global events such as the Rwanda genocide in 1994, burning oilfields at the end of the Gulf War in 1991, and the famine in the Sahel region of Africa in 1984. "His lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, the power of transformative action," said a statement from Instituto Terra, the environmental organisation he founded with his wife, Lélia Wanick Salgado.

Some of his most striking pictures were taken in his home country, including epic photos of thousands of desperate figures working in open-cast gold mines and striking images of the indigenous people of the Amazon. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva paid tribute, describing Salgado as "one of the best... photographers the world has given us". Salgado's final major project, Amazônia, spotlighted the rainforest's beauty and fragility.

A lifelong advocate for the Amazon's indigenous people, Salgado documented the daily lives of a dozen of the tribes scattered throughout the rainforest - from hunting and fishing expeditions, to dances and rituals. He spent seven years on an ambitious photographic journey, exploring the remote reaches of the Amazon rainforest and documenting its inhabitants. The project culminated in an exhibition showcasing over 200 black-and-white images, offering a poignant glimpse into the region's landscapes and communities. The Amazônia exhibition was displayed at the Science Museum in London and the the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester in 2021 and 2022.

"Sometimes I ask myself, "Sebastião, was it really you that went to all these places?"' he said to an interviewer last year. "Was it really me that spent years travelling to 130 different countries, who went deep inside the forests, into oil fields and mines? "Boy, it really is me who did this. I'm probably one of the photographers who's created the most work in the history of photography."

Born in 1944, Salgado left a career in economics to start as a photographer in 1973. He worked on international assignments for a variety of photography agencies before forming his own, Amazonas Images, with Lélia in 1994. He received the Sony World Photography Awards' Outstanding Contribution to Photography in 2024. Other accolades included the Prince of Asturias Award and recognition as a Unicef Goodwill Ambassador.

Taylor Swift won't face summons in Baldoni-Lively case

Taylor Swift has been described in legal documents as one of Blake Lively's "dragons"

But the subpoena was dropped after Swift's legal team objected that the legal order amounted to an "unwarranted fishing expedition", Variety said.

Baldoni's lawyers had sent subpoenas to Swift and her legal team in an attempt to obtain messages between lawyers representing Lively and the singer, who are friends, Variety reported .

Baldoni and Lively co-starred in 2024 film It Ends With Us, but are now embroiled in a bitter legal dispute after she sued the actor and director, accusing him of sexual harassment and a smear campaign.

Taylor Swift will not be drawn into the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni after a court summons for the pop star was withdrawn.

Lively and Baldoni starred together in It Ends With Us, which was released last summer

Lively's spokesperson said they were "pleased" the subpoena had been withdrawn.

"We supported the efforts of Taylor's team to quash these inappropriate subpoenas directed to her counsel and we will continue to stand up for any third party who is unjustly harassed or threatened in the process," they said.

Earlier this month, Swift's representatives told the BBC she was being brought into a legal row to create "tabloid clickbait".

It was originally reported that Swift had been subpoenaed to give information after it was alleged she tried to pressure Baldoni to accept script rewrites by Lively for the film.

Baldoni had said he was invited to Lively's New York home in 2023 to discuss script changes, where Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds, and Swift were there to serve as her "dragons".

In response, Swift's representatives said "she was not involved in any casting or creative decision" and "never saw an edit or made any notes on the film".

Variety has now reported that Baldoni's lawyers were using the subpoena to try to get messages relating to an allegation that Lively's representatives had threatened to release old text messages if Swift didn't issue a statement supporting her.

Lively's lawyers denied those allegations as "unequivocally and demonstrably false".

Lively's spokesperson added: "The Baldoni and Wayfarer team have tried to put Taylor Swift, a woman who has been an inspiration for tens of millions across the globe, at the center of this case since day one.

"Faced with having to justify themselves in federal court, they folded. At some point they will run out of distractions from the actual claims of sexual harassment and retaliation they are facing."

Baldoni is counter-suing Lively and Reynolds on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.

Actor Jussie Smollett to pay $50,000 to Chicago charity

Actor Jussie Smollett has agreed to pay $50,000 (£37,000) to a charity in Chicago, settling a lawsuit the city had filed against him over accusations of lying about a hate crime.

Chicago police had wanted Smollett to pay $130,000 to cover the investigation costs, but on Thursday, Chicago's law department confirmed that the donation will be made instead.

The money will go to Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts, an organisation that supports Chicago's underprivileged youth.

In 2019, Smollett said he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack. But in a case that has seen many twists and turns, he was charged with lying to police. The charges were later dropped, and Smollett has always maintained it was not a hoax.

Sirat to Eddington and Sentimental Value: The 12 Cannes films you need to know about

22 hours ago Share Save Rebecca Laurence, Hugh Montgomery and Nicholas Barber Share Save

This year's Cannes Film Festival finishes today – and from the hundreds of titles that premiered, here are the ones which are going to be big talking points all through 2025.

1. Die, My Love

With the combined star power of Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson and the arthouse credentials of acclaimed Scottish film-maker Lynne Ramsay (Morvern Callar, We Need to Talk about Kevin), Die, My Love was one of the most eagerly anticipated titles going into Cannes, where it sold to Mubi for $24m (£17.8m). Adapted from a 2017 novel by Ariana Harwicz, it sees Lawrence and Pattinson play a loved-up couple whose relationship unravels after a move to the countryside and the birth of their baby, and centres on the psychotic breakdown of Lawrence's character. At a festival event, Ramsay criticised journalists' read of the film as purely about postpartum psychosis, however, saying it was instead "about a relationship breaking down, it's about love breaking down, and sex breaking down after having a baby. And it's also about a creative block". Critics praised the cast in particular, which includes Sissy Spacek, LaKeith Stanfield and Nick Nolte – but the film belongs to Lawrence's raw, sensual-but-humorous performance. "What Lawrence does in Die, My Love is so delicately textured, even within its bold expressiveness, and its fiery anger, that it leaves you scrambling for adjectives," writes Stephanie Zacharek in Time, while the BBC's Nicholas Barber calls her "better than ever". (RL)

2. Sound of Falling

Even by Cannes' standards, Sound of Falling is an extraordinarily ambitious, richly textured and beautiful work of art. Mascha Schilinski's second feature film is all set in and around the same farmhouse in Germany, but it slips between four different time periods. We see the same characters as young children and as old people; we hear the traumas that echo through the generations. It can be challenging to figure out how everyone is connected to everyone else, and in some ways Sound of Falling is more reminiscent of a novel than a typical film. But Schilinski conjures up haunting, immersive effects that are only possible on the big screen. "Cinema is too small a word for what this sprawling yet intimate epic achieves in its ethereal, unnerving brilliance," said Damon Wise in Deadline. Forget Cannes, forget the Competition, forget the whole year, even – Sound of Falling is an all-timer." (NB)

3. Pillion

Arguably, no film had a more striking premise this year than this British feature playing in the Un Certain Regard sidebar: a gay BDSM romance, featuring Hollywood star Alexander Skarsgård as Ray, a "dom", leather-clad biker living in the London suburbs who finds a "sub" in the form of adorkable car park inspector Colin, played by Harry Potter star Harry Melling. But the film itself was no mere provocation, instead providing a sharply observed and creditably knotty inquiry into such a relationship. Initially, as the inexperienced, nerdy Colin is thrust into a whole new world of sexual transgression, the film seems to occupy classic Brit-com territory in its quirky, farcical tone, despite the boundary-pushing subject matter. But it also darkens as it goes on, leaving the audience to reflect on whether such degrading role-play is plain emotional abuse; events reach a climax with an electric, excruciating lunch scene, in which Colin's mother (a brilliant Lesley Sharp) confronts Ray about his treatment of her son. Some reviewers such as David Rooney in The Hollywood Reporter found it "unexpectedly sweet" though for me, it was far more troubling than that – a sign, perhaps, of the kind of divided opinions that it may inspire when it is unleashed on the general public. (HM)

4. Eddington

A wild and chaotic comedy thriller from Ari Aster, the director of Hereditary and Midsommar, Eddington stars Joaquin Phoenix as a bungling small-town sheriff who imagines himself to be the straight-talking hero of his story, but might just be its devious and detestable villain. The setting is New Mexico in 2020. Aster pokes despairing fun at the ways Americans reacted to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Black Lives Matter protests, and the other events that defined that strange year, making this one of the only major US films to grapple with so many divisive contemporary political issues. Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone and Austin Butler co-star in what Sophie Monks Kaufman of the Independent called "Aster's funniest film to date". The "well-observed" Eddington "has a sweep that shows that the Wild West still exists on the ground and online," she writes, "and a keen eye for the people that grow in a sandy, mountain-flanked, lonely landscape". (NB)

5. The Secret Agent

Kleber Mendonça Filho's 1977 Brazil-set thriller about a man on the run is one of the favourites to scoop Cannes' top honour, the Palme d'Or. Looking ahead, it looks likely to follow in the footsteps of I'm Still Here, another film set under the Brazilian dictatorship of the 1970s, which won the Oscar for best international film at the 2025 Academy Awards. At two hours and 40 minutes, The Secret Agent takes its sweet time to unravel, before an exhilarating and bloody final chase and a poignant coda that echoes I'm Still Here in its reflection on the legacy of this turbulent period in Brazil's history. The sympathetic protagonist, Marcelo, is played by Wagner Moura, in a charismatic performance that is tipped for acting nods come awards season. In his five-star review, The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw writes: "The Secret Agent doesn't have the imperatives of a conventional thriller and expecting these will cause impatience. It's more novelistic in its way: a movie of character, a showcase for Moura's complex, sympathetic performance but also the platform for some thrilling, bravura film-making." (RL)

6. Sentimental Value

Joaquin Trier's The Worst Person in the World was a smash at Cannes in 2021, and went on to be nominated for two Oscars. Now the Norwegian director is back with another insightful comedy drama set in Oslo, with the same luminous star, Renate Reinsve. In Sentimental Value, she plays a famous theatre and television actress. Her obnoxiously self-centred father, played by Stellan Skarsgard, is a heavyweight film director, but he hasn't been able to raise money for a new project in 15 years. Could that be why he has written a screenplay especially for his celebrated daughter? Or could the proposed film be a sincere effort to fix the problems between them? "On its surface, the film may touch on the familiar theme of how artists draw from their own lives," said Tim Grierson in Screen International, "but Renate Reinsve and Stellan Skarsgard bring incredible tenderness to a story that is ultimately about what children and parents never say to one another." (NB)

7. Sirat

For all the projects with big name talent involved, one of the real joys of Cannes is when films that came into the festival as relatively unknown quantities finish it as major talking points, thanks to their sheer bold, bonkers brilliance. Such has been the case this year with Sirat, Spanish director Oliver Laxe's first film in the main competition, which has left people equal parts enraptured and stressed, even as they have struggled to explain what it’s all about. But here goes: beginning at a Moroccan desert rave, whose increasing sketchiness sets the skew-whiff tone, it focuses on a father looking for his missing daughter. As military forces come to break up the gathering, an apocalyptic element is introduced to the story, before the story morphs into a touching road movie, as the father and his young son join a merry band of hedonists driving through the mountains on their way to another event. But then a series of shocking twists change everything, turning this into an existential drama, with blackly comic edges, that is part Mad Max, part Samuel Beckett – or as Jessica Kiang in Variety called it, a "brilliantly bizarre, cult-ready vision of human psychology tested to its limits". With its earth-shattering techno-flavoured sound design and awe-inspiring cinematography of the arid North African landscape, this is also, it should be noted, the most ravishingly epic of this year's entrants – and that combined with its shock factor could well make it a watercooler film beyond the festival circuit. (HM)

8. The Chronology of Water

Ever since shooting straight to the top of the A-list with Twilight, Kristen Stewart has made intelligent, challenging choices with her career, largely eschewing blockbusters for daring, imaginative arthouse projects. So it's no surprise really that her first film behind the camera should have proved to be such a deeply-felt work, in its exploration of womanhood and trauma, marking her out as a film-maker of real vision. Based on a memoir by writer Lidia Yuknavitch – played by a blazing, no-holds-barred Imogen Poots – it tells a powerful story of her struggle to process her pain through art, taking in her abusive childhood, battles with drugs and a heartrending stillbirth among other things. Except, as signalled by the title, nothing is in traditional narrative order: rather Stewart attempts to immerse us in Yuknavitch's consciousness via a fragmentary collage of images and life moments. As David Fear in Rolling Stone says , the result is "radical, bruising, and aggressive in its honesty" – even if sometimes, you wish Stewart would allow for some more conventional scenes to play out, to better appreciate the strong supporting performances in particular, including Thora Birch as Yuknavitc's grounding sister and Jim Belushi as her mentor, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest author Ken Kesey. But its more impressionistic power means it's the kind of film that lingers with, and haunts you, well after the credits have rolled – and, for that reason, as well as its director's popularity, it could well pick up a devoted fanbase. (HM)

9. Urchin

One theme at this year's festival was well-received films made by actors who were trying their hand at being writer-directors. Alongside Scarlett Johansson and Kristen Stewart, Harris Dickinson (Babygirl) made his behind-the-camera debut with Urchin, a sharp, slyly comic drama about a middle-class young man (Frank Dillane) who has been a homeless drug addict for years. It's a daring film, in that it doesn't try to make its protagonist likeable, nor does it explain how someone from a well-off background ended up on the streets. Dickinson is typically impressive when he turns up in a few scenes himself, but Urchin suggests that he could do as much directing as acting from now on. His previous roles "appear to have functioned as an informal film school", says David Rooney in The Hollywood Reporter, "equipping him to tackle a much-trafficked subject in ways that are thoughtful, distinctive and clearly culled from close study of a highly specific world." (NB)

10. My Father's Shadow

Cannes may certainly be the premier platform for world cinema as a whole, but not every part of the globe is equally represented – and it certainly comes as a shock that this year's edition is the first ever to play host to a Nigerian film in its official selection. Certainly, though, after the impact My Father's Shadow made on the Croisette, you'd hope to see plenty more Nigerian entries following in its footsteps in coming years: Akinola Davies Jr's debut feature was received with universal warmth, offering a beautiful, poignant depiction of childhood memory, set against a crux point in the country's history in the early '90s. The focus is on two young boys, who are taken by their frequently absent but beloved father Folarin (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù) on a trip into the Nigerian capital Lagos – on the very same day that the country's first democratic elections in 10 years are set to anoint a president. What follows is a vibrant, richly-textured and finally powerfully melancholic portrait of a parent and child snatching precious time together amid a society on the edge. As The Telegraph's Tim Robey said in his five star review: "The film is magically nimble, encompassing so much life so pithily in a day. It dreams of a future – for country and family – and mourns the theft of what might have been." (HM)

11. Nouvelle Vague

Richard Linklater's tribute to auteur Jean-Luc Godard is a peek-behind-the-scenes of the making of Godard's classic 1960 crime caper Breathless (À bout de souffle). A love letter to French cinema, the Cahiers du Cinéma writers group and the revolutionary 1960s "new wave", Linklater's film could have been tailor-made for the Cannes Film Festival – it even features a few Cannes in-jokes that provoked indulgent smirks in screenings. Linklater's film is a light confection, but an expertly executed one – from its uncanny casting (Guillaume Marbeck as Godard, Aubry Dullin as Jean-Paul Belmondo and Zoey Deutch as Jean Seberg are all perfect) to its propulsive, jazzy score. "A labour of love and a product of considerable craft…" writes Ben Croll in The Wrap, "[Nouvelle Vague is] more than just a valentine to the French New Wave; the film is also a stealth showcase for a film-maker rarely heralded (or for that matter, tribuned) for his technical sophistication." (RL)

12. It Was Just an Accident

Never mind Tom Cruise. As far as cinephiles were concerned, one of the Cannes' biggest events was the presence of Jafar Panahi. In the past, Iran's regime has banned the beloved director from making films and from travelling, so it was a cause for celebration that he was able to come to the festival – and to bring an excellent new film with him. It Was Just an Accident is a farcical revenge thriller about a group of ordinary citizens who think they have found the interrogator who tortured them when they were in prison, but who can't be certain that they've got the right man. The film is fuelled by rage at the brutality of Iran's dictatorship, but is miraculously humane and funny, too. Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian said, "It's another very impressive serio-comic film from one of the most distinctive and courageous figures in world cinema." (NB)

Karate Kid: Legends

Cobra Kai began life as a YouTube series which picked up from where the 40-year-old Karate Kid franchise left off. In short, it didn't sound like essential viewing. But the series went on to be an Emmy-nominated, critically acclaimed, six-season hit, and it put the star of the 1984 film, Ralph Macchio, back in the limelight. Now Macchio is starring in a Karate Kid sequel, Karate Kid Legends, featuring Ben Wang as the new Kid on the block, a Chinese teenager who learns to fight bullies in New York. Confusingly, Legends follows the continuity of the original Karate Kid films, as well as the Cobra Kai series, but it also brings in Jackie Chan's Mr Han, who was in the 2010 Karate Kid remake. Still, Macchio promises that all the elements in this shared universe will be in balance – and as Mr Miyagi once explained, "Balance is key". "Once we were able to line that up, for the Cobra Kai story to lead into the new film – even though they're separate ecosystems – it all made sense for me," Macchio said in Variety. "Then, working with Jackie was just super exciting. I started this on the big screen. How cool is it to get it back to the big screen?"

Bring Her Back

Danny and Michael Philippou are the Australian twins who made Talk to Me, a terrifically creepy indie horror film which was an international hit in 2023. It was such a success, in fact, that you might have expected the Philippous to move straight onto a sequel, or even to a Hollywood blockbuster. Instead, the brothers stayed in their hometown of Adelaide and made another low-budget horror film with an original story: Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins as a foster mother, Laura, who is trying to contact the dead. Thematically, this supernatural chiller is closely related to Talk to Me, although it's been given extra depth by a death in the Philippou family. "We were doing pre-production meetings, then we started shooting, and there was no time to properly sort through those emotions," Danny Philippou said in Den of Geek. "They sort of poured themselves out in the script and in conversations with Sally, so that bled into the character of Laura and scenes that were meant to be scary suddenly turned sad. I think there's a rawness in it that wasn't in Talk to Me."

Deaf President Now!

The co-director of Deaf President Now!, Nyle DiMarco, says that his documentary tells "the story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of". Its setting is Gallaudet University in Washington DC, the world's first university for deaf and hard of hearing students. Gallaudet was established in 1864, but for more than a century, none of its presidents was deaf. In 1988, when the board of trustees appointed yet another hearing president over two deaf candidates, the students wouldn't stand for it. Eight days of protests followed – and four of the protesters are interviewed in the film. Co-directed by Davis Guggenheim, who made the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth and Still: A Michael J Fox Movie, Deaf President Now! is "a firebrand historical documentary that is as crowd-pleasing and informative as it is innovative and inclusive", says Marya E Gates at RobertEbert.com.

Final Destination: Bloodlines

There were five Final Destination films from 2000 to 2011, all with the same structure. First, there would be a spectacular catastrophe; then this sequence would be revealed to be someone's premonition; then the person who had the premonition would save a handful of people from the catastrophe when it actually happened; but then those people would be claimed by Death, one by one, usually via complicated accidents. Now the gleefully grisly franchise is back from the dead, so prepare to squeal and squirm at yet more ingeniously nasty killings. But Final Destination: Bloodlines has moved on from the previous films in one respect. According to the trailer, it turns out that all of the victims in the previous five films were descended from people who were saved from one particular catastrophe, decades ago. That means that the film isn't just about a group of strangers, but a family that is trying to break an inherited curse. "Suddenly, the five films are not just one fun, gory rollercoaster ride after another, but a series with a lot of interweaving emotional weight," says Shawn Van Horn in Collider. "Those stronger relationships are going to make the characters more three-dimensional, and we'll likely be rooting for their survival rather than relishing in the bloodshed." Well… maybe.

Another Simple Favour

In 2018, Paul Feig's A Simple Favour finished with Blake Lively's glamorous killer being jailed for 20 years, and with Anna Kendrick's widowed mother finding fame as a crime-solving vlogger, so a sequel didn't seem likely. But the film prided itself on its outrageous plot twists, so maybe it's appropriate that, seven years on, Lively's character is not just free from prison, but is about to marry a wealthy Italian on the island of Capri – and she is determined that her old frenemy should be her maid of honour. A Simple Favour was a devilish comedy noir that treated viewers to deceit, betrayal, murder, and the sight of Lively sipping martinis while wearing absurdly stylish outfits. Another Simple Favour is even more lavish in its fashions, and even more head-spinning in its plotting. Kristy Puchko in Mashable calls it a "shapeshifting creature, transforming in tone moment to moment to revel in biting humour, relish in mob drama [and] plunge into the delicious depths of mad women in the psycho-biddy subgenre". Fans of the first film will "cherish this divinely twisted thriller".

Friendship

Tim Robinson, a Saturday Night Live alumnus with his own sketch show, Netflix's I Think You Should Leave, has his first big-screen leading role in Friendship. And, true to form, it will make you cringe as much as laugh. Robinson plays Craig, a suburban office worker who is too awkward to have any real friends. Then he meets his neighbour, Brian (Paul Rudd), a weatherman who plays in a punk band in his spare time, which makes him fabulously cool by Craig's standards. Craig is thrilled to hang out with his Brian and his buddies, but after he ruins one social occasion too many, Brian "breaks up" with him, and he spirals out of control. Written and directed by Andrew DeYoung, this bromantic black comedy is "feverishly and hilariously demented", says Nick Schager in the Daily Beast. "Partnered with the always ridiculous Rudd, Robinson reconfirms his standing as the reigning master of discomfort. Together, they make Friendship the funniest movie of the year."

Walt Disney

Lilo & Stitch

Admittedly, the last of Disney's live-action remakes, Snow White, was (a) dogged by controversy, and (b) not very good, but Lilo & Stitch looks a lot more promising. The film retells the story a genetically engineered, blue-furred alien called Experiment 626, or Stitch. He is so destructive that he is condemned to be exiled to an asteroid, but he escapes from the interstellar authorities and crash-lands on Earth, where he is befriended by a Hawaiian girl, Lilo. The original 2002 film, then, was one of the few Disney cartoons to have a modern-day US setting, and one of the few to mix contemporary human beings with fantastical creatures – so, for once, a remake that has both live-action and CGI characters makes total sense. Another good sign is that the film is directed by Dean Fleischer Camp, who made the Oscar-nominated charmer Marcel the Shell with Shoes On. And a third key factor is that, in the trailers, Maia Kealoha, who plays Lilo, seems to have the most adorable chemistry with an alien since Drew Barrymore was in ET The Extra Terrestrial.

The Surfer

Nicolas Cage doesn't appear in many subtle dramas these days, so you may not be surprised to hear that The Surfer is "a gloriously demented B-movie thriller", as Xan Brooks puts it in The Observer, or that Cage cranks "the acting dial from befuddled to vexed to outraged to volcanic". He plays an unnamed businessman who has returned to Australia after years in California, and who wants to buy the beachfront house where he grew up. But when he tries to surf in a nearby bay, he is harassed by a gang of locals led by a shamanic thug (Julian McMahon). Cage's character won't be put off, though, and camps out in the car park above the beach, sacrificing his possessions and his sanity in the process. "Crisply scripted by Thomas Martin and directed by Lorcan Finnegan with a pleasing, no-frills intensity," says Brooks, "The Surfer [is] a low-budget, hard-hitting comic bruiser of a picture: a midlife-crisis movie dressed up as a 1970s exploitation flick [with a] wild, roiling, hallucinogenic vibe."

Jane Austen Wrecked My Life

Jane Austen may be turning 250 in December, but film and TV directors are as smitten by her novels as ever. Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden are starring in a new Netflix adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, and before that there is a French romantic comedy drama, Jane Austen Wrecked My Life, written and directed by Laura Piani. Camille Rutherford stars as Agathe, who works in a bookshop in Paris, but dreams of becoming an author. With the encouragement of her friend Felix (Pablo Pauly), she accepts the offer of a writing residency in England set up by the Austen estate. Will she finish her novel at last? Will she come to see Felix as more than a friend? Or will she fall for one of the residency's organisers (Charlie Anson), a handsome toff who happens to be the great-great-great-great-nephew of Austen herself? "The film is a delightful ode to Jane Austen's novels, serving up a unique blend of humour and introspection that reflects both European sensibilities and the particular quirks of Austen's world," says Louisa Moore in Screen Zealots.

Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning

The original Mission: Impossible TV series ran for just seven years, but the film series has been running for 29 – and its star, Tom Cruise, does plenty of running himself. Could the franchise be coming to a conclusion at last? The subtitle of the eighth instalment, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, suggests that Ethan Hunt won't be choosing to accept any more missions after this one, so this could be the last time we'll see Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Hayley Atwell crashing cars and jumping off buildings. On the other hand, Cruise is refusing to confirm whether or not Hunt will live to fight another day. "You gotta see the movie," he told Empire magazine. "It's a hard thing for me to discuss at the moment, because it really is something that you have to experience." The film's director, Christopher McQuarrie, is also being cagey, but he does acknowledge that the word "Final" is in there for a reason. "It is, I hope, the satisfying conclusion to a 30-year story arc," he says. "I'm pretty confident that people are going to feel that the title was appropriate."

Thunderbolts*

"After years of misfires, disappointments, and a growing sense of superhero fatigue, the MCU looks poised for a comeback with the highly anticipated arrival of Thunderbolts," says Linda Marric in HeyUGuys, "a gritty but mostly fun new adventure that just might put Marvel back on top." The idea behind this rough-edged spy caper is that Marvel's least powerful, least glamorous, and least fulfilled superheroes have been carrying out covert missions for a shady businesswoman (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When she decides that they're expendable, these grumpy loners are forced to form a ragtag team consisting of Florence Pugh's Yelena, David Harbour's Red Guardian, Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier, Wyatt Russell's US Agent, and Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost. "It is a film that makes us truly care about its characters and their well-being," says Marric. "It's gritty, chaotic and sometimes uneven, but also thrilling and unexpectedly heartfelt. Best of all, it proves Marvel can still surprise us when it stops trying to please everyone and leans into the weirdness."

كشفت كتائب الشهيد عز الدين القسام، الجناح العسكري لحركة المقاومة الإسلامية (حماس)، عن تنفيذ عملية مزدوجة استهدفت قوة من جيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي كانت تتحصن داخل منزل في بلدة القرارة شرق مدينة خان يونس جنوبي قطاع غزة.

وجاء في بيان صادر عن الكتائب اليوم الأحد أن "مجاهدي القسام، وبعد عودتهم من خطوط المواجهة، أكدوا أنهم فجروا المنزل بعدد من العبوات الناسفة الشديدة الانفجار، مما أدى إلى انهياره وسقوط عدد من الجنود الإسرائيليين بين قتيل وجريح".

وأضاف البيان أن "مجاهدي القسام فجروا أيضا عين نفق في مجموعة من الجنود الذين وصلوا إلى المكان، وجرى اشتباك مباشر معهم باستخدام الأسلحة الخفيفة، كما تم رصد هبوط طائرات مروحية إسرائيلية لإخلاء المصابين من موقع العملية".

وأوضحت الكتائب في بيانها أن العملية نفذت صباح يوم الثلاثاء الموافق 20 مايو/أيار الجاري، مشيرة إلى أنها "تأتي في إطار الرد على جرائم الاحتلال واستمرارا لمسيرة المقاومة".

ويتزامن البيان مع ما ذكرته مواقع إسرائيلية عن هبوط مروحيات لجيش الاحتلال لإخلاء جنود جرحى وقتلى في حدث أمني يتكتم الجيش حتى اللحظة على تفاصيله، مشيرة إلى وقوع إصابتين بجروح خطيرة.

إعلان

ووفقا لمعطيات جيش الاحتلال، قُتل 854 ضابطا وجنديا منذ بداية الحرب على غزة في 7 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2023، بمن فيهم 413 عسكريا في معارك برية.

وتشير المعطيات الإسرائيلية إلى إصابة 5846 ضابطا وجنديا منذ بداية الحرب، منهم 2641 عسكريا في معارك برية، وتشمل هذه المعطيات الضباط والجنود القتلى والجرحى في غزة والضفة الغربية ولبنان وإسرائيل، لكنها لا تشمل عناصر الشرطة والمخابرات.

وخلافا للأرقام المعلنة، يُتهم الجيش الإسرائيلي بإخفاء الأرقام الحقيقية لخسائره في الأرواح، خاصة مع تجاهل إعلانات عديدة للمقاومة الفلسطينية بتنفيذ عمليات وكمائن ضد عناصره، تؤكد أنها تسفر عن قتلى وجرحى.

وبدعم أميركي، ترتكب إسرائيل منذ 7 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2023 جرائم إبادة جماعية في قطاع غزة، خلّفت أكثر من 176 ألف فلسطيني بين شهيد وجريح، معظمهم أطفال ونساء، وما يزيد على 11 ألف مفقود، بجانب مئات الآلاف من النازحين.

نشرت صحيفة "هآرتس" تحقيقا كشفت فيه أن الشركة التي أعلن مؤخرا عن إنشائها لتوزيع المساعدات الإنسانية في قطاع غزة ليست سوى نتاج جهد من فريق مقرب من رئيس الوزرء بنيامين نتنياهو عمل دون علم الأجهزة الأمنية لاختيار شركة غير معروفة ولا تملك خبرة لتنسيق العمليات الإنسانية.

وأوضح التحقيق الذي نشر اليوم الأحد أن المؤسسة -التي سجلت منظمة غير ربحية في سويسرا تحت اسم "مؤسسة غزة الإنسانية"- قدمت نفسها على أنها أميركية، إلا أن عناصر إسرائيلية تقف وراءها، وتثار الكثير من التساؤلات بشأنها.

ونقلت "هآرتس" عن مصادر في المؤسسة الأمنية، حاليون وسابقون، أنهم تفاجؤوا باختيار الشركة "المجهولة"، وأكدوا أن الاختيار تم في عملية سرية أشرف عليها اللواء رومان غوفمين السكرتير العسكري لنتنياهو، من دون مناقصة أو المرور عبر القنوات المعتادة أو منسق أعمال الحكومة بالضفة وغزة، كما تم استبعاد الجيش ووزارة الدفاع بشكل كامل من عملية الاختيار.

وتحدثت المصادر عن تفاصيل عملية الاختيار عبر اتصالات ولقاءات داخل إسرائيل وخارجها، وتحويلات مالية بملايين الشواكل دون علم كبار المسؤولين في المؤسسة الأمنية، وأشار مسؤولون إلى أن تلك التفاصيل أثارت شكوكا حول "سلوك غير لائق" و"مصالح شخصية" لبعض المشاركين في العملية التي تشير تقديرات إلى أنها ستكلف إسرائيل نحو 200 مليوني دولار خلال 6 أشهر.

إعلان

وقالت "هآرتس" إنه في ضوء علامات الاستفهام المتزايدة، هناك شعور متزايد بين كثيرين في المؤسسة الأمنية الاسرائيلية بأن هناك مصالح شخصية واقتصادية في هذه القضية، ويعزز ذلك الشعور استمرار الحرب، وتفاقم الأزمة الإنسانية في قطاع غزة، والحاجة المتزايدة لكيان جديد يتولى مهمة تقديم المساعدات .

ونقلت الصحيفة عن مصدر أنّ الأمم المتحدة رفضت التعاون مع الشركة المجهولة لتوزيع المساعدات بغزة وثمة شكوك بشأن قدرتها على العمل من أجل الفلسطينيين.

وكشفت "هآرتس" أن المسؤولين عن المؤسسة الجديدة -وبينهم شخص يدعى فيل رايلي، وهو مسؤول كبير سابق في وكالة الاستخبارات المركزية الأميركية– يقفون أيضا وراء شركة أخرى تدعى "أوربيس" التي عملت في وقت سابق في غزة، وأشرفت على على تأمين محور نتساريم خلال فترة وقف إطلاق النار في غزة بين يناير/ كانون الأول ومارس/ آذار الماضيين.

وأوضحت الصحيفة أن "مجموعة "أوربيس" تضم أيضا شركة أخرى باسم "يو إس سولوشنز" بدأت في تجنيد المحاربين القدامى في الجيش الأميركي الذين لديهم ما لا يقل عن 4 سنوات من الخبرة القتالية للقيام بـ"مهام أمنية وجهود إنسانية"، وقالت الشركة إن أولوية التوظيف ستكون للمتحدثين باللغة العربية الذين يتقنون اللهجات المصرية أو الأردنية أو العراقية أو اللبنانية.

خلال الأسبوع الأخير من الشهر الماضي، أقرت إدارة شركة ميرسك العالمية المتخصصة في الشحن البحري -في تصريحات لشبكة الجزيرة- بأنها تشحن قطع مقاتلات "إف-35" إلى إسرائيل، لكنها بررت ذلك بأن قطع "إف-35" المنقولة عبر سفنها تتوجه إلى أطراف أخرى في إسرائيل، وليس إلى وزارة الدفاع.

وأضافت الشركة للجزيرة أن برنامج صناعة طائرات "إف-35" باعتباره سلسلة إنتاج معقدة تنخرط فيه مجموعة من الدول، بما في ذلك إسرائيل التي تصنع أجنحة هذه الطائرات.

لكن هذا التقرير الذي أعدته حركة الشباب الفلسطيني المؤيدة للفلسطينيين وخصت به الجزيرة نت يكشف حقيقة الدور الذي تلعبه شركة ميرسك في سلسلة توريد الأسلحة العالمية، التي تدعم حرب الإبادة التي ينفذها جيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي في قطاع غزة، والتي أسفرت حتى الآن عن سقوط عشرات آلاف الضحايا من المدنيين بين شهيد وجريح ومفقود، معظمهم من النساء والأطفال.

يكشف تقرير حركة الشباب الفلسطيني تورط شركة ميرسك المباشر في برنامج الطائرات المقاتلة "إف-35" التي تعتبر السلاح الأهم في حرب الإبادة الإسرائيلية على غزة.

تورط عميق

ويعتبر تقرير حركة الشباب الفلسطيني أن ميرسك ليست مجرّد شركة شحن، بل تلعب دورا مركزيا في إنتاج ونقل الإمدادات العسكرية التي تُبقي آلة الحرب الإسرائيلية فعالة، كما تقول إن لديها أدلة دامغة تثبت التورط العميق لشركة الشحن العملاقة في إنتاج وتجميع المعدات العسكرية، وتسهيل شحنات تضمن بقاء القدرة القتالية الإسرائيلية في أوجها.

إعلان

وبالاقتران مع تقارير سابقة، تُظهر هذه النتائج أن تورّط ميرسك يشمل مراحل سلسلة التوريد كافة، من تصنيع المكونات، إلى تجميع الأسلحة، إلى تسليمها لاستخدامها في العدوان العسكري الإسرائيلي.

وقالت الحركة -في تقريرها- إن ما لديها من أدلة تعزز الحاجة الملحّة إلى مساءلة الشركات عن دورها في دعم الاحتلال والحروب، وضرورة التحرك الجماعي.

وأضافت أن مسؤولية مواجهة هذه السلسلة تقع على عاتق الحكومات والناشطين والمجتمع المدني، للمطالبة بإنهاء تواطؤ الشركات في العدوان العسكري الإسرائيلي وانتهاكات حقوق الإنسان، لا سيّما في ظل حملة الإبادة الإسرائيلية الجارية في غزة.

أجنحة الطائرة

ووفق التقرير، فقد تولّت ميرسك شحن جميع أجنحة هذا النوع من الطائرات التي تسلمتها إسرائيل منذ مارس/آذار 2022، بما في ذلك 5 طائرات إضافية من المقرر تسليمها بحلول عام 2028.

وتولت الشركة تقريبا جميع عمليات الشحن البحري لمكونات "إف-35" إلى منشأتي الإنتاج الرئيسيتين للطائرة: شركة لوكهيد مارتن (فورت وورث، تكساس) وشركة نورثروب غرومان (بالمديل، كاليفورنيا).

وقد ربطت هذه الشحنات بين موردين في الولايات المتحدة وإسرائيل وإيطاليا وهولندا والنرويج وتركيا وكندا وفرنسا والمملكة المتحدة، وأحيانا في انتهاك لقوانين التصدير الخاصة بتلك الدول.

كما تسهّل ميرسك شحنات لصالح كل من الصناعات الجوية الإسرائيلية (آي إيه آي) وشركة ليوناردو، وهما من كبار المتعاقدين العسكريين في مجال التصنيع العسكري وتشمل تصنيع أجنحة "إف-35" وأنظمة الحرب الإلكترونية.

وتولّت ميرسك شحن ما لا يقل عن 310 مجموعات من أجنحة "إف-35" بين عامي 2019 و2024، وهو عدد كافٍ لتجهيز نصف إجمالي الطائرات التي تم تسليمها عالميا في تلك الفترة ويبلغ عددها 611، من بينها 18 طائرة من طراز "إف-35 آي" تم تسليمها لإسرائيل.

شحنات دون حصر

وتظهر البيانات أن ميرسك ساهمت بين 30 ديسمبر/كانون الأول 2019 و28 يناير/كانون الثاني 2025، فيما لا يقل عن 1009 شحنات بلغ مجموع وزنها أكثر من 15.1 مليون رطل من المعدات العسكرية المرتبطة بسلاسل التوريد العالمية لطائرات "إف-35″، وتشمل هذه الشحنات، دون حصر:

إعلان

404 شحنات من أجنحة الطائرات ومكوناتها وأرسلت إلى شركة لوكهيد مارتن لأغراض التصنيع والإصلاح، بما في ذلك شحنات بطاريات تم تسليمها من قاعدة نفاتيم الجوية في إسرائيل.

459 شحنة من هياكل الطائرات المركزية ومكونات الطيران والإلكترونيات إلى شركة نورثروب غرومان لإنتاج الطائرات.

157 شحنة من حاويات شحن الأجنحة، والأجنحة، وهياكل الطائرات المركزية، وقطع الغيار إلى الشركات المصنعة للأجنحة في إيطاليا وإسرائيل من شركة لوكهيد مارتن.

شحنتان من عربات تحميل الذخائر التي تُستخدم لتسليح هذه الطائرات، وتم تسليمهما مباشرة إلى شركة إلبيت سيستمز الإسرائيلية.

شحنات من أجهزة تحليل السطوح اللازمة لصيانة الطائرات، بما في ذلك عمليات تسليم مباشرة إلى القواعد الجوية الإسرائيلية.

ومن دون هذه الشحنات، لن تتمكن طائرة "إف-35" بالقيام بمهامها التنفيذية سواء تخزين الوقود، أو تشغيل أنظمة التحكم بالطيران، أو التزود بالوقود جوا، أو فتح باب المدفع وتحميل القنابل وإسقاطها، مما يسلط الضوء على الدور الحيوي الذي تؤديه هذه الشحنات في سلسلة توريد الأسلحة التي تدعم جيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي.

حرب الإبادة مجرد تجربة لهذه الطائرة

يعد هذا النوع من الطائرات الحربية "إف-35" العنصر الأساسي في تنفيذ حرب الإبادة الإسرائيلية على غزة، فقد نفذ سلاح الجو الإسرائيلي عددا غير مسبوق من الضربات الجوية على القطاع، معتمدا بشكل كبير على طائرات "إف-35″، مما أسفر عن تدمير مدارس ومستشفيات ودور عبادة، واستشهاد عشرات الآلاف من النساء والأطفال.

وكان المدير التنفيذي لبرنامج "إف-35" مايكل شميت أعلن -خلال جلسة استماع للجنة فرعية في مجلس النواب الأميركي في ديسمبر/كانون الأول 2023- أنه منذ أوائل أكتوبر/تشرين الأول من العام نفسه قدّم البرنامج دعما معززا لإسرائيل.

وقال إن "المستخدمين الإسرائيليين يحققون معدلات أداء ميداني استثنائية، وإن الطائرة تُثبت قدرتها على الصمود، نحن نتعلم كثيرا من هذه التجربة، وسنُطبّق الدروس المستفادة لتعزيز جاهزية الأسطول في جميع أنحاء العالم".

إعلان

وتتميّز طائرة "إف-35" بقدرتها على حمل مجموعة واسعة من الأسلحة، بما في ذلك عديد من الذخائر التي تُستخدم بشكل متكرر في العدوان الإسرائيلي على غزة.

وتشمل حمولة الطائرة جميع أنواع قنابل سلسلة "إم كيه 80" الموجهة وغير الموجهة، وتشكل هذه القنابل غالبية الذخائر التي أُسقطت على قطاع غزة.

وحسب بحث أجرته منظمة دان ووتش الدانماركية غير الحكومية، فقد استُخدمت هذه القنابل لاستهداف خيام النازحين الفلسطينيين في قطاع غزة.

1500 مورد

يعتمد برنامج تصنيع "إف-35" المتعدد الجنسيات في إنتاجه على شبكة إمداد عالمية تضم أكثر من 1400 مورّد داخل الولايات المتحدة، وأكثر من 100 مورّد في دول أخرى حول العالم.

وتسهم هذه الشبكة العالمية بنسبة 70% من التكلفة الإجمالية لطائرة "إف-35" المقاتلة، مما يبرز حجم العمليات اللوجستية الهائلة التي يتطلبها استمرار هذا البرنامج.

وتصل المكونات القادمة من المورّدين الدوليين عبر الجو، كما هي الحال مع قطع الطائرات التي تُشحن من بريطانيا، أو عبر البحر، ويُسلّط هذا الضوء على الدور المحوري الذي تؤديه شركة ميرسك في تسهيل هذه العمليات اللوجستية.

نسخة إسرائيلية معدلة

تعتبر إسرائيل الدولة الوحيدة ضمن البرنامج التي تمتلك نسخة خاصة بها من الطائرة، تُعرف باسم "إف-35 أدير"، كما تملك عقدًا نشطًا لا تزال بموجبه تنتظر تسلّم 5 طائرات من أصل 50 طائرة تم التعاقد عليها في الأصل.

كما وقّعت إسرائيل اتفاقًا في يونيو/حزيران 2024 لشراء 25 طائرة إضافية، على أن تبدأ أولى عمليات التسليم عام 2028.

وبهذا، فإن عمليات تسليم هذا النوع من الطائرات لإسرائيل مستمرة، وآخرها جرت في أبريل/نيسان 2025، وتصل الطائرات المكتملة عبر الجو على شكل دفعات تضم طائرتين أو 3 طائرات، بدعم من قيادة النقل الجوي التابعة لسلاح الجو الأميركي.

وتُموَّل مشتريات إسرائيل من طائرات "إف-35" وغيرها من المعدات العسكرية من خلال برنامج التمويل العسكري الخارجي للولايات المتحدة، الذي أُسس بموجب مذكرة التفاهم بين الحكومتين الأميركية والإسرائيلية، ويتم تجديده كل 10 سنوات، وتمنح الصيغة الحالية من المذكرة إسرائيل 3.3 مليارات دولار سنويا من التمويل العسكري الخارجي، مما يجعلها أكبر مستفيد من هذا البرنامج على مستوى العالم.

إعلان

وبحلول أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2023، كانت هناك 599 صفقة مبيعات عسكرية أجنبية مفتوحة مع إسرائيل، وفي أغسطس/آب 2024، وافقت الولايات المتحدة على صفقات إضافية مع إسرائيل بقيمة 20.3 مليار دولار، شملت بيع طائرات مقاتلة من هذا الطراز بما فيها النسخة الإسرائيلية، وصواريخ، ومعدات عسكرية أخرى.

شحنات ميرسك إلى شركة لوكهيد مارتن

وبحسب التقرير الذي أعدته حركة الشباب الفلسطيني لفهم الدور الرئيسي الذي تؤديه شركة ميرسك في سلسلة التوريد الخاصة بطائرات "إف-35″، فقد جرى تحليل بيانات بوالص الشحن المتعلقة بالشحنات التي تعاملت معها ميرسك نيابة عن شركة لوكهيد مارتن للطيران، التي تعد من المواقع الأساسية لتجميع الطائرات المقاتلة، التي تُستخدم على نطاق واسع من قبل جيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي.

تُعد منشأة فورت وورث واحدة من 3 منشآت فقط على مستوى العالم مخصصة لمرحلة التجميع النهائي والفحص للطائرات المقاتلة إلى جانب منشأتين أخريين في كاميري بإيطاليا وناغويا في اليابان.

وفي عام 2017، نقلت شركة لوكهيد مارتن إنتاج طائرات "إف-16" من منشأة فورت وورث إلى غرينفيل بولاية ساوث كارولينا لإفساح المجال لتوسيع عمليات إنتاج طائرات "إف-35".

تمت دراسة جميع الواردات إلى شركة لوكهيد مارتن للطيران في فورت وورث منذ 30 ديسمبر/كانون الأول 2019، وأظهرت النتائج ما يلي: من بين 501 شحنة واردة، كانت ميرسك مسؤولة عن 404 شحنات منها، وجميعها مرتبطة ببرنامج "إف-35".

وقد شملت هذه الشحنات أكثر من 10.5 ملايين رطل من أجنحة الطائرات، وأجزاء الطائرات، والمكونات الخاصة بهذا النوع من الطائرات، وتم تسليمها إلى لوكهيد مارتن في فورت وورث.

ميرسك وصناعات الفضاء الجوية الإسرائيلية

تُعد شركة صناعات الفضاء الجوية الإسرائيلية (آي إيه آي) من أبرز الشركات الإسرائيلية العاملة في مجال تصنيع الطيران والفضاء، ولها دور كبير في سلسلة توريد طائرات "إف-35″، وقد تورطت -حسب تقارير سابقة- في تصدير منتجات من المستوطنات الإسرائيلية.

إعلان

وورد اسم هذه الشركة الإسرائيلية في تقرير حمل عنوان "ميرسك ودورها في تسهيل الصادرات من المستوطنات الإسرائيلية غير القانونية إلى الولايات المتحدة" الصادر بتاريخ 23 يناير/كانون الثاني 2025.

تُعد "آي إيه آي" واحدة من بين 3 موردين لأجنحة طائرات "إف-35" إلى جانب شركة ليوناردو في مدينة كاميري بإيطاليا، وشركة لوكهيد مارتن في فورت وورث بولاية تكساس، وتُشكل القطع التي تنتجها جزءا من سلسلة الإمداد العالمية، التي تعود في نهاية المطاف إلى إسرائيل على شكل طائرات "إف-35 أدير".

وحسب شركة لوكهيد مارتن، فإن طائرات "إف-35 أدير" تتضمن تحسينات على النسخة القياسية "إف-35 إيه" في 3 مجالات: القيادة والسيطرة والاتصالات والحواسيب والاستخبارات "سي 4 آي" (C4I)، والحرب الإلكترونية، ودمج الأسلحة. وتتعاون لوكهيد مارتن مع قسم "لاهاف" التابع لشركة "آي إيه آي" في تطوير تعديلات "سي 4 آي".

وتؤكد النتائج التي توصلت إليها الحركة -حسب تقريرها- أن ميرسك شحنت ما لا يقل عن 174 شحنة من شركة "آي إيه آي" إلى شركة لوكهيد مارتن للطيران في فورت وورث منذ 30 ديسمبر/كانون الأول 2019، وقد انطلقت هذه الشحنات من مطار بن غوريون أو من المنطقة الصناعية المحاذية له، حيث تقع المنشأة الرئيسية لشركة "آي إيه آي" والمرفق الشرقي التابع لها.

ومن بين 174 شحنة، احتوت 171 شحنة على أزواج من صناديق الأجنحة الخارجية، وكل زوج مرتبط بطائرة "إف-35" معينة من خلال رقم المُصنّع، وفي بوالص الشحن، أُخفي محتوى 159 من هذه الشحنات ووُصفت ببساطة على أنها "قطع غيار طائرات".

وتثبت البيانات والجداول التي قدمتها الحركة في تقريرها أن جميع شحنات صناديق الأجنحة الخارجية التي شُحنت من قبل شركة لوكهيد مارتن إسرائيل كان مصدرها شركة صناعات الفضاء الجوية الإسرائيلية، إذ لا تمتلك لوكهيد مارتن إسرائيل منشآت لإنتاج صناديق الأجنحة.

شركات برنامج تصنيع "إف-35"

وبالإضافة إلى تعاون شركة ميرسك مع شركة لوكهيد مارتن وشركة صناعات الفضاء الجوية الإسرائيلية، فقد قدم التقرير تفصيلا عميقا لتعاون شركة ميرسك مع كل من شركة ليوناردو الإيطالية وشركة لوكهيد مارتن غلوبال، وشركة ميشلان لصناعة الإطارات والصناعات الجوية التركية، وكلها شركات لها علاقة ببرنامج تصنيع المقاتلة المعقدة "إف-35".

إعلان

كما يقدم التقرير بيانات عن عمليات شحن الذخائر التي قامت بها شركة ميرسك من شركة "يو إس أدفانست سيستمز إل إل سي" الواقعة في توينسبورغ بولاية أوهايو، إلى مصنع شركة إلبيت سيستمز، وإلى منشأة صناعات الجيش الإسرائيلي في رمات هشارون.

ويُستخدم نظام التحميل "بي إل-1" (BL-1) لتحميل الذخائر على طائرات "إف-35″، ويُذكر في موقع الشركة الأميركية المصنعة أن هذا النظام هو المفضل لدى سلاح الجو الإسرائيلي لاستخدامه مع طائرات "إف-35″، ومن خلال شحن هذه الأنظمة إلى شريك وثيق لسلاح الجو الإسرائيلي، تُمكّن شركة ميرسك جيش الاحتلال من تنفيذ ضربات جوية باستخدام طائرات "إف-35".

عنصر رئيسي في دعم حرب الإبادة

وفي خاتمة التقرير، يقول معدوه إنه يقدم أدلة لا يمكن إنكارها أن شركة ميرسك ليست مجرد ناقل سلبي للبضائع، بل هي عنصر رئيسي في دعم المجمع العسكري الصناعي الإسرائيلي.

بينما كشفت تقارير سابقة عن دور ميرسك في نقل الأسلحة وتصدير منتجات المستوطنات، يكشف هذا التقرير بعدا آخر من تورط ميرسك، إذ تعمل بوصفها حلقة بحرية حاسمة لنقل المكونات العسكرية المستخدمة في تصنيع وصيانة مقاتلات تُستخدم في العدوان الإسرائيلي المتواصل على غزة.

وتظهر نتائج التقرير أن ميرسك مسؤولة عن نقل مكونات أساسية لوظائف حيوية في الطائرة "إف-35″، مثل تشغيل المحركات، وتخزين الوقود، وإعادة التزود بالوقود في أثناء الطيران، والهبوط الاضطراري، والملاحة في أثناء الطيران، والاتصال مع الطائرات الأخرى، وفتح باب المدفع، وتحميل القنابل، وإسقاطها.

ويوضح التقرير أن ميرسك ستظل مسؤولة عن نقل الأجنحة والمكونات الحيوية الأخرى لهذه الطائرات، وبذلك، تواصل دورها في دعم حرب الإبادة، فقد تسلمت إسرائيل 3 طائرات "إف-35" منتصف مارس/آذار 2025 وأعلنت وصولها في 16 مارس/آذار، قبل يومين من شن هذه الطائرات غارات جوية منسقة على غزة، أودت بحياة أكثر من 400 فلسطيني وبذلك أنهت الهدنة التي كانت قائمة.

إعلان

في وقت نشر هذا التقرير، وقعت ميرسك عقودا جديدة على أن تكون رابطا أساسيا لنقل الأسلحة والمكونات الحربية التي ستزيد من الترسانة القاتلة لجيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي.

كشف تحقيق لصحيفة "هآرتس" الإسرائيلية أن جيش الاحتلال أطلق العنان في عمليته العسكرية الحالية لسلسلة هجمات على المراكز الطبية في قطاع غزة.

وذكر تحقيق الصحيفة الذي نشرته أمس السبت أن 10 مستشفيات وعيادات طبية في غزة تعرضت لهجمات إسرائيلية خلال الأسبوع الماضي، وخرجت كليا أو جزئيا عن الخدمة، مما فاقم بشكل كبير الضغط على ما تبقى من النظام الصحي في غزة.

وبحسب الصحيفة، فإن الهجوم الذي وقع الأسبوع الماضي على المستشفى الأوروبي في مدينة خان يونس جنوبي غزة شكل نقطة البداية لتوسيع العملية العسكرية في القطاع التي تحولت إلى "عملية عربات جدعون"، والتي تبعها إطلاق موجة من الهجمات المكثفة على مراكز طبية أخرى في أنحاء القطاع.

وأشارت الصحيفة إلى أن منظمة الصحة العالمية أحصت 28 هجوما على مستشفيات القطاع خلال الأسبوع الأخير، بما يشكل 4% من مجمل الهجمات على المستشفيات منذ بداية الحرب.

وبحسب "هآرتس"، فإن وزارة الصحة في غزة تقول إن هناك الآن نحو 400 ألف شخص من دون أي خدمات طبية متاحة، وأكدت أن الجيش الإسرائيلي يواصل مزاعمه بأن مسلحي حركة حماس ما زالوا يختبئون داخل مستشفيات القطاع.

وأعلنت منظمة الصحة العالمية أول أمس الجمعة أن الهجمات الإسرائيلية المستمرة على قطاع غزة المحاصر منذ سنوات دفعت النظام الصحي نحو الانهيار.

إعلان

وفي بيان نشرته عبر حسابها على منصة "إكس"، قالت المنظمة إن الهجمات العسكرية المكثفة في غزة تدفع النظام الصحي نحو الانهيار.

وأشارت إلى أن 94% على الأقل من مستشفيات القطاع تعرضت لأضرار جسيمة أو دُمرت بالكامل.

وذكرت المنظمة أن 19 فقط من أصل 36 مستشفى في غزة لا تزال تعمل ولو بشكل جزئي. وأكدت أن المستشفيات لا ينبغي أبدا عسكرتها أو استهدافها.

ولفتت الصحة العالمية إلى أن 4 مستشفيات رئيسية أُجبرت على الإغلاق خلال الأسبوع الماضي، نتيجة للهجمات المتكررة، وأوامر الإخلاء، وتصاعد وتيرة الهجمات.

ومنذ بدئه حرب الإبادة على القطاع في 7 أكتوبر/تشرين أول 2023، عمد الجيش الإسرائيلي إلى استهداف مستشفيات غزة ومنظومتها الصحية، وأخرج معظمها عن الخدمة، مما عرّض حياة المرضى والجرحى للخطر، حسب بيانات فلسطينية وأممية.

ومنذ 2 مارس/آذار الماضي، تواصل إسرائيل سياسة تجويع ممنهج لنحو 2.4 مليون فلسطيني بغزة، عبر إغلاق المعابر بوجه المساعدات المتكدسة على الحدود، مما أدخل القطاع مرحلة المجاعة وأودى بحياة كثيرين.

وبدعم أميركي، ترتكب إسرائيل منذ 7 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2023 جرائم إبادة جماعية في غزة، خلّفت أكثر من 176 ألف فلسطيني بين شهيد وجريح معظمهم أطفال ونساء، وما يزيد على 11 ألف مفقود، بجانب مئات الآلاف من النازحين.

أفاد مراسل الجزيرة باستشهاد 3 فلسطينيين وإصابة وفقدان آخرين في قصف إسرائيلي فجر اليوم على منزل في منطقة جباليا النزلة شمالي قطاع غزة.

وفي خان يونس جنوبا، قال المراسل إن قصفا مدفعيا إسرائيليا تزامن مع إطلاق نار مكثف من الدبابات استهدف وسط بلدة القرارة شمالي المدينة.

وأفاد المراسل باستشهاد فلسطيني وإصابة آخرين في قصف استهدف خيمة تؤوي نازحين في منطقة المواصي غرب خان يونس.

وفي وقت سابق أمس السبت، أفاد مراسل الجزيرة بأن 6 فلسطينيين استشهدوا، وأصيب آخرون، في غارتين إسرائيليتين استهدفتا حي التفاح، شرقي مدينة غزة.

كما أفاد المراسل بإصابة فلسطيني بنيران مسيرة إسرائيلية في أثناء بحثه عن الغذاء في منطقة الصفطاوي شمال غربي مدينة غزة.

في هذه الأثناء، قالت وزارة الصحة في غزة إن 48 فلسطينيا استشهدوا منذ فجر السبت.

وبدعم أميركي، ترتكب إسرائيل منذ السابع من أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2023 جرائم إبادة جماعية في غزة خلّفت أكثر من 175 ألف فلسطيني بين شهيد وجريح -معظمهم أطفال ونساء- وما يزيد على 11 ألف مفقود، إلى جانب مئات آلاف النازحين.

في قطاع غزة، لا يُستثنى أحد من لهيب الحرب الإسرائيلية، لا المدنيون، ولا الأطفال، ولا حتى الأطباء الذين نذروا حياتهم لإنقاذ الأرواح. وفي واحدة من أكثر القصص إيلاما، نجد الدكتورة آلاء النجار، طبيبة الأطفال تصبح فجأة ضحية فقد صعب جدا.

في لحظة واحدة، انقلبت الموازين، ودخلت الطبيبة إلى غرفة الطوارئ، ليس كمنقذة، بل كأم مكلومة تواجه مشهدا قاسيا، جثامين أطفالها، أشلاء متفحمة، بين أيدي زملائها، في أروقة الطوارئ التي اعتادت أن تمنح فيها الحياة.

من جهته، روى المدير العام لوزارة الصحة في غزة الدكتور منير البرش تفاصيل المأساة قائلا: "الدكتورة آلاء لديها 10 أبناء، أكبرهم لم يتجاوز 12 عاما. في صباح المأساة، خرجت مع زوجها الدكتور حمدي النجار ليوصلها إلى عملها، وبعد دقائق فقط من عودته، سقط صاروخ إسرائيلي على منزلهم".

وأضاف عبر حسابه في منصة "إكس":"استُشهد تسعة من أطفالهما: يحيى، ركان، رسلان، جبران، إيف، ريفان، سيدين، لقمان، وسيدرا. أُصيب الطفل الوحيد المتبقي، آدم، كما أُصيب زوجها الدكتور حمدي، الذي يرقد حاليا في العناية المركزة".

وأكد البرش أن ما حدث يُجسّد الواقع المرير الذي يعيشه الكادر الطبي في غزة، قائلا: "الكلمات لا تكفي لوصف الألم. الاحتلال لا يكتفي باستهداف الأطباء، بل يُمعن في الإجرام ويستهدف عائلاتهم بأكملها".

لاقت قصة الدكتورة آلاء النجار، اختصاصية الأطفال في مستشفى التحرير بمجمع ناصر الطبي، حزنا عميقا لدى مغرّدين فلسطينيين وعرب عبر منصات التواصل الاجتماعي، إذ اعتبروا أن قصتها ليست مشهدا من فيلم مأساوي، بل واقع مرّ يتكرر كل يوم في غزة، حيث لا مكان آمنا، ولا استثناء لبراءة أو مهنة.

وفي سياق الفاجعة التي هزّت قطاع غزة، عبّر الأكاديمي والكاتب الفلسطيني فايز أبو شمالة عبر منصة "إكس"، بكلمات تحاكي الوجع واللا منطق:"في غزة، أشياء لا يصدقها العقل، وحوادث خارقة لقوانين الطبيعة".

وأشار إلى أن الدكتورة آلاء النجار، وبعد سنوات طوال من التربية والرعاية والتوجيه، فقدت أبناءها في غارة إسرائيلية واحدة، وهي التي اختارت لهم أسماء مميزة، بحبّ الأم وأمل المستقبل، دون أن يخطر ببالها أنها ستفقدهم جميعا بضغطة زر على صاروخ أطلقته مجندة إسرائيلية جاءت من أوكرانيا.

بدوره، قال الناشط الفلسطيني أحمد حجازي: "بعد ارتقاء يقين، وصمت ضحكات أطفال الدكتورة آلاء النجار، لم يعد للعدد معنى… أكثر من 18 ألف طفل، اسم فوق اسم، ضحكة انطفأت، حلم تكسّر تحت الركام".

بينما أشار مغردون إلى أن ما حدث ليس مجرد مأساة شخصية، بل نداء إنساني صارخ في وجه العالم، يُذكّر بأن الحروب ليست فقط نزاعات مسلحة، بل مآسٍ تحرق أحلام الأمهات وتقتل الطفولة وتختبر ما تبقّى من ضمير في هذا العالم.

واعتبر آخرون أن ما حصل مع الدكتورة آلاء النجار يختزل معنى الإبادة في قطاع غزة، المستمرة منذ ما يقارب 20 شهرا. وتساءلوا: "كيف للإنسان أن يواصل حياته بعقله بعد كل هذا؟".

وكتب أحد المغردين: "هل هناك عقل بشري يستوعب أن ترى 8 من أطفالك أشلاء متفحمة؟".

أي وجع يفوق أن تمارس الطب لتنقذ الآخرين بينما يعجز العالم عن إنقاذ حياة أطفالك؟ — حــفــيــدة الــتــاريــخ الــغــز ا و يـــة 𓂆 (@Bostanaaa) May 23, 2025

وتساءل آخرون: "أي وجع يفوق أن تمارس الطب لإنقاذ الآخرين، بينما يعجز العالم عن إنقاذ حياة أطفالك؟ أي قلب سيحتمل كل هذا القهر؟".

بالرغم من الصورة التي تحاول حكومة نتنياهو إظهارها أمام العالَم باعتبارها حكومة موحدة ومتماسكة، فإنه لا يخفى على مُطّلع هشاشةُ هذه الحكومة، إلى درجة جعلت صمودَها حتى اليوم أمرًا غير مألوف.

وبالرغم من أن عنوان إسقاط الحكومة الذي يتوقعه أغلب المراقبين، هو وقف الحرب الشعواء التي تشنها إسرائيل على الشعب الفلسطيني في قطاع غزة، والذي سينتج عنه بالضرورة انسحاب الثنائي سموتريتش وبن غفير أو أحدهما من الحكومة والعمل على إسقاطها، فإن النظرة الأوسع إلى طبيعة التركيبة التي تتكون منها هذه الحكومة تكشف للمراقبين لاعبًا خطيرًا يمكن أن يكون القشة التي تقصم ظهر الائتلاف الحكومي في إسرائيل، بل وتزعزع التماسك الهش في الشارع الإسرائيلي برمته، وهذا اللاعب هو "الأحزاب الحريدية".

الحريديون في إسرائيل هم التيار الديني التقليدي الذي يعتبر أن وجود هذه الدولة مرتبط بشكل أساسي بمدى التزامها بأحكام التوراة، وهؤلاء يشكلون نسبة ليست هينة في المجتمع الإسرائيلي، تزيد على 13٪ من المجموع الكلي للسكان الذي يتضمن الدروز وفلسطينيي الداخل.

أما نسبتهم إلى مجموع اليهود البالغ عددهم 7 ملايين شخص في إسرائيل فتصل إلى 17٪، وذلك بعد أن كانت نسبتهم غداة النكبة الفلسطينية وإنشاء دولة الاحتلال لا تتجاوز 2.6٪. وترى دائرة الإحصاء الإسرائيلية أنهم مرشحون للوصول لنسبة 35٪ بحلول عام 2059.

إعلان

هذه النسبة المرتفعة تتناسب حاليًا مع تمثيلهم في الكنيست، حيث يسيطرون على 18 مقعدًا من أصل 120 بنسبة تصل إلى 15٪ من مجموع المقاعد. ويأتي حزب (شاس) في مقدمة الأحزاب الحريدية في الكنيست حيث يسيطر على 11 مقعدًا، يليه حزب (يهدوت هتوراه) الحريدي الذي يشغل 7 مقاعد.

بحسبة بسيطة، يتبين أن حكومة نتنياهو تستند إلى أغلبية هشة لا تتجاوز أربعة مقاعد، إذ يحوز ائتلافه 64 مقعدًا فحسب، من أصل 120؛ منها 32 لحزب الليكود، و14 لتحالف الصهيونية الدينية بزعامة سموتريتش وبن غفير، بينما تستحوذ الأحزاب الحريدية على ما تبقى.

وبينما نجد أن معظم الأصوات المطالِبة بإسقاط الحكومة تنبع من معسكر الصهيونية الدينية، مركِّزة على ضرورة استمرار الحرب في غزة ومنع دخول المساعدات الإنسانية، فإن الأحزاب الحريدية تتبنى ملفًا مختلفًا تمامًا، ألا وهو تجنيد الحريديم في الجيش الإسرائيلي، وهو بالنسبة لها القضية المحورية التي قد تدفعها إلى الانسحاب من الائتلاف. لكنها، على خلاف شركائها، لا ترفع صوتها بالتهديد ولا تلوِّح بالانسحاب كل حين، كما يفعل بن غفير وسموتريتش يوميًا تقريبًا.

تجنيد الحريديم ملفٌّ أساسي تعيش إسرائيل أزمته منذ عقود، حيث بدأت عادة إعفائهم من الخدمة العسكرية منذ زمن ديفيد بن غوريون أول رئيس وزراء لإسرائيل، الذي أعفى 400 مهاجر من الحريديم من التجنيد الإجباري في الجيش، لعدة اعتبارات، كان منها أنهم لم يشكلوا نسبة كبيرة من السكان في ذلك الوقت كما أسلفنا، إضافة إلى رغبته في كسب ود تيارات التفسيرات التقليدية الدينية التي كانت تتردد في دعم فكرة قيام دولة لليهود آنذاك، حيث قطع لهم تعهدًا بأن تحترم إسرائيل التقاليد الدينية اليهودية.

كما كان يرغب في تأكيد صورة إسرائيل باعتبارها دولة يهودية بما يمكن أن يقنع أطيافًا مختلفة من اليهود في العالم للهجرة إليها.

إعلان

وكان سبب إصرار الحريديم على الإعفاء من التجنيد في الجيش، أنه يتعارض مع مبادئهم، حيث يرون أن وظيفتهم في الدنيا هي قراءة التوراة وتفسيرها، وهم يؤمنون بأن هذا العمل مقدس وعظيم لدرجة الإيمان بأنه سبب استمرار الحياة على كوكب الأرض، فهم يرون في تدارس التوراة مهمة ربانية لخدمة العالَم كله والحفاظ عليه من الدمار!

وهذا يعني أن هذه الفئة لا ترى لدولة الاحتلال فضلًا عليها في شيء، بل إنها ترى أن لها الفضل في استمرار الحياة في دولة الاحتلال ونجاة جيشها في حروبه، ولا سيما في هذه الحرب.

وهو ما أشار له الحاخام الأكبر لطائفة السفارديم الشرقيين يتسحاق يوسف في تصريحه الشهير: "من دون المدارس الدينية لم يكن الجيش لينجح، فالجنود لم ينجحوا إلا بفضل أهل التوراة". وهذا الحاخام نفسه هو الذي هدد بمغادرة أبناء طائفته جميعًا دولة الاحتلال إلى غير رجعة في حال فرض التجنيد الإجباري عليهم.

أتباع التيار الحريدي كانوا قد استفادوا كثيرًا من وصول الليكود للحكم في إسرائيل، ذلك أن الليكود كان دائمًا حريصًا على إرضائهم؛ كسبًا لدعمهم في الانتخابات وتشكيل حكوماته المتعاقبة، ولم يكونوا يشكلون له أية أزمة باعتبار أن طلباتهم في العادة لا تتجاوز الحفاظ على ميزانيات المدارس الدينية والالتزام ببقاء إعفائهم من التجنيد الإجباري الذي يعتبر من صميم متطلباتهم الدائمة من أية حكومة.

يعتبر هؤلاء الحريديون أن دخول الجيش يمكن أن يؤثر في عقيدتهم، لأنهم لا يرون في العلمانيين الإسرائيليين أكثر من مجموعة من مجموعة من الكفار الذين يتكلمون العبرية، فهم يحتقرونهم، وبدا ذلك في أكثر من موقف، منها على سبيل المثال ما فعله وزير الإسكان في حكومة نتنياهو عن حزب "يهدوت هتوراه" يتسحاق غولدكنوبف، الذي أشعل أزمة العام الماضي عندما ظهر في فيديو يرقص مع عدد من أنصاره وهم يهتفون "نموت ولا نتجند، ولا نقبل بحكم الكفار" في إشارة إلى العلمانيين في دولة الاحتلال.

إعلان

وكان اليمين في إسرائيل قد نجح في عام 2015 في تمرير قانون في الكنيست يعفي الحريديم من التجنيد الإجباري في الجيش، ولكن المحكمة العليا تدخلت وألغت هذا القانون تحت بند المساواة، وأمرت بإيجاد تشريع لا يتضمن إعفاء الحريديم، وكانت تلك بداية الأزمة الفعلية التي تفاقمت في ظل المعركة الحالية التي أتعبت جيش الاحتلال واضطرته لاستدعاء الاحتياط لتعويض النقص الحاد في الجنود.

وبالرغم من ذلك لم تُحل المشكلة، مما أدى إلى تصاعد الأصوات العلمانية القومية التي تطالب بتجنيد الحريديم إجباريًا كما نص قرار المحكمة العليا.

وبما أن غالبية الأصوات المنادية بتجنيد الحريديم، هم من العلمانيين يسارًا ويمينًا، فإن الأحزاب الحريدية عادت لتراها وكأنها معركة بين أنصار التوراة وأنصار الهرطقة، أو بين النور والظلام، وبالتالي تتصاعد صيحات الاستهجان لديهم؛ رفضًا للانصياع لرأي هؤلاء الذين يريدون منهم ترك دراسة التوراة والاختلاط بهم في الجيش بما يؤدي لنسيان التوراة والانحراف عن الشريعة.

في المقابل، تتصاعد بين العلمانيين سواء من اليساريين أو القوميين اليمينيين في إسرائيل دعوات الضغط على الحريديم للتجنيد أسوة بغيرهم. وحجتهم هي عدم منطقية أن يدفع الجنود حياتهم ثمنًا للدفاع عن مجموعة من المتدينين الذين لا يقدمون شيئًا للمجتمع ولا يدافعون عنه، بل ويحتقرونه. وهذا الانقسام الذي نزل إلى الشارع ينذر الآن بمزيد من التشظي لدى المجتمع الإسرائيلي نفسه.

للحق، فإن الطبيعة الحادة لتصريحات قادة الحريديم هي التي تزيد الهوة اتساعًا بين الطرفين، فإعلان أن "الموت على يد العرب خير من التجنيد في الجيش"، وأنه "من الأفضل أكل لحم الخنزير على الوجود في مجتمع علماني وفكر علماني"، وإعلان بعض رموزهم أنه "لا يوجد ثقافة مشتركة بين الإسرائيليين العلمانيين والحريديم"، إلى غير ذلك من التصريحات التي تنقلها وسائل الإعلام الإسرائيلية من حين لآخر، كل هذا يشي بأنه لا يوجد أرضية مشتركة بين الحريديم والعلمانيين على اختلاف مشاربهم وأفكارهم. وهذا يعني أن الأزمة التي تتصاعد حاليًا بين الطرفين تنذر بأن تتوسع في الشارع ولا تكتفي فقط بأن تكون في أروقة الحكومة والكنيست.

إعلان

إذن، فأزمة الحريديم بعيدة عن الحل في ظل النظرة الاستعلائية التي ينظر بها كل طرف إلى الآخر، وهي مرشحة للتفاقم في الفترة القادمة، فالجيش يحتاج أوامر التجنيد الإجبارية، ونتنياهو يواجه عقبات من داخل ائتلافه ضد فكرة تشريع قانون يعفي الحريديم من الخدمة الإلزامية في الجيش، استجابة لمطالب حزبي شاس ويهدوت هتوراه في ظل معارضة المحكمة العليا، ومعارضة الغالبية العظمى من الشارع الإسرائيلي (70٪) لهذا الإعفاء.

السؤال المطروح هنا: إلى أي مدىً يمكن أن تتسع أزمة الحريديم؟

إن الغالبية العظمى من آراء المحللين في هذا الشأن تقف في إجابة هذا السؤال عند احتمالية إسقاط حكومة نتنياهو في حال انسحاب الحريديم منها، ولكني أرى أن هناك أبعادًا أعمق بكثير من مجرد إسقاط حكومة نتنياهو.

فالشارع الإسرائيلي لم يكن يومًا منقسمًا على نفسه كما هو اليوم. وفي الوقت الذي يهاجم فيه المنضوون تحت ألوية جيش الاحتلال طلبةَ المدارس الدينية الحريدية بزعم أن الجنود ليسوا ملزمين بالتضحية بدمائهم لأجل حفنة من الطلبة الذين لا يعملون شيئًا غير الدراسة والحديث في الأحكام الفقهية، فإن الحريديم يُصَعِّدون لهجتهم ضد نظام الدولة بالكامل، ويتكلمون بوضوح عن ضلال المجتمع الإسرائيلي من خارج الحريديم، أي ضلال أكثر من 80٪ من سكان هذه الدولة من اليهود لا من العرب!

وبالتالي فإن الرفض المتبادل يمكن أن يؤدي فعليًا إلى الاشتباك في الشارع واندلاع أعمال عنف من شأنها أن تؤدي إلى اضطرابات أكبر بكثير من كل ما يتخيله الطرفان.

عندما يهدد زعيم السفارديم بمغادرة البلاد فإنه يعلن بذلك كفره بالمواطنة الإسرائيلية وبفكرة الوطن القومي لليهود، وهو بذلك يعلن بوضوح عدم ارتباطه وأتباعه بالمشروع الصهيوني ولا اقتناعهم بإمكانية بقاء الدولة أو حتى الانتماء إليها، وبذلك فإنه يزرع في إسرائيل بذور التفتت والتآكل الداخلي الذي يخشاه المحللون الإسرائيليون جميعًا ويتوقعونه في نفس الوقت.

في واحة نائية شمال غرب المملكة العربية السعودية، وبينما كان فريق من الباحثين ينقب عن آثار حضارة قديمة، لم يتوقع أحد أن تقودهم حفريات صغيرة إلى اكتشاف مذهل يعيد كتابة تاريخ الطب الشعبي في المنطقة.

حيث كشفت دراسة جديدة عن أول دليل موثق على استخدام نبات "الحرمل"، المعروف علميا باسم "بيجانوم هارمالا"، كبخور علاجي ونفسي قبل نحو 2700 عام، أي في العصر الحديدي، لتصبح هذه هي أقدم ممارسة معروفة من نوعها في العالم.

هذا الاكتشاف، الذي نشر في 23 مايو/أيار في مجلة "كوميونيكيشن بيولوجي"، نتج عن تعاون مشترك بين معهد ماكس بلانك لعلوم الإنسان القديم بألمانيا، وجامعة فيينا بالنمسا، وهيئة التراث السعودية.

بخور علاجي في أوان فخارية

تقول قائدة فريق البحث باربرا هوبر -الباحثة المشاركة في علم الكيمياء الآثارية، في معهد ماكس بلانك لدراسة الجيو-أنثروبولوجي- إن الحفريات عثر عليها في موقع مستوطنة قديمة (واحة القرية) تقع في شمال غرب السعودية، وتعرف حاليا بأوانيها المزخرفة التي أطلق عليها علماء الآثار اسم "فخار قرية المصبوغ".

وعثر داخل هذه الأواني على بقايا عضوية دقيقة، فقرر الباحثون فحصها باستخدام تقنية تحليل متطورة تعرف "بالكروماتوغرافيا السائلة عالية الأداء مع مطياف الكتلة الترادفية"، وهي تقنية قادرة على اكتشاف المركبات النباتية حتى في أضعف العينات.

وكانت النتيجة مفاجئة، إذ إن المركبات الكيميائية التي تم اكتشافها تعود لنبات "الحرمل"، المعروف في الطب الشعبي بخصائصه المطهرة، والمضادة للبكتيريا، والمسببة لتأثيرات نفسية ملطفة عند استنشاقه كبخور.

إعلان

وتوضح هوبر في تصريحات للجزيرة نت: "أظهرت تحليلاتنا أن هذه هي أقدم حالة موثقة لاستخدام نبات الحرمل كبخور في الجزيرة العربية، بل في العالم بأسره. هذا ليس مجرد اكتشاف أثري، بل نافذة حقيقية على معارف القدماء بعلم النباتات، وكيف استخدموا الطبيعة لعلاج أنفسهم وتنقية أرواحهم".

تقاليد باقية حتى اليوم

لا يزال الحرمل يستخدم حتى اليوم في بعض المناطق العربية، سواء في الطب الشعبي أو في طقوس تبخير البيوت، ربما لمنع الحسد، أو لتطهير المكان. ويشير هذا الاكتشاف إلى أن تلك الممارسات ليست جديدة، بل تمتد جذورها إلى آلاف السنين.

توضح الباحثة أن دمج التحليل الكيميائي مع علم الآثار سمح بفهم أعمق للثقافات القديمة، إذ إن المعتاد ألا تبقى آثار مثل هذه الممارسات محفوظة، لكن باستخدام تقنيات التحليل الجزيئي تمكن الفريق البحثي من معرفة ليس فقط نوع النبات، بل كيفية استخدامه ومتى ولماذا. هذه المعلومات تعطينا لمحة حقيقية عن الحياة اليومية في العصور القديمة.

يعتقد المؤلفون أن مثل هذه الاكتشافات لا تحافظ فقط على قطع أثرية، بل تعيد إحياء تراث ثقافي غير مادي، وتربط بين المعارف القديمة والممارسات التي ما زال الناس في المنطقة يمارسونها حتى اليوم. كما يفتح هذا الاكتشاف بابا واسعا أمام الباحثين في مجالات متعددة، مثل الأنثروبولوجيا، وعلم الأدوية، والتاريخ الثقافي. فهو لا يكشف فقط عن استخدام نبات معين، بل عن منظومة متكاملة من المعرفة والمعتقدات المرتبطة بالنباتات والروح والصحة.

في عام 2009، تقدم 5 كينيين مسنين بطلب رسمي إلى رئيس الوزراء البريطاني غوردون براون، طالبوا فيه بالاعتراف بالانتهاكات الجسيمة التي تعرضوا لها خلال الحكم الاستعماري البريطاني لكينيا في خمسينيات القرن الماضي.

ورغم ضعف الأدلة المتوفرة في البداية، فقد وصلت القضية إلى المحكمة العليا البريطانية عام 2011، لتكشف عن مفاجأة مدوية، وهي أن بريطانيا تعمدت إخفاء وتدمير آلاف المستندات التي توثق ممارسات قمعية ارتُكبت خلال تلك الحقبة، خشية الإضرار بسمعتها أو فتح الباب أمام مطالبات قانونية قد تؤدي إلى مساءلة تاريخية.

ما بدأ كقضية قانونية محدودة فتح الباب واسعا على تاريخ طويل من القمع الاستعماري الذي مارسته بريطانيا في مختلف أنحاء العالم. فعلى مدار قرون، بسطت الإمبراطورية البريطانية نفوذها على مساحات شاسعة وتركت خلفها إرثا من الظلم والجروح والصراعات لا يزال يلقي بثقله على المشهد العالمي حتى اليوم.

من التجارة إلى الإمبراطورية

بدأت الإمبراطورية بتأسيس شركة الهند الشرقية البريطانية التي سرعان ما تحولت من مشروع تجاري إلى قوة إمبريالية، تخوض الحروب وتفرض سيطرتها على مساحات شاسعة من جنوب آسيا، مما مهد لصعود بريطانيا كقوة عالمية، ومع احتكار التجارة في الهند والصين، عززت بريطانيا نفوذها الاقتصادي والعسكري، واضعة الأسس لإمبراطورية امتدت عبر القارات.

مع دخول القرن الـ19، أصبحت القارة الأفريقية ساحة جديدة لمشاريع بريطانيا الاستعمارية بعد احتلال مصر عام 1882 والسيطرة على قناة السويس، التي ضمنت لبريطانيا هيمنتها على أحد أهم طرق التجارة إلى الهند.

واجه سلوك بريطانيا الاستعمارية في أفريقيا مقاومة شرسة، لا سيما في جنوب القارة، ولكن بحلول أواخر القرن الـ19، كانت بريطانيا قد أحكمت قبضتها على أجزاء واسعة من القارة، محققة رؤيتها بإنشاء إمبراطورية تمتد "من كيب تاون إلى القاهرة"، كما في أدبيات تلك المرحلة.

إعلان

وكانت الإمبراطورية حينها تضم ما يقرب من ربع مساحة اليابسة في العالم وأكثر من ربع مجموع سكانها، ولم تكن هيمنة بريطانيا مقتصرة على الأراضي وحدها، بل امتدت للسيطرة التجارية والسياسية في مناطق إستراتيجية أبرزها الصين.

في الصين، فرضت بريطانيا ما يُعرف بـ"المعاهدات غير المتكافئة" بعد سلسلة من الحروب سميت بحروب الأفيون الأولى والثانية، التي بدأت بسبب قيام بريطانيا بتصدير الأفيون إلى الصين لتعويض العجز التجاري المتزايد لديها بسبب الطلب الكبير على الشاي الصيني.

لكن مع تصاعد التغيرات الجيوسياسية، وظهور قوى دولية منافسة، بدأت هيمنة بريطانيا العالمية بالتآكل التدريجي. وفي محاولة لإعادة صياغة علاقتها بمستعمراتها السابقة، أُعلن عام 1931 عن تشكيل الكومنولث البريطاني، الذي ضم الكيانات التي حازت قدرا واسعا من الحكم الذاتي، لكنها استمرت في الاعتراف الرمزي بالملك البريطاني كقائد لهذا التجمع.

ظلّت هونغ كونغ الشاهد الأخير على التاريخ الاستعماري البريطاني حتى عام 1997، لتسلمها بريطانيا رسميا إلى السيادة الصينية، وتطوي بذلك آخر صفحات إمبراطوريتها المباشرة.

سلسلة طويلة من الانتهاكات

يروج بعضهم لفكرة أن الإمبراطورية البريطانية شكلت استثناء ملحوظا في القاعدة الاستعمارية، استنادا إلى ما يُعرف بـ"النهج الناعم" البريطاني، في إدارة مستعمراتها دون اللجوء إلى الفظائع التي ارتكبتها القوى الاستعمارية الأخرى، غير أن هذا التصور، بحسب عدد من الباحثين والمؤرخين، أدى إلى إضفاء سردية مُجتزأة تُخفي جوانب أساسية من العنف البنيوي الذي ميز التجربة الاستعمارية.

ووفقا لهذا الطرح، تم تقديم السياسات العسكرية البريطانية باعتبارها إجراءات "منضبطة" و"متحضرة"، بل وذات طابع إنساني، في حين جرى تبرير استخدام القوة على أنه ضرورة تهدف إلى فرض النظام بين شعوب توصف بأنها "بدائية" أو "متخلفة".

إعلان

ورغم أن القانون الدولي وضع قواعد تضبط سلوك الدول "المتحضرة" في النزاعات المسلحة، فإن هذه القواعد لم تُطبق في الحروب الاستعمارية التي خاضتها بريطانيا، بل غالبا ما جرى تجاهلها وفق مختصين، مما فتح المجال أمام ارتكاب مجازر واسعة بحق السكان الأصليين تحت غطاء استعادة الأمن أو فرض الهيبة الإمبراطورية.

في عام 1898، ارتكب الجيش البريطاني بقيادة الجنرال هربرت كتشنر مجازر واسعة ضد قوات المهدية السودانية في معركة كرري (أم درمان)، استخدم البريطانيون أسلحة حديثة مثل المدافع الرشاشة والبنادق المتطورة، في حين كان غالبية المقاتلين السودانيين مسلحين بأسلحة بيضاء وأسلحة تقليدية.

فتحت نيران البوارج، واستخدمت القوات البريطانية رشاشات مكسيم المحملة بذخائر "دوم دوم" المتمددة، وكانت القذيفة الواحدة تخلف عشرات القتلى، وهي من أوائل الأسلحة الآلية في التاريخ العسكري الحديث، وفرت هذه الرشاشات كثافة نارية غير مسبوقة، مما جعلها واحدة من أقوى الأسلحة في الحروب الاستعمارية.

تصف المصادر والشهادات المعركة بأنها كانت إبادة جماعية أكثر منها مواجهة عسكرية متكافئة، إذ واصل الجنود البريطانيون إطلاق النار حتى بعد هروب أو استسلام العديد من السودانيين، وأعدموا الجرحى على أرض المعركة. أسفر ذلك عن مقتل ما يقدر بين 10 آلاف إلى 26 ألف مقاتل سوداني في غضون ساعات، بينما لم تتجاوز خسائر البريطانيين 100 قتيل.

وقد أثارت وحشية المجزرة انتقادات واسعة في الصحافة البريطانية في ذلك الوقت، واعتبرها كثيرون رمزا لهمجية الإمبريالية البريطانية واحتقارها لحياة الشعوب المستعمَرة.

ورغم الانتقادات الدولية الواسعة، استمرت بريطانيا في استخدام هذه الذخائر حتى عام 1902، ليس بسبب اعتبارات إنسانية، بل خوفا من أن تُستخدم ضد قواتها من قبل خصومها، بحسب ما ذكره متخصصون.

وفي عام 1919، شهدت الهند واحدة من أسوأ المجازر، حين فتحت القوات البريطانية نيرانها على حشد من المتظاهرين المدنيين في حديقة جاليانوالا باغ بمدينة أمريتسار في إقليم البنجاب، قُتل في ذلك اليوم نحو 400 شخص، وأصيب أكثر من 1000 وفق الأرقام الرسمية، بينما تشير مصادر مستقلة إلى أن الأعداد الحقيقية أكبر بكثير.

إعلان

لم تكتف القوات البريطانية بإطلاق النار، بل منعت أيضا تقديم الإسعافات للمصابين، في خطوة أثارت موجة غضب عالمي.

لم تكن هذه الحادثة سوى واحدة من سلسلة طويلة من الانتهاكات التي ارتكبتها بريطانيا في مستعمراتها، فقد استخدمت السلطات الاستعمارية سياسة الأرض المحروقة في مواجهة أي مظاهر مقاومة، شملت إحراق القرى وتهجير السكان، كوسيلة لفرض السيطرة وإخماد التحركات الشعبية.

وكان أحد أكثر أساليب الإعدام الوحشية التي استخدمها البريطانيون ضد المتمردين في الهند هو تفجير الأسرى من أفواه المدافع، وهو أسلوب دموي تعمّد انتهاك الشعائر الدينية لدى المسلمين والهندوس معا، جعلت من المستحيل دفن أو حرق الجثث وفق الشعائر الدينية، مما أضفى طابعا رمزيا يهدف إلى تحطيم الروح المعنوية والدينية للمجتمعات المُستعمَرة.

ووفقا للمؤرخين الرسميين، شهدت الهند خلال الحكم البريطاني إعلان الأحكام العرفية، حيث كان الجنود والمدنيون البريطانيون يعقدون محاكمات دموية صورية أو يعدمون السكان الأصليين دون أي محاكمة، بغض النظر عن الجنس أو العمر.

وكان ونستون تشرشل وزيرا للدولة لشؤون الحرب والطيران -مازال يُحتفى به باعتباره رمزا للمقاومة البريطانية خلال الحرب العالمية الثانية– من أشد المدافعين عن الحفاظ على الإمبراطورية البريطانية حتى باستخدام أساليب قمعية مثيرة للجدل.

ففي عام 1919، كتب تشرشل صراحة أنه "يؤيد بشدة استخدام الغاز السام ضد القبائل غير المتحضرة"، وفي العام التالي أصدر أوامر باستخدام القوة المفرطة لقمع الانتفاضة في العراق، حيث نفّذ سلاح الجو الملكي أكثر من 4 آلاف ساعة من الطلعات القتالية، وأسقط ما يزيد عن 97 طنا من القنابل، وأطلق ما يزيد عن 184 ألف طلقة ضد المدنيين العراقيين، مما أسفر عن دمار واسع وسقوط أعداد كبيرة من الضحايا المدنيين.

وخلال الثورة الفلسطينية الكبرى بين عامي 1936 و1939، واجه البريطانيون المقاومة الفلسطينية بأساليب وحشية، تمثلت في الإعدامات العلنية دون محاكمة، وهدموا المنازل كعقاب جماعي، وفرضوا عقوبات جماعية على القرى المشتبه بدعمها للثوار، كما مارست قوات الانتداب التعذيب المنهجي في مراكز التحقيق بحق مئات المعتقلين الفلسطينيين خلال التحقيقات مع الفلسطينيين المشتبه بهم.

وشكّلت أساليب القمع البريطاني في أفريقيا نموذجا للوحشية المؤسسية الاستعمارية تحت غطاء التمدن ومسمى "إعادة التأهيل". ففي مالاوي وحدها، بين عامي 1948 و1960، أسفرت العمليات العسكرية عن مقتل نحو 6711 شخصا، وصفتهم بريطانيا بـ"الإرهابيين"، إلى جانب 2473 مدنيا، ضمن حملة استُخدمت فيها أقسى وسائل العنف العسكري.

وفي كينيا، تحولت البلاد إلى مسرح لانتهاكات واسعة خلال الثورة الكينية بقيادة شعب الكيكويو ضد الاستعمار البريطاني، حيث اعتُقل مئات الآلاف من المدنيين وزُجّ بهم في معسكرات اعتقال ومورست داخلها أشكال مختلفة من التعذيب، شملت الضرب والتجويع والانتهاكات الجنسية والعمل القسري والإذلال الممنهج.

وبحلول عام 1955 تم تهجير أكثر من مليون شخص من منازلهم في كينيا إلى مناطق مغلقة بالأسلاك الشائكة، وفقا للتقارير البحثية، وتشير السجلات إلى أن من بين ضحايا التعذيب كان جدّ الرئيس الأميركي الأسبق باراك أوباما.

وفي محاولة للقضاء على المقاومة، أسقطت القوات البريطانية أكثر من 6 ملايين قنبلة على غابات كينيا خلال 18 شهرا فقط. وبينما تقدّر الأرقام الرسمية عدد القتلى بنحو 11 ألف شخص، فإن مؤرخين بارزين، مثل ديفيد أندرسون من جامعة أكسفورد، يرجّحون أن العدد الحقيقي يصل إلى 25 ألفا، في حين قدّرت كارولين إلكينز من جامعة هارفارد عدد الضحايا بنحو أكثر من 300 ألف قتيل.

إعلان

التمييز الممنهج

شملت السيطرة البريطانية التمييز القانوني والاجتماعي ففي عام 1902، فرضت الإدارة الاستعمارية ضريبة الكوخ (Hut Tax) بعد أن صادرت أراضي السكان الأصليين، مما أجبرهم على العمل لدى المستوطنين الأوروبيين من أجل تأمين دخل لدفع هذه الضريبة.

وقد ترافقت هذه السياسة مع قوانين مجحفة، أبرزها قانون الأراضي الصادر عام 1913، الذي منح المستوطنين البيض في كينيا وجنوب أفريقيا امتيازات عقارية طويلة الأمد تصل إلى 999 عاما، في حين حُرم السكان الأصليون من حق التملك أو الإيجار في معظم الأراضي الخصبة.

وفي عام 1919، فرضت السلطات البريطانية على السكان الكينيين الأصليين حمل أقراص معدنية للتعريف الشخصي.

وقد اعتُبرت هذه الإجراءات من أوائل أشكال التمييز الممنهج الذي مارسته سلطات استعمارية باستخدام وسائل توثيق شخصية تُفرّق بين السكان على أساس العرق أو الأصل، في إجراء قارنه مختصون بما فعله النظام النازي لاحقا في أوروبا، وبأنظمة الفصل العنصري اللاحقة في أفريقيا.

التهجير القسري

وفي الستينيات، ومع تصاعد حركة الاستقلال في أفريقيا، نسّقت بريطانيا سرا مع الولايات المتحدة واحدة من أكبر عمليات التهجير القسري إثارة للجدل في تاريخها لترحيل سكان جزر تشاغوس من وطنهم، بهدف إنشاء قاعدة عسكرية أميركية على جزيرة دييغو غارسيا.

ورغم صدور عدد من الأحكام والتوصيات الدولية التي تدين هذا الفعل، أبرزها الرأي الاستشاري الصادر عن محكمة العدل الدولية في فبراير/شباط 2019، الذي خلص إلى أن استمرار السيطرة البريطانية على الأرخبيل غير قانوني، وأن على المملكة المتحدة إنهاء إدارتها "في أقرب وقت ممكن"، لم تُبدِ الحكومة البريطانية أي التزام فعلي بإعادة السكان أو الاعتراف بمسؤوليتها التاريخية.

في عام 2023، أصدرت منظمة "هيومن رايتس ووتش" تقريرا وصفت فيه التهجير القسري لسكان تشاغوس بأنه "جريمة ضد الإنسانية"، وطالبت فيه بمحاكمة المسؤولين عن الانتهاكات، إضافة إلى تعويض السكان وأحفادهم بشكل كامل وغير مشروط.

الاستغلال الاقتصادي والعبودية.. أدوات بريطانيا لبناء إمبراطوريتها

كانت السياسات البريطانية في مستعمراتها مبنية في الأساس على نهج الاستغلال الاقتصادي واستعمال العبودية، فلم تكن مجرد تدابير تنظيمية، بل وسيلة ممنهجة لتحقيق التوسع والثراء الاستعماري.

يتضح ذلك جليا في إقليم البنغال الهندي، حيث فرضت شركة الهند الشرقية زيادات حادة في الضرائب أدت إلى تدهور الوضع المعيشي للسكان، إذ تضاعفت الضرائب 3 مرات في غضون 5 سنوات فقط.

إعلان

وقد أسهمت هذه السياسة القسرية في التحصيل الضريبي، المصحوبة بتجاهل الإدارة البريطانية للمجاعات المتكررة، بشكل مباشر في وقوع مجاعة كبرى عام 1770، قُدّر عدد ضحاياها بنحو 10 ملايين بنغالي، أي ما يعادل ثلث سكان الإقليم في ذلك الوقت.

وتكشف الدراسات أن السياسات الاقتصادية البريطانية في الهند بين عامي 1765 و1938 أدت إلى نهب واستنزاف ما لا يقل عن 9 مليارات جنيه إسترليني من ثروات الهند.

ولم تقتصر سياسة الاستغلال هذه على شبه القارة الهندية، بل امتدت إلى ما وراء المحيط الأطلسي، حيث كانت بريطانيا لاعبا أساسيا في تجارة الرق، إذ شارك تجارها في استعباد أكثر من 3 ملايين أفريقي، نجا منهم نحو 2.7 مليون فقط من ظروف النقل القاسية، وقد شكل الأطفال نسبة كبيرة من الضحايا.

أتاحت العبودية لبريطانيا تراكم ثروات طائلة من خلال استغلال المستعبدين في إنتاج محاصيل مربحة كالسكر والقطن والتبغ، وأسهمت بشكل مباشر في تمويل الثورة الصناعية.

ورغم صدور قانون لحظر تجارة الرقيق عام 1807، فإن العبودية لم تُلغَ بالكامل حتى 1833، واستمر التمييز ضد المستعبدين السابقين فظلوا يواجهون عنصرية ممنهجة أبقتهم مواطنين من الدرجة الثانية، وهو إرث ما زالت آثاره ممتدة حتى اليوم.

السياسات الاستعمارية في الشرق الأوسط

لعبت بريطانيا دورا محوريا في تشكيل خريطة الشرق الأوسط خلال الحرب العالمية الأولى وما تلاها، من خلال انتهاج سياسات اتسمت بالتناقض والمراوغة، فقد أطلقت لندن سلسلة من الوعود السياسية المتضاربة.

إذ تعهدت للشريف حسين بدعم الاستقلال العربي عن الدولة العثمانية مقابل وقوفه إلى جانبها في الحرب. غير أن بريطانيا سرعان ما نكثت هذا الوعد، ودخلت في مفاوضات سرية مع فرنسا تمخضت عن اتفاقية سايكس-بيكو عام 1916، التي اقتسمت بموجبها القوتان النفوذ الاستعماري في المنطقة.

وبعد أيام قليلة من دخولها الحرب ضد الدولة العثمانية في نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني 1914، شرع مجلس الوزراء البريطاني في بحث مستقبل الحركة الصهيونية.

إعلان

وفي عام 1917 صدر وعد بلفور الشهير، الذي أعلنت فيه بريطانيا دعمها لإقامة وطن قومي لليهود في فلسطين، لتخضع فلسطين لاحقا للانتداب البريطاني (1920-1948) بتفويض من عصبة الأمم.

خلال تلك الفترة، شجعت بريطانيا الهجرة اليهودية إلى فلسطين وعملت على تعزيز نفوذها في المنطقة دون أن تلجأ إلى الضم المباشر بما يتطلبه من موارد وكلفة إدارية وعسكرية.

وقد لخّص أحد المؤرخين البريطانيين هذا النهج بقوله: "الاستنتاج الوحيد المنطقي هو أن الجميع كذبوا على الجميع، ولم يكذب أحد بأكثر براعة، بناء على طموحاته، مثل البريطانيين".

وفي عام 2017، رفضت الحكومة البريطانية تقديم أي اعتذار بشأن وعد بلفور، الذي قالت حينها إنه موضوع تاريخي ولا نية لها في الاعتذار عنه، بل أعربت عن الفخر بدور بريطانيا في إيجاد دولة إسرائيل.

وجاء هذا الموقف رغم التماس قُدم للحكومة وقع عليه أكثر من 11 ألف بريطاني يطالبون بالاعتذار عن الوعد، مما ألزم الحكومة بإصدار رد رسمي.

ضحايا مدنيون في المحاكم البريطانية

في عام 2012، شهدت المحكمة العليا في لندن واحدة من أبرز القضايا التاريخية التي سلطت الضوء على الجرائم الوحشية التي ارتكبتها بريطانيا خلال فترة استعمار كينيا، أدلى 4 مواطنين كينيين -بينهم امرأة تدعى جين مارا- بشهاداتهم أمام المحكمة حول الانتهاكات المروعة التي تعرضوا لها خلال حملة القمع البريطانية في خمسينيات القرن الماضي.

كانت جين تبلغ من العمر 15 عاما عندما جرى اعتقالها وتعذيبها بوحشية، وابتكر الجنود البريطانيون أداة تشبه الكماشة لاستخدامها في الضغط على المناطق الحساسة للمعتقلين، في محاولة لإلحاق أكبر قدر ممكن من الألم والإذلال.

أثناء جلسات المحاكمة، ظهرت أدلة قاطعة على أن السلطات البريطانية سعت إلى طمس هذه الجرائم، حيث تبين أن وثائق رسمية كانت قد أُخفيت أو نُقلت سرا إلى منشآت حكومية مراقبة، وفي ديسمبر/كانون الأول 2010، حكم القاضي بأن وزارة الخارجية ومنظمة الكومنولث البريطانية ملزمتان بالكشف عن الوثائق المرتبطة بالقضية.

ونتيجة لهذا القرار، تعهدت الحكومة البريطانية بإطلاق أكثر من 8800 ملف سري تعود إلى 37 مستعمرة سابقة، كانت مخزنة في منشأة شديدة الحراسة تعرف باسم "هانسلوب بارك" في مقاطعة باكينغهامشير.

إعلان

فتحت هذه القضية الباب لقضايا أخرى مشابهة، ففي أعقابها، قرر 35 من مقاتلي منظمة "إيوكا" القبرصية، التي خاضت نضالا مسلحا من أجل استقلال قبرص، رفع دعوى جماعية ضد الحكومة البريطانية.

وأكد المدّعون تعرضهم لانتهاكات جسيمة على أيدي القوات الاستعمارية في خمسينيات القرن الماضي، ومن بين هؤلاء امرأتان قدمتا شهادات مروعة عن معاملة غير إنسانية، تضمنت الاغتصاب والتعذيب والضرب والإيهام بالغرق.

عززت الوثائق التي أفرج عنها الأرشيف الوطني البريطاني عام 2012 مصداقية هذه الروايات، وكشفت عن أدلة موثقة على الانتهاكات، بما في ذلك مقتل رجل قبرصي كفيف أثناء حملة أمنية، لجأت الحكومة البريطانية مرة أخرى للتسوية المالية، معلنة أنها ستدفع مليون جنيه إسترليني كتعويض للمتضررين. غير أنها شددت في الوقت نفسه أن هذا الاتفاق لا يُعد اعترافا قانونيا بالمسؤولية عن الانتهاكات.

تدمير وإخفاء ممنهج للوثائق الاستعمارية

في أعقاب قضية كينيا 2012 أظهرت مراجعة رسمية أن بريطانيا قامت بإتلاف آلاف الوثائق التي توثق أكثر الجرائم خلال السنوات الأخيرة من الإمبراطورية البريطانية، لمنع وقوعها في أيدي حكومات ما بعد الاستقلال، مما يكشف عن محاولات متعمدة لمحو التاريخ الاستعماري القاتم وتفادي أي مساءلة قانونية.

أما الوثائق التي نجت من التدمير فقد تم نقلها سرا إلى أرشيف وزارة الخارجية، بعيدا عن متناول المؤرخين والجمهور، حيث تم إخفاؤها لما يقارب 50 عاما، في مخالفة صريحة للالتزامات القانونية التي تفرض إتاحتها للعلن.

تتضمن هذه الأوراق تعليمات التدمير المنهجي الصادرة في عام 1961 بعد أن وجه إيان ماكلويد، وزير الدولة لشؤون المستعمرات، بأن حكومات ما بعد الاستقلال يجب ألا تحصل على أي مواد "قد تحرج حكومة صاحبة الجلالة"، والتي يمكن أن "تحرج أفراد الشرطة أو القوات العسكرية أو الموظفين العموميين أو غيرهم مثل مخبري الشرطة"، وقد تعرض مصادر الاستخبارات للخطر.

إعلان

وضمن الوثائق القليلة التي كُشف عنها لاحقا، تبيّن أن الوزراء في لندن كانوا على دراية تامة بعمليات التعذيب والقتل التي تعرض لها متمردو ماو ماو في كينيا، ومن بينها حالة مروعة لامرأة "شُويت حية".

كما تضمنت السجلات تفاصيل عن التهجير القسري لسكان جزيرة دييغو غارسيا في المحيط الهندي، الذين أُجبروا على مغادرة أراضيهم بالقوة.

إضافة إلى وثائق حساسة من مستعمرة عدن، حيث كان فيلق المخابرات التابع للجيش البريطاني يدير مركزا سريا للتعذيب خلال ستينيات القرن الـ20. كذلك، تم تدمير جميع الوثائق الحساسة المتعلقة بمستعمرة غويانا البريطانية.

في كينيا، أُبلغ المسؤولون الاستعماريون بأن "البديل عن الإحراق هو وضع الوثائق في صناديق ثقيلة وإلقاؤها في أعماق البحر بعيدا عن الساحل".

اعتذارات مبهمة ومترددة

في الماضي، كان البريطانيون ينظرون إلى إمبراطوريتهم بفخر واعتزاز، باعتبارها فترة جلبت القوة والثروة إلى بريطانيا، وساهمت في تمويل الاكتشافات العلمية، وتوسيع آفاق التجارة الدولية، ومساعدة البلدان الأخرى على ولوج عالم الحداثة والتقدم.

لكن هذا التصور اصطدم باستطلاعات حديثة أظهرت أن 6 من كل 10 بريطانيين يؤيدون تقديم اعتذار رسمي لأحفاد ضحايا العبودية، سواء من الحكومة البريطانية أو العائلة المالكة، أو الشركات التي استفادت من استغلال البشر خلال الحقبة الاستعمارية، وتتعالى الأصوات المطالبة بالاعتذار أيضا خارج بريطانيا، حيث تزداد الدعوات في دول الكاريبي وأفريقيا إلى اتخاذ مواقف أكثر شجاعة تجاه الماضي الاستعماري.

خلال زيارته إلى كينيا عام 2023، أقر الملك تشارلز الثالث بارتكاب بريطانيا "أعمال عنف بغيضة وغير مبررة" خلال فترة الاستعمار، معبرا عن "الأسف العميق" لما حدث.

إعلان

ووصف الرئيس الكيني وليام روتو تصريحات الملك بأنها "خطوة شجاعة"، لكنه شدد على أن "التعويض الكامل لم يتحقق بعد".

أما لجنة حقوق الإنسان الكينية، فقد دعت الملك إلى تقديم "اعتذار علني غير مشروط"، معتبرة أن التصريحات البريطانية لا تزال "حذرة وتحمي مصالحها".

ويثير هذا التردد تساؤلات قانونية وأخلاقية، خاصة من منظور مختصين في القانون الدولي، فبينما تحمل الاعتذارات الرسمية رمزية سياسية عميقة، لكنها لا تُلزم الدولة قانونيا بأي التزامات مادية أو تعويضات، مما يجعل امتناع بريطانيا عن الاعتذار يبدو خيارا سياسيا أكثر منه ضرورة قانونية.

ورغم أن الإمبراطورية البريطانية لم تعد قائمة رسميا، فإن نفوذها الثقافي والاقتصادي لا يزال ملموسا، حيث يرى مراقبون أن الهيمنة البريطانية ما زالت تستمر اليوم في أشكال أكثر نعومة، من خلال مؤسسات دولية تبدو محايدة، كالكومنولث أو الأمم المتحدة أو منظمات متعددة الأطراف تحتفظ فيها القوى الاستعمارية السابقة بثقل كبير في صناعة القرار.

غالبًا ما يفضل العرب الزائرون لمملكة تايلند الإقامة في منطقة تشتهر باسم شارع العرب، ولذلك فعندما تتجول في هذه المنطقة تكاد تشعر أنك في بلد عربي.

معظم المحلات تضع لافتات بأسماء عربية، كما أن الكثير منها يبدو وكأنه يستهدف بالأساس الزائر العربي سواء كان قادما للسياحة أو للعلاج.

ولذلك ليس غريبا أن تجد كثيرا من العاملين في هذه المطاعم من العرب أو على الأقل ممن يجيدون اللغة العربية.

كان طبيعيا أن أقصد في أيامي الأولى بتايلند مطعما ومحل للبقالة كلاهما مجاور للفندق، لكن المفاجأة كانت بانتظاري عندما دخلت إلى كل منهما.

سمت وأسماء ولهجة

في البقالة كما في المطعم وجدت فتيات وشبانا يَبدون وكأنهم من العرب وبالتحديد من أهل الخليج العربي، تلحظ ذلك في سمتهم وفي لغتهم العربية بل لهجتهم الخليجية ومع هذا وذاك أسماؤهم.

ولهذا كان طبيعيا أن أحاول استكشاف الأمر، فسألت فتاة المطعم فأخبرتني أن اسمها هديل طلال وأنها عاشت كل سنوات عمرها السابقة في السعودية بل إنها ولدت هناك ثم درست المراحل الابتدائية والإعدادية والثانوية.

تقول هديل للجزيرة نت إنها تركت أسرتها في السعودية وعادت مع أخيها قبل عام من أجل الدراسة الجامعية في تخصص الفندقة والمطاعم وكذلك العمل بالتوازي مع الدراسة.

إعلان

الانتقال من السعودية حيث الأب والأم والصديقات والعودة إلى تايلند كان شديد الصعوبة في البداية، خصوصا وأن طمأنينة العيش في مكة المكرمة وزيارة المدينة المنورة تعطي الشخص الكثير من الراحة النفسية.

تضيف الشابة التايلندية: عشت كأني غريبة في بلادي لفترة ليست بالقصيرة، لكن مع الوقت تعودت على الحياة وتحمل المسؤولية وتعلمت أشياء كثيرة كنت أجهلها.

وعن العمل تقول هديل إن فرصه صعبة في جنوب تايلند، ولذلك تضطر وغيرها من الشبان والشابات للقدوم إلى العاصمة بانكوك حيث فرص العمل أكثر والدخل أكبر.

ذكريات جميلة

في المطعم نفسه التقينا الشاب ريان فطاني الذي يبلغ عمره 20 عاما عاش 3 أرباعها في السعودية قبل أن يعود إلى تايلند لدراسة إدارة الأعمال في مجال الطيران.

يقول ريان إنه ما زال يحمل ذكريات جميلة عن حياته في مدينة الطائف السعودية حيث عاش ودرس، ويخبرنا بأنه شعر بالحزن عندما غادر السعودية لكنه تأقلم لاحقا مع حياته الجديدة.

وبشأن عمله بالتوازي مع الدراسة الجامعة، يتفق ريان مع هديل في أن هذا هو الأمر الطبيعي بالنسبة للشباب في تايلند حيث يعتمدون على أنفسهم ابتداء من المرحلة الجامعية، ولذلك يعملون كل الوقت في فترة الإجازة التي تأتي غالبا بين شهري مارس/آذار ومايو/أيار من كل عام، ويعملون في الفترة المسائية خلال بقية الشهور حيث يدرسون في الصباح.

واختتمنا حوارنا مع الشاب النابه ريان عن المسلمين في تايلند فقال إنهم يعيشون في سلام سواء من كان منهم في الجنوب حيث الأغلبية المسلمة أو في العاصمة بانكوك.

شعور بالحنين

بجوار المطعم اليمني تقع البقالة التي تحمل هي الأخرى اسما عربيا، وفي الداخل وجدنا 5 فتيات لا يختلفن عمن بالمطعم من حيث السمت الإسلامي أو اللغة العربية بلهجة خليجية وخصوصا سعودية.

أسماء عبد المهيمن، التحقت بالجامعة بعد عودتها من السعودية ودرست مجال البرمجة، لكنها لم تجد بعد عملا مناسبا في تخصصها لذلك تعمل مؤقتا في المبيعات.

إعلان

وبجوارها كانت الشابة نوال دورلوه التي ولدت ودرست هي الأخرى بالسعودية ثم عادت إلى تايلند حيث تدرس إدارة الأعمال في مجال الأغذية الحلال.

تقول لنا إنها تتقن اللغة العربية أكثر مما تقن التايلندية، وتوضح لنا أن الأغلبية المسلمة في جنوب تايلند تتحدث بالأساس لغة الملايو التي تتحدث بها الجارة ماليزيا والتي قدم كثير من أجدادهم منها.

وعن الانتقال تقول نوال إنها ما زالت تشعر بالحنين إلى السعودية وتتمنى لو تعود للعمل يوما هناك أو في أي من الدول العربية الأخرى، وتوضح لنا أنها وقريناتها تأثرن كثيرا بالنشأة في السعودية ويظهر هذا في اللهجة والزي واللباس وحتى العادات والتقاليد.

الحلال ليس في الطعام فقط

وقبل أن ننهي حديثنا معها حرصت نوال على أن تحدثنا عن بعض ما استفادته من دراسة إدارة الأعمال في مجال الأغذية الحلال، لتوضح لنا أن صناعة الحلال في دولة ذات أغلبية غير مسلمة تبدو وكأنها تقتصر على الغذاء لكن الحقيقة أنها تمتد أيضا لمنتجات أخرى مثل الصابون ومساحيق التجميل التي قد تدخل في صناعتها مكونات غير حلال.

كما لفتت نوال إلى نقطة مهمة أخرى تتعلق بصناعة الحلال، حيث قالت إن هناك الكثير من المنتجات التي يتم صناعتها بشكل حلال إسلاميا لكن المنتجين لا يضعون عليها هذا الوصف لأن الحصول على رخصة الحلال يكلف مالا وإجراءات يجب القيام بها سنويا.

من جهة أخرى، سألنا هؤلاء الفتيات عن مدى متابعتهن للقضايا العربية والإسلامية، فقالت لنا هديل طلال إنها تهتم كثيرا بالمتابعة، وتوضح أنها شاركت في كثير من الفعاليات من أجل نصرة القضايا الإسلامية خصوصا في فلسطين وكذلك في سوريا والسودان ولبنان.

بلد الحرية

هديل كشفت لنا أيضا عن خطوة متقدمة للجمع بين هذه الفئة من الشبان والفتيات في تايلند حيث قالت إنهم قرروا تأسيس رابطة للتايلنديين والتايلنديات الذين ولدوا في السعودية وعقدوا بالفعل اجتماعين أحدهما في شهر رمضان الماضي والثاني في عيد الفطر للبدء في خطوات تأسيس وإشهار الرابطة بشكل رسمي.

إعلان

أما فيما يخص أوضاع المسلمين في تايلند فإن هديل اختارت طريقا لافتا للإجابة على هذا السؤال حيث قالت إن تايلند اسم على مسمى حيث يعني اسمها باللغة التايلندية أرض الحرية، ولذلك فكل شخص يعيش كما يحلو له ويمارس معتقداته في حرية ودون أي تدخل من الآخرين.

كشمير– على امتداد الطريق الوعرة التي تربط مظفر آباد، عاصمة كشمير الباكستانية، بوادي نيلم الملاصق لخط السيطرة الفاصل بين كشمير الهندية والباكستانية، تنكشف أمام الزائر لوحة طبيعية تخطف الأنفاس.

جبال خضراء تحتضن الطريق، وشلالات تنحدر برشاقة من السفوح، إذ يشق نهر نيلم طريقه بين التلال بصوت هادر يروي حكاية خالدة من الجمال والعراقة.

لكن خلف هذه الصورة البديعة، ثمة واقع آخر لا تُظهره الصور ولا تُعبّر عنه المناظر الطبيعية، واقع إنساني صعب يعيشه الأهالي بصمت، بعيدا عن عدسات المصورين وأعين المسؤولين.

قطعة من الجنة

يصف عارف محمود (زائر من إسلام آباد) لموفد الجزيرة نت، انطباعه عن المنطقة قائلا "وادي نيلم قطعة من الجنة على الأرض. الطبيعة هنا ساحرة، الهواء نقي، وكل زاوية تصلح لأن تكون لوحة فنية".

ما يُخفيه الجمال هنا هو بنية تحتية متهالكة، ومنازل بالكاد تصلح للسكن، وطرقات تتآكل تحت وقع الزمن والإهمال. السكان، الذين يعيشون على بعد أمتار من أحد أكثر خطوط التماس توترا في جنوب آسيا، يكافحون لتأمين أبسط مقومات الحياة اليومية، محملين استمرار استهدافهم من قبل الهند عدم استقرار وصعوبة الحياة التي يكابدونها.

منازل مهددة وطرقات

يقول شفيق عباسي، أحد سكان قرية قريبة من خط السيطرة، "في كل شتاء نخشى أن تهطل الأمطار بغزارة، لأن ذلك يعني انهيارات وانقطاع طرق. منازل عدة لا تصمد أمام الطقس القاسي. نعيش بقلق دائم".

إعلان

وعزا في حديثه للجزيرة نت عدم الاهتمام بتطوير البنية التحتية وتحسين مستوى المباني والمساكن إلى استمرار عدم الاستقرار في المنطقة حيث كل عام أو عامين تحدث مواجهات على جانبي خط السيطرة بين الهند وباكستان.

تتسم الطرق في المنطقة بالضيق والتشقق، وبعضها غير ممهد، مما يجعل التنقل خطرا حقيقيا، خاصة خلال موسم الأمطار أو عند وقوع الانهيارات الجبلية. ويقول عباسي "حين يمرض أحد أطفالنا، قد يستغرق الوصول إلى أقرب مركز صحي ساعات".

اقتصاد هش وتعليم غائب

تعتمد غالبية سكان المنطقة على الزراعة وتربية المواشي كمصدر دخل رئيسي، إضافة إلى حياكة الصوف وصناعة الشالات الكشميرية المشهورة إلى جانب بعض الموارد التي تحقق من زيارات السياح ومعظمهم من داخل باكستان.

في الأسواق المحلية، البضائع محدودة، والأسعار مرتفعة، مما يعكس ضعف القوة الشرائية.

المدارس تعاني في مبان قديمة وصغيرة من نقص شديد في الكوادر والتجهيزات. وتقول مريم بيغم، معلمة في مدرسة ابتدائية، "نعمل من دون كتب كافية أو مواد تعليمية. كثير من الطلاب يتركون المدرسة ليساعدوا أهلهم في الزراعة أو العمل. التعليم هنا ترف لا يمكن للجميع الاستمرار فيه".

خارج التنمية

السكان يشتكون من ضعف للخدمات في مجالات التعليم، والصحة، والمواصلات. ويقول عبد الرؤوف جان أحد سكان المنطقة: "بسبب قربنا من خط السيطرة (الذي يشهد عادة اقتتالا)، فإن منطقتنا تصنف كمنطقة عسكرية وإنها عرضة لأي قصف أو هجوم، فالتنمية متوقفة منذ عقود".

المواجهة بين الهند وباكستان

ومما زاد من قتامة المشهد في كشمير مؤخرا، احتدام المواجهات بين الجارتين النوويتين الهند وباكستان وخاصة على امتداد خط السيطرة الذي يقسم كشمير.

فقد أدّت المواجهات المسلحة المتقطعة إلى قتلى وجرحى إلى جانب إلحاق دمار ببيوت ومحال ومدارس في الجزء الباكستاني من كشمير، كما اضطر المئات للنزوح من القرى الحدودية، بعد أن أصبحت مساكنهم عرضة مباشرة للقصف.

إعلان

ولم تتوقف تداعيات هذا التوتر عند الجانب الأمني، بل تجاوزته لتطول الحياة اليومية للسكان، إذ تسبب في شلل مؤقت للأنشطة الزراعية والتجارية، خصوصا في المناطق القريبة من نقاط الاشتباك.

كرم رغم الوجع

ورغم هذه المعاناة، يستقبل أهالي كشمير الزوار بوجه بشوش وكرم كبير. وبالعودة إلى عارف محمود، قال: "الناس هنا يخبئون أوجاعهم خلف ابتسامات".

سياحة محتجزة

يُجمع الأهالي على أن غياب الأمن والاستقرار بسبب النزاع مع الهند، إضافة إلى ضعف البنية التحتية المتحصلة من ذلك، من أبرز أسباب ضعف السياحة، رغم الإمكانيات الطبيعية الهائلة التي منحها الله لوادي نيلم تحديدا ولكشمير بشكل عام.

يقول عبد الرؤوف: "لو فُتحت كشمير على العالم، لكانت من أهم الوجهات السياحية. لكننا نعيش في عزلة مفروضة بسبب الصراع المتواصل بين الجارتين اللدودتين".

وخلال الأعوام الـ12 الماضية شهدت كشمير الباكستانية العديد من الاعتداءات الهندية، من أبرزها:

في مايو/أيار 2025، شنت الهند هجمات صاروخية على مناطق مدنية في كشمير الباكستانية، مما أسفر عن قتلى وإصابات، كما استهدفت منازل ومساجد.

في يونيو/حزيران 2023، تعرض قطاع ساتوال بمنطقة بونش في كشمير الباكستانية لإطلاق نار من قبل القوات الهندية أدى لقتلى وجرحى، واعتُبر أول خرق للهدنة الموقعة في فبراير/شباط 2021.

خلال عامي 2020 و2021، شهدت المنطقة تصعيدا على خط السيطرة، حيث أفادت السلطات الباكستانية بمقتل 28 مدنيًا وإصابة 233 آخرين نتيجة القصف الهندي، في حين أفادت الهند بمقتل 6 مدنيين و9 جنود من جانبها.

في نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني 2016، قُتل 3 مدنيين وأصيب 3 آخرون في كشمير الباكستانية نتيجة قصف هندي استهدف منازل في قطاع باتال.

في عام 2013 وقعت سلسلة من الاشتباكات المسلحة بين القوات الهندية والباكستانية على خط المراقبة، مما أسفر عن مقتل 12 جنديًا هنديًا و9 جنود باكستانيين، بالإضافة إلى مقتل نحو 14 مدنيا باكستانيا، ومدني هندي واحد.

خطر الحرب

وتعليقا على الموضوع قال الخبير السياسي الكشميري خالد محمود خان إن السبب في ضعف الخدمات في وادي نيلم وكشمير، يعود إلى أن المنطقة مهددة بخطر الحرب والاستهداف من قبل الهند.

إعلان

وفي حديثه للجزيرة نت بين خان أن هذه المنطقة جديرة بأن تكون من أفضل المناطق في العالم جذبا للسياحة لكن الأوضاع السياسية وعدم الاستقرار حالت دون جذب الكثير من السياح خاصة القادمين من الخارج لكونها منطقة عسكرية ومهددة بالحرب في أي وقت.

وعادة ما تتهم الحكومة المحلية في كشمير الباكستانية والحكومة الفدرالية الباكستانية الهند بالوقوف وراء عدم استقرار كشمير وبالتالي عدم التمكين من تطويرها والنهوض بها لتكون قبلة للسياحة العالمية.

نواكشوط – تحت شعار "مليونية نساء موريتانيا لوقف قتل نساء وأطفال غزة"، شهدت العاصمة الموريتانية نواكشوط، مساء أمس السبت، مسيرة نسائية حاشدة تنديدا بجرائم الإبادة والتجويع التي يتعرض لها الفلسطينيون في قطاع غزة، وسط صمت عربي ودولي متزايد.

وانطلقت المسيرة من ساحة الحرية، الواقعة قرب القصر الرئاسي ومبنى البرلمان، باتجاه مقر ممثلية الأمم المتحدة، بدعوة من منظمات نسائية وهيئات مدنية وسياسية، وبدعم من مختلف أطياف المشهد السياسي، في مقدمتها حزب "الإنصاف" الحاكم، وحزب "تواصل" المعارض.

وقدرت أعداد المشاركات بعشرات الآلاف، ورددت خلالها الهتافات المؤيدة للمقاومة الفلسطينية، والمنددة بجرائم الاحتلال بحق المدنيين، خاصة النساء والأطفال. كما رفعن لافتات تندد باستمرار الحرب والحصار على غزة، في وقت تتصاعد فيه الغارات ويشتد الخناق على السكان والنازحين.

نداء استغاثة

وفي كلمتها خلال الفعالية، أطلقت فاطمة الميداح، رئيسة مجلس نساء "الرباط الوطني لنصرة الشعب الفلسطيني"، نداء استغاثة عاجلا إلى الأمة العربية والإسلامية لإنقاذ غزة، معتبرة أن "الصمت عار، والتخاذل عن نصرة المظلومين خيانة".

وأضافت الميداح "لا كرامة لنا إن تركت غزة وحدها، فعدوها وعدونا واحد، وقد ظهر ذلك جليا بعد طوفان الأقصى حين اجتمع الأعداء لتمكين الاحتلال"، مؤكدة أن الشعارات الدولية لحماية المرأة والطفل "انكشفت زيفا وباتت بلا معنى"، في ظل المجازر المستمرة.

وفي مستهل كلمتها، حيت الميداح الأسيرات والمرابطات الفلسطينيات، مشيدة بصمود المرأة الغزية التي باتت، "رمزا للتضحية والكرامة والتمسك بالثوابت".

رسالة تضامن

تأتي هذه المسيرة ضمن سلسلة احتجاجات شعبية في موريتانيا منذ السابع من أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2023، حيث دأب الموريتانيون على تنظيم مسيرات أسبوعية انطلاقا من الجامع الكبير وصولا إلى مقر سفارة الولايات المتحدة أو بعثة الأمم المتحدة، تعبيرا عن التضامن مع غزة ورفضا للعدوان المستمر.

إعلان

وأكدت خديجة المجتبى، رئيسة رابطة الصحفيين الموريتانيين من أجل الأقصى، في حديثها للجزيرة نت، أن المسيرة "تعد امتدادا طبيعيا للحراك الشعبي الواسع في موريتانيا نصرة لغزة، وللتنديد بجرائم الاحتلال، التي تجاوزت كل حدود الإنسانية".

وأضافت المجتبى "الوضع في غزة مأساوي ولا يحتمل، والعالم يقف عاجزا عن وقف هذه المجازر، وهو ما يستدعي ضغطا شعبيا مستمرا لكسر الحصار ووقف الحرب التي تفتك بالأطفال والنساء".

وتابعت أن المسيرة "تحمل رسالة تضامن قوية من المرأة الموريتانية لأخواتها في فلسطين، ورسالة إلى العالم بأن غزة ليست وحدها". لكنها في الوقت ذاته، "تعبر عن ألم عميق من عجز العالمين العربي والدولي عن فك الحصار وإيصال الغذاء للمحاصرين، الذين يموت أطفالهم جوعا أمام أعين الجميع".

أما الشابة سكينة، البالغة من العمر 20 عاما، فقد أجلت سفرها للمشاركة في المسيرة، وقالت للجزيرة نت إنها جاءت للإعلان عن دعمiا الكامل للمقاومة، و"لرفض الإبادة التي تمارس ضد أهلنا في غزة، هذه معركة كرامة وقضية أمة بأكملها".

تضحيات نسائية

طوال الحرب على غزة، لعبت المرأة الموريتانية دورا بارزا في دعم القضية الفلسطينية، سواء بالمواقف أو التبرعات العينية والنقدية. ووفق خديجة المجتبى، "تبرعت كثيرات بحليهن، ومنهن من قدمن أراضي وسيارات، بل إن نساء من البوادي قدمن من أنعامهن دعما لغزة".

وفي السياق ذاته، أشادت النائب البرلمانية ورئيسة اللجنة المنظمة للمسيرة، ازعورة شيخا بيدية، بمشاركة "نساء شنقيط، أرض المنارة والرباط"، مشيرة إلى أن الحشد النسائي مساء السبت "يعبر عن تجذر القضية الفلسطينية في وجدان الشعب الموريتاني".

وأضافت في حديث للجزيرة نت "من خلال هذه المسيرة أوصلت نساء موريتانيا، من مختلف التوجهات السياسية والاهتمامات المهنية، رسالة رفض واضحة للجرائم الوحشية المرتكبة في غزة، وتأكيدا على الالتفاف حول خيار المقاومة كطريق لاسترداد الكرامة".

إعلان

وأوضحت أن "مليونية نساء موريتانيا" تجسد صرخة غضب شعبية، ورسالة نسائية حاسمة في وجه الصمت الدولي، تعكس حجم التضامن الشعبي المتجذر في البلاد، وتؤكد أن القضية الفلسطينية ما زالت في قلب أولويات الشارع الموريتاني، نساء ورجالا.

غزة- وقف الفتى الغزي يوسف السمري (15 عاما) أمام بائع الخبز في أحد شوارع الحرب، كل ما يطلبه رغيف واحد يسكت به صراخ جوعٍ نخر أحشاءه وسرق النوم من عينيه، سأل عن سعر الرغيف، فأجابه البائع: 8 شواكل (الدولار يساوي 3.6 شواكل)، وهو مبلغٌ لا يملكه، فجال بنظره باحثًا عن بصيص رحمة، لعلّ تكية ما توزّع وجبة تُطفئ نار المعدة، لكنه وجد طوابير من الناس يلهثون خلف طعام بارد تعافه نفسه.

كان الجوع والغضب يأكلانه شيئًا فشيئًا، فرفع رأسه نحو والده الذي كان برفقته، وقال بعينين تتوهّجان كجمرتين "سأذهب إلى غرفتنا التي كنا نازحين إليها في المدرسة، حيث تركنا طعامنا، أمامي خياران: إما أن أعود لكم بالطحين فنأكل، أو لا أعود وأموت، وأنا متقبل للخيارين".

عبثا حاول الأب منعه وتوسّل إليه ألا يذهب وحده، لكن يوسف فضل المخاطرة بروحه فقط، وقال لأبيه "يموت واحد أم نموت نحن الاثنان؟ ادعُ لي سأعود سريعًا".

في طريقه، مرّ بجثث متناثرة لأناس سبقوه في المهمة ذاتها، دفعهم الجوع إلى المجازفة، فكان الثمن أرواحهم، لكنه لم يتراجع، وصل أخيرًا إلى مدرسة سعد بن معاذ في حي التفاح، حيث كانت أسرته قد نزحت تحت وابل من النيران ولم تستطع أن تحمل معها شيئًا، وحين وصوله، فتح يوسف حقيبته المدرسية وحشاها بأكياس المعكرونة التي باتت طعامًا بديلًا للدقيق، ثم حمل كيس الطحين الثقيل على كتفه، والفرحة تملأ قلبه.

إعلان

يقول للجزيرة نت "قَسما، إنني زغردت حين حملته (كيس الطحين) وتنهدت تنهيدة المحارب اللي ظفر بالغنيمة". في طريق عودته لم تتوقف نداءات الناس عليه "هل هذا الطحين للبيع؟" وهو يردد إجابته "لا، سأفاجئ به أمي، نريد أن نأكل"، لكن نشوته بانتصاره لم تكتمل، حيث أطلقت طائرة كواد كابتر قنبلة عليه، "شعرت أنني أهوي في بئر أو حفرة" لم يكن يعلم أن القنبلة قد نسفت ساقيه، وأسقطته أرضًا، تمتم بالشهادتين مرارًا، وغاب عن الوعي.

عاد بلا قدمين

على السرير في مستشفى المعمداني حين استفاق يوسف، فتح عينيه ليجد يد أبيه تمسك بيده، فبدأ يردد "الحمد لله، الحمد لله"، بينما كانت عينا والده تغصّ بالحسرة والرعب، لا سيما حين علم أن ولده سيخضع لعدة عمليات لبتر ساقيه، واستئصال جزء من الطحال، كما خسر 70% من إحدى خصيتيه، وهو واقعٌ مرّ لن يستفيق يوسف على تفاصيله إلا بعد أيام.

صار يوسف يسأل عن ساقيه، كان من حوله يخفون عنه الحقيقة، فعدم قدرته على الانحناء كانت تحول دون تحسس قدميه، لكنه استغل قوته في ليلة ما مستغلا نوم من حوله، فمدّ يديه يتحسس ساقيه فلم يجد شيئًا، يقول للجزيرة نت بصوت متهدج "وجدتني أمسك فراغا، قلت حينها بيعوض الله، راحوا رجليا".

سألته مراسلة الجزيرة نت: ما أول شيء خطر ببالك بعد ما تأكدت من فقدانهما؟، فأجاب: الكرة، كنت أحب لعب الكرة كثيرا، غير أني راجعت نفسي هل الجوع أقسى؟ أم الحال التي وصلت إليها الآن؟

عقب مقابلة الجزيرة نت، كان يوسف يتحضر لمغادرة المستشفى المعمداني، سيعود لأمه خالي الوفاض بقدمين مبتورتين وأعضاء مستأصلة كانت خسارة محاولته لجلب ما يسد الرمق، بينما جاءت الكلفة على هذا النحو، حين كلف الحاج عادل حلس روحي ولديه خالد وكريم.

وداع جلب الطحين

بينما كان الأب وأبناؤه يتحضرون للذهاب إلى منزلهم لجلب ما تبقى من طحين ومؤونة، كانت الأم تقف على عتبة الخوف، قلبها مقبوض يُحدّثها بأن هذا المشهد هو الأخير، همّت بالخروج معهم، لكنها لم تُمنح تلك الفرصة، "خليكي، إحنا بنرجع بسرعة"، هكذا قالوا لها، لكنهم لم يعودوا.

إعلان

في منطقة التركمان، وسط بيوت الشجاعية المهجورة، بدأ الشابان بجمع بعض المواد الغذائية المتبقية، بينما كان الأب يبحث عن لحظة دفء صغيرة في منزلهم الذي اختنق بالشوق والرماد، فأحبّ أن يحتسي كأسا من الشاي ريثما ينتهيان.

أحدهما يشعل النار، والآخر يُرتّب الأغراض، وقد كانت المسافة الفاصلة بينهما أقل من متر، قبل أن تخترق قنبلة من طائرة كواد كابتر صمت اللحظة، لتخترق شظاياها أجسادهم الثلاثة دفعة واحدة. استشهد الشابان على الفور، وأُصيب الأب بجروح بالغة.

تقول الأم للجزيرة نت "بين خروجهم وسماع صوت الانفجار نصف ساعة فقط، ركضت أنا وابنتي روان، كنا نحاول أن نكذب عيوننا التي ترى تصاعد الدخان من حول منزلنا، لكن الخبر سبقنا، جاءني رسول من بعيد، قال أبو محمد مصاب، عرفت وقتها أن ولداي قد استُشهدا، ووقعت من هول الصدمة".

أما شقيقتهم روان، فركضت بجنون إلى المنزل، رأتهم جثتين هامدتين بين الركام، دخلت في حالة هستيرية، كانت تحاول سحب جثمانيهما بيديها، تصرخ وتبكي وتستنجد طالبة المساعدة، حتى استجاب لها أحد أقاربهم وتمكنا من انتشالهما من بين الأنقاض.

لم تكن تلك العائلة الوحيدة التي ودّعت أبناءها على أمل اللقاء القريب، ولم يعودوا، فبينما كانت أمٌ تراقب خطوات زوجها وابنيها وهم يغادرون المنزل لجلب ما يسد الرمق، كانت عائلة أخرى تعيش الانتظار ذاته، وتخوض الألم نفسه بقلبٍ لا يقلّ وجعًا.

شهداء مجهولو الهوية

مرّ يومٌ كامل على غياب الأخوين معتصم ومعاذ رجب، عن خيمتهم المؤقتة التي لجؤوا إليها بعدما هربوا من منزلهم الكائن شرق حي التفاح، تحت وابل من القذائف الإسرائيلية، 24 ساعة من الانتظار القاتل، كانت خلالها هواتفهم ترنّ دون رد، لم يحتمل والدهم الحاج أدهم الجلوس، فقد مزّق القلق قلبه ودفعه لأن يخاطر بنفسه، ويذهب إلى المنزل علّه يجد أثرًا، أو يسمع خبرًا.

إعلان

يقول للجزيرة نت بصوت مخنوق "كنت أنطق الشهادتين مع كل متر تخطوه قدماي، وحين اقتربت من الحي لم أجد منزلي، لم يكن هناك أحد لا وجوه، ولا أصوات"، حاول الحاج أدهم أن ينقّب بين الأنقاض، لعله يجد أثرا لهما، لكن دون جدوى، إلى أن تلقى اتصالا من ولده الثالث "لقيت معتصم ومعاذ في مستشفى المعمداني ضمن الشهداء مجهولي الهوية".

يقول الحاج أدهم للجزيرة نت "خرجوا دون أن يقولوا لي، لو علمت -والله- لم أكن لأسمح لهم بالخروج".

يحاول أن يتمالك نفسه، لكنه يعود بذاكرته للوراء، عندما أُصيب ابنه الأكبر للسبب نفسه، ويتابع "كانوا رايحين يجيبوا أكل، أكل من بيتنا اللي طلعنا منه بسرعة وما حملنا منه شيئا"، يكفكف عبراته مستهجنا الجرم الإسرائيلي بحق الأبرياء "شباب مدنيون، يرتدون زيا رياضيا، لا يحملون سلاحا ولا عتادا، كانت وجهتهم جلب الطعام، وخسروا أرواحهم من أجل ذلك".

ثمن لقمة العيش

عوائل غزية تدفع ثمن لقمة العيش من دماء أبنائها، فحسب الدفاع المدني الفلسطيني، وعلى لسان الناطق باسمه محمود بصل، في حديثه للجزيرة نت، كشف عن ارتقاء أكثر من 20 شهيدًا، خلال الأيام القليلة الماضية، وإصابة العشرات بينما كانوا يحاولون فقط الوصول إلى منازلهم لإحضار الطحين والطعام، من المناطق الشرقية لحي الشجاعية والتفاح، وشرق حي الزيتون.

يُكمل بصل "لقد نُقلت الجثث بوسائل بدائية، بعضها على عربات تجرها الحمير، وآخرون لا يزالون في الشوارع تنهشهم الكلاب الضالة، وبعض الشهداء سقطوا داخل منازلهم، قُصفوا لحظة دخولهم، قبل أن يتمكنوا حتى من فتح الخزائن".

فمنذ مارس/آذار الماضي، وإسرائيل تضيّق الخناق على غزة، من خلال المعابر المغلقة، والغذاء الممنوع من العبور، عشرات الشاحنات التي دخلت إلى جنوب القطاع، وصفتها المؤسسات الدولية بأنها "نقطة في بحر الاحتياج لمليوني جائع ومحاصر"، أما شمال وادي غزة، فما زال خارج معادلة الرحمة، محرومًا من الغذاء، مما يعني أن قائمة الشهداء ما زالت قابلة للتمدد، أمام من لا يملكون رفاهية الخيار إما يموت أبناؤهم جوعًا، أو يموتون وهم يحاولون أن يؤمنوا لهم لقمة عيش تحفظ كرامتهم.

غزة- تعمّد جيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي تدميرَ مصادر وشبكات المياه في قطاع غزة، بعد أن استهدفها بغاراته الجوية وعملياته البرية في إطار حربه لتقويض مقومات الحياة وإجبار الفلسطينيين على هجر أماكن سكنهم.

ويقول مدير عام مصادر المياه في سلطة المياه بقطاع غزة، منذر سالم، إن إسرائيل دمَّرت 85% من مصادر المياه، وأنهكت قطاع المياه المستنزف أساسا، ولم تعد المياه الصالحة للشرب والمخصصة للاستهلاك اليومي متاحة أمام أكثر من مليوني فلسطيني يعيشون داخل غزة.

وحذَّر في حديث خاص للجزيرة نت، من آثار تلوث المياه على صحة المواطنين الذين يضطرون إلى قطع مسافات طويلة للحصول على القليل منها، وفي كثير من الأحيان تفشل مهمتهم في توفيرها.

المصدر الأهم

ويعتمد قطاع غزة -حسب سالم- على ثلاثة مصادر للمياه؛ أولها الخزان الجوفي الذي كان مستنزفا قبل الحرب وأصبح منهكا، حيث أظهرت آخر التحاليل التي سبقت العدوان الإسرائيلي عام 2023، أن 97% من مياهه غير صالحة للشرب، بينما تُمثل المصدر الثاني محطات التحلية، سواء العامة أو الخاصة، التي زاد الاعتماد عليها كثيرا خلال الحرب.

وتوفر المصدر الثالث شركة مياه "ميكروت" الإسرائيلية، بناء على اتفاق أوسلو، حيث بدأت بتزويد قطاع غزة بـ5 ملايين متر مكعب من المياه سنويا عبر 3 محاور واقعة شرق مدينة غزة، وشرق المغازي وسط القطاع، وشرق عبسان جنوبه، وارتفعت الكمية في 2023 لتصل إلى 21 مليون متر مكعب سنويا.

إعلان

واستعرض سالم التفاصيل الصعبة لواقع الخزان الجوفي في قطاع غزة، الذي يعتمد على مياه الأمطار لتعويضه، لكن كثرة الاستهلاك وعشوائيته أنهكته وأصبح ملوثا.

وأضاف "يمثل الاعتماد الأكبر على الخزان الجوفي بما يعادل 85% من إجمالي مصادر المياه، وزادت هذه النسبة خلال الحرب بعدما قطعت إسرائيل إمدادات المياه التي تزود بها القطاع، فور عودة العدوان عليه في مارس/آذار الماضي".

سياسة التعطيش

ودمَّر الاحتلال أكثر من 80% من آبار المياه العامة، التي كانت توفر الماء لمعظم المناطق السكنية، ما يؤكد وجود مخطط إسرائيلي لتعطيش سكان قطاع غزة، حسب المسؤول سالم.

ولفت إلى أن معظم الآبار التي يتم إعادة تشغيلها بعد تنفيذ أعمال صيانة طارئة عليها، لا تعمل بالكفاءة المطلوبة نظرا للأضرار الجسيمة التي لحقت بمنظومة المياه، ما أدى إلى انخفاض إنتاج هذه المصادر ما بين 30-35% مما كان عليه قبل العدوان.

وكانت محافظات قطاع غزة تعتمد في استخراج المياه الجوفية على 300 بئر تنتج 262 ألف متر مكعب في اليوم، إلا أن أضرارا لحقت بها قلصتها إلى أدنى مستوى.

وأدت عمليات النزوح المستمرة التي يفرضها الجيش الإسرائيلي على سكان جميع محافظات قطاع غزة إلى تجمعهم في أماكن محدودة، والعمل على حفر آبار منزلية جديدة أو إصلاح بعض المصادر الجوفية التي أصابها الدمار كي يتمكنوا من توفير المياه.

وأشار سالم إلى العراقيل التي تصطدم بمحاولات تشغيل الآبار المتبقية في قطاع غزة، منها غياب مصادر الطاقة اللازمة لعملها بسبب منع الاحتلال إدخال الوقود، وارتفاع تكلفة تشغيلها عبر الطاقة الشمسية التي دمر العدوان معظمها.

وأوضح أن القدرة التخزينية للنازحين تقتصر على غالونات مياه محدودة السعة بسبب النزوح والدمار الذي طال خزانات المياه الكبيرة، وبالتالي، فإنه عند انقطاع المياه عنهم ليوم واحد فقط، فسيتركوا دون ماء، وهو ما يزيد من الأزمات اليومية التي يعيشها معظم سكان القطاع.

التلوث وأخطاره

وزاد اعتماد سكان قطاع غزة على محطات تحلية المياه التي كانت تغطي 10% فقط من مجمل احتياجهم، حيث اضطرت لزيادة كميات إنتاجها رغم ارتفاع تكلفتها بشكل ملحوظ.

وقال سالم: إن محطات التحلية تجتهد من خلال المؤسسات الخيرية والمبادرات المجتمعية لإيصال أكبر قدر ممكن من الماء إلى محافظات قطاع غزة، وهذا يساعد على توفير حصة يومية من المياه حتى لو كانت قليلة.

وتطرَّق إلى مخاطر تلوث مياه الشرب، حيث يتكدس مئات المواطنين حول شاحنات توزيعها، مما يتسبب أحيانا بوصول الرمال والأتربة إلى الغالونات المخصصة لنقل المياه.

إعلان

وبيّن المسؤول سالم، أن كل 1 غرام من الرمل يحتوي على 5 ميكروبات، ما يزيد من خطر الإصابة بالأمراض المعوية، وحذَّر من أن تراكم النفايات الصلبة في غزة يؤدي مباشرة إلى تسرب التلوث للمياه.

وشدد سالم على أن مصادر المياه تحتاج إلى إعادة تأهيل شاملة بما فيها محطات تحلية المياه، ومحطات الضخ، والآبار، وخزانات المياه، وخطوط النقل الرئيسية، وشبكات المياه، كي تتمكن الجهات المختصة من تلبية احتياجات المواطنين الطبيعية للمياه.

أعلن الاتحاد الأوروبي، يوم الثلاثاء الماضي، رفع العقوبات الاقتصادية المفروضة على سوريا، في خطوة وصفها مراقبون بأنها تحمل أبعاداً سياسية واقتصادية بالغة الأهمية.

وأكدت كايا كالاس، ممثلة السياسة الخارجية في الاتحاد، أن التكتل الأوروبي يهدف إلى "مساعدة الشعب السوري على إعادة بناء سوريا جديدة، مسالمة، تضم جميع الأطياف"، مشددة على التزام أوروبا بدعم السوريين على مدى السنوات الماضية.

وأوضح دبلوماسيون أوروبيون، أن القرار يشمل رفع العقوبات التي كانت تستهدف قطاعات اقتصادية ومصرفية محددة، وذلك بهدف دعم تعافي البلاد، دون أن يشمل ذلك رفع العقوبات العسكرية أو تلك المتعلقة بانتهاكات حقوق الإنسان.

ورحّبت سوريا برفع الولايات المتحدة رسميا العقوبات الاقتصادية التي كانت مفروضة على البلاد، معتبرة أنها "خطوة إيجابية في الاتجاه الصحيح"، في وقت تحاول السلطات دفع عجلة التعافي الاقتصادي وتحسين علاقتها مع الدول الغربية، بعد نزاع مدمر استمر 14 عاما.

أبعاد القرار الأوروبي

وفي تصريح لـ "الجزيرة نت"، رأى مازن علوش، مدير العلاقات في الهيئة العامة للمنافذ البرية والبحرية، أن القرار الأوروبي فرصة لإعادة تفعيل النشاط التجاري واللوجستي، خاصة في مجالات الاستيراد والتصدير للمواد الإنسانية والطبية والتجهيزات الصناعية.

وأكد أن تعزيز التبادل التجاري عبر القنوات الرسمية من شأنه أن يُسهم في تقليص نشاط السوق السوداء والمعابر غير القانونية، الأمر الذي سينعكس إيجابيا على الاقتصاد الوطني.

إعلان

مع ذلك، حذر علوش من الإفراط في التفاؤل، مشيرًا إلى أن التطبيق الفعلي للقرار يرتبط بمدى شموليته وآليات تنفيذه، إضافة إلى مواقف الدول المجاورة التي تُعد محاور رئيسية لعبور البضائع.

وأضاف أن تنفيذ القرار يتطلب تنسيقاً فنياً واسعاً مع شركاء إقليميين ودوليين، لضمان استفادة المعابر البرية والمرافئ البحرية من هذا الانفتاح المنتظر.

كما كشف علوش عن وجود خطط لتحديث قوائم المواد المسموح باستيرادها وتصديرها، بالتعاون مع الجهات الحكومية ذات الصلة، مشيراً إلى أن هناك تقييماً فنياً جارياً للبنية التحتية في المرافئ والمعابر تحسباً لازدياد متوقع في النشاط التجاري.

موقف المعارضة السورية

من جانبه، قال محمد علاء غانم، رئيس الشؤون السياسية في المجلس السوري الأميركي، إن العقوبات الأوروبية كانت رداً مباشراً على القمع الذي مارسه النظام السوري منذ عام 2011، وشملت قطاعات النفط والمصارف وتصدير التكنولوجيا، إلى جانب حظر تصدير الأسلحة.

وأشار إلى أن رفع العقوبات الأوروبية أخيراً يعكس تفاعلاً مع سياسة الولايات المتحدة، التي كانت قد أعلنت قبل أيام نيتها تخفيف بعض عقوباتها، معتبراً أن السياسة الأوروبية تأتي في إطار التناغم مع التوجه الأميركي.

وأضاف أن العقوبات الأميركية لا تزال الأشد تأثيراً على النظام.

ووفقاً لغانم، فإن التطورات الأخيرة جاءت نتيجة "جهد سوري منظم"، مؤكداً أن "السوريين نجحوا في تحقيق ما كان قد يستغرق سنوات في بضعة أشهر فقط".

وأوضح أهمية الدور الأوروبي في المرحلة المقبلة، لكنه شدد على أن الولايات المتحدة تبقى الفاعل الأساسي في ملف العقوبات المفروضة على النظام.

فرص اقتصادية واعدة

من جهته، اعتبر الدكتور خالد تركاوي، الباحث الاقتصادي في مركز جسور للدراسات، أن القرار الأوروبي "فرصة تاريخية" لتعافي الاقتصاد السوري، خاصة بإعادة الاندماج في النظام المالي العالمي، مما يتيح للبنوك السورية استئناف أنشطتها ويُسهّل عمليات التحويل المالي والائتماني.

وأشار تركاوي إلى أن هذا الانفتاح يمكن أن يجذب الاستثمارات الأجنبية، لا سيما في مشاريع إعادة الإعمار، ويساهم في تحسين إيرادات الدولة من التجارة والضرائب، ما يقلل من الاعتماد على المساعدات الخارجية.

إعلان

ولفت إلى أن سوريا تُعد "أرضاً خصبة للاستثمار" في قطاعات الطاقة والنقل والزراعة، موضحاً أن إزالة القيود القانونية والمصرفية سيعزز من جاذبية السوق السورية.

وعلى المستوى المعيشي، يرى تركاوي، أن القرار قد يؤدي إلى انخفاض في أسعار السلع، وتوفير فرص عمل عبر مشاريع إعادة الإعمار، إلى جانب تحسين الخدمات الأساسية كالكهرباء والرعاية الصحية والتعليم، مما قد يشجع على عودة بعض السوريين المغتربين إلى بلادهم.

واختتم تركاوي بالتأكيد على أن استقرار سعر صرف الليرة السورية وتراجع معدلات التضخم سيكونان من أبرز النتائج المتوقعة للقرار الأوروبي، مما يُسهم في خلق بيئة اقتصادية أكثر استقراراً وجاذبية للنمو والتنمية.

خلفية العقوبات الأوروبية

بدأ الاتحاد الأوروبي بفرض عقوبات على النظام السوري في مايو/أيار 2011، مستهدفاً شخصيات وكيانات مرتبطة بعمليات القمع، إلى جانب حظر تصدير الأسلحة والتعامل مع البنك المركزي السوري.

وفي وقت لاحق، توسعت العقوبات لتشمل الرئيس المخلوع بشار الأسد وأفراد أسرته ودائرته المقربة، حيث تم تجميد أصولهم ومنعهم من السفر.

كما شملت العقوبات حظرًا على تصدير النفط والمعادن الثمينة، فضلاً عن قيود متنوعة على التعاملات المالية. وبحلول منتصف عام 2012، كانت قائمة العقوبات قد اتسعت لتضم أكثر من 120 شخصية و40 كياناً، معظمها على صلة مباشرة بالنظام السوري. وكان الهدف المُعلن من هذه العقوبات يتمثل في حرمان النظام من الموارد المالية التي قد تُستخدم في قمع المدنيين، مع الحرص على عدم المساس بالاحتياجات الإنسانية الأساسية للسكان.

أظهرت رسالتان اطلعت عليهما رويترز أن النيجر طلبت من بعض الموظفين الصينيين العاملين في مشروعات نفطية مغادرة البلاد، وهي خطوة قد تؤثر على عشرات العمال وتزيد من التوتر في العلاقات الثنائية.

وشأنها شأن دول أخرى في غرب أفريقيا، تحاول النيجر التي يقودها مجلس عسكري فرض سيطرة أكبر على مواردها الطبيعية وزيادة عدد الموظفين المحليين.

وأوضحت رسالتان أن وزير النفط صحابي عمارو طلب من مؤسسة البترول الوطنية الصينية ومصفاة سوراز التابعة لها إنهاء عقود المغتربين الذين يعملون في النيجر منذ أكثر من 4 سنوات.

وقال متحدث باسم وزارة الخارجية الصينية "التزمت الصين دائما بمبادئ الحقيقة والصداقة والإخلاص والنظرة الواضحة للصواب والمنفعة في تنفيذ التعاون مع أفريقيا"، مضيفا أن مؤسسة البترول الوطنية الصينية قدمت إسهامات اقتصادية واجتماعية في النيجر "لسنوات عديدة".

وتابع المتحدث "ضمان التنمية طويلة الأجل والسليمة للتعاون النفطي بين الصين والنيجر يتماشى مع المصالح المشتركة للطرفين… ويمكن حل المشاكل المحددة التي قد تنشأ من خلال مفاوضات ودية’".

وفي رسالة إلى سوراز بتاريخ 21 مايو/أيار الحالي، أشار عمارو إلى أنه سيكون هناك بعض المرونة، قائلا إنه يتفهم الحاجة إلى إبقاء بعض الموظفين في البلاد وإن قرارات المغادرة ستتخذ على أساس كل حالة على حدة.

إعلان

لكن في رسالة منفصلة إلى الشركة الصينية بتاريخ 20 مايو/أيار الحالي، قال عمارو إنه يرفض عقد اجتماع خاص مع الرئيس التنفيذي للشركة الذي طلب مناقشة التوترات بين الجانبين.

وفي تلك الرسالة، اتهم عمارو أيضا الشركة الصينية بعدم الامتثال للوائح محلية.

وحققت النيجر العام الماضي قفزة كبيرة في إنتاج النفط حيث صدّرت ما يربو على 14 مليون طن عبر ميناء بنين وفقا لأرقام رسمية قدمتها الحكومة.

وقال وزير النفط والطاقة في البلاد وقتها إن عائدات النفط ارتفعت إلى 325 مليون دولار في نهاية 2024.

القدس المحتلة – تتصاعد التوترات التجارية بين إسرائيل وأوروبا بشكل غير مسبوق، في ظل استمرار الحرب على غزة وتفاقم تداعياتها الإنسانية، إذ تبحث كل من بريطانيا والاتحاد الأوروبي في خطوات قد تؤدي إلى تجميد أو إلغاء اتفاقيات تجارية قائمة مع إسرائيل، في تطور ينذر بعواقب اقتصادية وخسائر محتملة تقدَّر بعشرات المليارات من الدولارات.

وفي تطور لافت، أعلنت وزارة الخارجية البريطانية تعليق المفاوضات بشأن اتفاقيةِ تجارة حرة جديدة مع إسرائيل، مشيرة صراحة إلى حكومة بنيامين نتنياهو، في موقف يعكس أبعادا سياسية واضحة تتجاوز الجوانب الاقتصادية.

ويأتي القرار البريطاني في توقيت حساس، إذ كانت الاتفاقية تمثل لإسرائيل فرصة لتعزيز علاقاتها التجارية مع واحدة من أبرز القوى العالمية، لاسيما بعد خروج بريطانيا من الاتحاد الأوروبي. وعلى صعيد أوروبي أوسع، أعلنت مفوضَة الشؤون الخارجية في الاتحاد الأوروبي أن التكتل سيناقش مستقبل اتفاقية التجارة مع إسرائيل.

ورغم أن هذا التوجه أثار قلقا في الأوساط السياسية والاقتصادية داخل إسرائيل، فإن أي تعديل جوهري في الاتفاق القائم مع الاتحاد الأوروبي يستلزم إجماع الدول الأعضاء الـ27، علما أن 17 دولة فقط أبدت حتى الآن تأييدها لإعادة النظر في الاتفاق، مما يقلل من احتمالات التغيير الفوري، لكنه يعكس تحولًا تدريجيًا في المواقف الأوروبية تجاه إسرائيل.

إعلان

ضغوط دولية وتحذيرات داخلية

تأتي هذه التطورات على وقع تزايد الضغوط الدولية على إسرائيل، خصوصا بعد تعثر مفاوضات صفقة تبادل الأسرى نتيجة تشدد موقف حكومة نتنياهو. وفي الداخل الإسرائيلي، تتصاعد الأصوات المطالبة بمراجعة شاملة للمسار العسكري والسياسي في غزة، وسط تحذيرات من تراجع الدعم الدولي وتآكل فاعلية العمليات العسكرية.

وتعد بريطانيا من الشركاء التجاريين المهمين لإسرائيل، فقد بلغت صادرات إسرائيل إلى بريطانيا (باستثناء الماس) في عام 2024 نحو 1.28 مليار دولار، مقارنة بـ1.8 مليار دولار في عام 2023، بحسب صحيفة "غلوبس" الاقتصادية، وتشكل الكيميائيات والأدوية نحو ثلث هذه الصادرات، وهي قطاعات حيوية للاقتصاد الإسرائيلي.

في المقابل، تستورد إسرائيل من بريطانيا ما قيمته نحو 2.5 مليار دولار، بما يعني أن المملكة المتحدة تحقق فائضًا تجاريًا يبلغ 1.3 مليار دولار لصالحها.

أما على مستوى الاتحاد الأوروبي، فهو الشريك التجاري الأكبر لإسرائيل بعد الولايات المتحدة. ففي عام 2024، بلغت صادرات إسرائيل إلى الاتحاد نحو 15.9 مليار يورو، مقابل واردات أوروبية بنحو 26.7 مليار يورو، تتصدرها المواد الكيميائية والآلات.

ثمن باهظ محتمل

يحذر خبراء اقتصاديون من أن استمرار الحرب في غزة قد يترتب عليه ثمن اقتصادي باهظ لإسرائيل. ويرى محللون أن اتفاقية التجارة مع بريطانيا، التي كانت تعد إنجازًا إستراتيجيًا، قد تتحول إلى رمز لفشل سياسي واقتصادي، لا سيما مع الحديث المتزايد عن مقاطعة محتملة تهدد نحو 13.5% من الناتج المحلي الإجمالي الإسرائيلي.

وفي الداخل الإسرائيلي، تتزايد الدعوات إلى صياغة مقترحات سياسية جديدة لإنهاء الحرب وتفادي تداعيات خطيرة على الاقتصاد والمكانة الدولية.

مقاطعة آخذة في الاتساع

يقول كبير المحللين الاقتصاديين في صحيفة "كلكليست" الإسرائيلية أدريان بايلوت إن هذه التطورات لا تقتصر على البعد السياسي، بل تنذر بـ"ثمن اقتصادي يتجاوز 76 مليار دولار"، مع خطر تآكل ما يصل إلى 13.5% من الناتج المحلي الإجمالي.

إعلان

ويضيف أن اتفاقية التجارة الحرة مع بريطانيا، التي كانت مرشحة لأن تصبح نموذجًا يحتذى به، تواجه الآن خطر التجميد أو الإلغاء، مؤكدا أن التصعيد العسكري في غزة، إلى جانب ما تسميه بعض الدول الأوروبية "انتهاك القانون الإنساني الدولي"، دفع شركاء غربيين إلى إعادة تقييم علاقاتهم مع إسرائيل، خصوصا على الصعيد الاقتصادي.

ويرى بايلوت أن الاتفاقيات التجارية التي كانت ركائز أساسية للاقتصاد الإسرائيلي، تحولت إلى أوراق ضغط بيد الأوروبيين، في خضم أزمة تتسع يوما بعد يوم، ويشير إلى أن استمرار الحكومة الإسرائيلية على نهجها الحالي، مع تصاعد العزلة الدولية، يضع البلاد أمام تحد خطير قد يمس ليس فقط بالمؤسسات، بل بالمجتمع الإسرائيلي بأكمله.

ويحذر من أن إسرائيل باتت على مفترق طرق سياسي واقتصادي، مشددا على أن غياب المراجعة السياسية للمسار الحالي قد يؤدي إلى تراجع طويل الأمد في مكانتها الدولية.

فقدان ثقة المستثمرين

من جهته، يرى إيتان أفرئيل، رئيس تحرير صحيفة "ذَ ماركر"، أن الاستمرار في السياسات الحالية تجاه غزة قد يؤدي إلى فقدان الأصول الإسرائيلية المالية لقيمتها السوقية، ويضيف أن الاتهامات المتزايدة لإسرائيل بـ"ارتكاب انتهاكات أخلاقية وسياسية" تقوض ثقة المستثمرين، لافتًا إلى أن صندوق الثروة السيادي النرويجي بدأ بالفعل بيع استثماراته في شركات إسرائيلية.

ويشير إلى أن النقاش الأخلاقي والاقتصادي حول الحرب في غزة يكاد يغيب في الداخل الإسرائيلي، بينما بدأت تداعياته بالظهور خارجيًا، مع تحركات نرويجية وأيرلندية ويابانية لتقليص الاستثمارات، في وقت يدرس فيه الاتحاد الأوروبي إلغاء اتفاقية التجارة، وتعلّق فيه بريطانيا تحديث الاتفاق وتستدعي السفير الإسرائيلي.

ويخلص أفرئيل إلى أن هذه التحركات تشير إلى عزلة اقتصادية متنامية، وأن الأسواق قد تبدأ في تسعير هذه العزلة من خلال خصومات على الأسهم الإسرائيلية وعوائد مرتفعة على السندات، وهو ما سينعكس سلبًا على الاقتصاد.

إعلان

ويحذر من أن السيناريو الجنوب أفريقي إبان نظام الفصل العنصري قد لا يكون بعيدا، إذا استمرت السياسات الحالية، مشيرا إلى احتمال انخفاضات حادة في قيمة العملة، وخصومات تفوق 30%، ورسالة واضحة للمستثمرين بأن الاستثمار في دولة متهمة بجرائم حرب قد يتحول إلى مخاطرة كبرى.

"إن صورة أغنى رجل في العالم وهو يقتل أفقر أطفال العالم ليست جميلة"، قالها مؤسس مايكروسوفت، الملياردير الخيري بيل غيتس عن إيلون ماسك خلال مقابلة مع صحيفة فايننشال تايمز، في وقت سابق من هذا الشهر.

وقد أشار غيتس بشكل غير مباشر إلى دور ماسك في تقويض الوكالة الفدرالية للمساعدات الأميركية للتنمية الدولية (USAID)، وهي الوكالة التي تم توجيه مليارات الدولارات عبرها لعقود نحو الحد من الفقر العالمي، والقضاء على الأمراض.

لكن ذلك تغيّر، عندما قاد ماسك الحملة لإنشاء وزارة الكفاءة الحكومية غير الرسمية التابعة للإدارة الأميركية الحالية (DOGE) لتفكيك الوكالة في فبراير/ شباط.

وقال غيتس في مقابلة لاحقة في برنامج (The Late Show with Stephen Colbert)، موسعًا تعليقاته السابقة: إنّه "ما لم نعكس المسار بسرعة، فإننا سنشهد وفاة أكثر من مليون طفل إضافي حول العالم".

لكن بغضّ النظر عمّا يراه بيل غيتس أو غيره، فإن استخفاف إيلون ماسك بحياة البشر لا يقتصر فقط على دوره في قيادة وزارة الكفاءة الحكومية (DOGE). بل إن هذا النهج الفكري لا يخصّ ماسك وحده، بل يُعبّر عن توجّه أوسع داخل الإدارة الأميركية.

فقد أفسحت الإدارة المجال لنفوذ مجموعة من أنصار فكر "تحسين النسل"، سواء من التيارات القديمة أو بصيغها المعاصرة. ويؤمن بعض هؤلاء بفلسفة تُعرف بـ"المدى الطويل" (longtermism)، والتي تقوم على فكرة أن بقاء البشرية وامتدادها عبر المجرة بمليارات من البشر مستقبلًا يتطلب قيادة نُخبوية تتخذ قرارات صعبة، من بينها التضحية بأعداد كبيرة من البشر المعاصرين لحماية هذا المستقبل البعيد.

إعلان

وضمن هذا السياق، يشارك ماسك وآخرون في توجيه السياسات الأميركية، داخليًا وخارجيًا، على أسس تجمع بين أفكار "تحسين النسل" و"المدى الطويل"، ما يجعل ملايين البشر عرضة لأخطار فعلية أو محتملة.

أبرز رموز تحسين النسل التقليدي في محيط الإدارة الأميركية الحالية

ربما أبرز مثال على فكر تحسين النسل التقليدي، هو روبرت ف. كينيدي الابن، الذي يشغل حاليًا منصب وزير الصحة والخدمات الإنسانية الأميركية (HHS).

وهناك موقفان له يُظهران بوضوح تبنّيه فكرَ تحسين النسل في القرن العشرين. أولهما موقفه المعادي للقاحات على مرّ السنين، خصوصًا لقاح الحصبة والنكاف والحصبة الألمانية (MMR).

ففي التسعينيات، ادعى عدد محدود من العلماء أن هذا اللقاح مسؤول عن ازدياد تشخيص التوحد لدى الأطفال. ورغم أن العديد من الدراسات فنّدت تلك المزاعم، فقد استمر مناهضو اللقاحات أمثال كينيدي في تقويض الثقة العامة في برامج اللقاحات.

وقال كينيدي في عام 2015 عن لقاح MMR: "يتلقون اللقاح، وفي تلك الليلة يصابون بحمى تصل إلى 103 درجات، ينامون، وبعد ثلاثة أشهر يتلف دماغهم. هذه محرقة، ما يفعله هذا الأمر ببلدنا". وقد اعتذر لاحقًا عن مقارنته المهينة بين التوحد والمحرقة.

الموقف الثاني هو نزعة التمييز ضد ذوي الإعاقة لديه، المتداخلة مع نزعة عنصرية. ففي أبريل/ نيسان، انتقد كينيدي ازدياد حالات التوحد في أميركا باعتبارها أمرًا "يدمر العائلات"، مضيفًا أن الأطفال الذين "تراجعوا.. إلى التوحد.. لن يدفعوا ضرائب أبدًا، ولن يعملوا أبدًا، ولن يلعبوا البيسبول، ولن يكتبوا شعرًا، ولن يواعدوا، والكثير منهم لن يستخدموا المرحاض دون مساعدة".

أصرّ كينيدي على تجاهل البيانات العلمية التي تؤكد أن التوحد ليس مرضًا في طور الانتشار، بل إن المجتمع بات يمتلك أدوات أدق وأكثر تطورًا تساعد على تشخيص من هم ضمن طيف التوحد، وهم أشخاص يشارك كثير منهم في الحياة الاجتماعية والعقلية بشكل نشط.

إعلان

وفي السياق نفسه، روّج كينيدي عام 2023 لشائعة مناهضة للقاحات تنطوي على مضمون عنصري وتمييزي ونزعة تآمرية. ففي يوليو/ تموز من ذلك العام، وخلال فعالية لجمع التبرعات لحملته الرئاسية التي أُلغيت لاحقًا، ظهر في مقطع مصوّر زاعمًا أن "كوفيد-19 يستهدف البيض والسود، بينما يتمتع اليهود الأشكناز والصينيون بأعلى درجات المناعة".

غير أن هذا الادعاء يفتقر تمامًا إلى أي دليل علمي؛ فلا توجد مؤامرة تستهدف أعراقًا بعينها، كما لا توجد فئة سكانية محصّنة من الفيروس بطبيعتها. ومن الواضح أن تصريحات كينيدي العنصرية تنطوي أيضًا على معاداة للسامية.

استخدام بيانات خاصة لأهداف تحسين النسل

في وقت سابق من هذا الشهر، أعلن كينيدي أنه خوّل برنامجَي "ميديكيد" و"ميديكير" بمشاركة البيانات الخاصة مع معاهد الصحة الوطنية (NIH) لإنشاء قاعدة بيانات وطنية للمصابين بالتوحد "لكشف الأسباب الجذرية للتوحد" – والذي يعتبره "مرضًا يمكن الوقاية منه"- بحلول سبتمبر/ أيلول. ويتجاوز هذا التصريح مجرّد الرأي ليذكّر بممارسات دعاة تحسين النسل في القرن الماضي.

فقد استخدمت حكومات الولايات الأميركية، والحكومات الفاشية مثل النازية، مثل هذه القوائم لعزل المصابين بالتوحد وغيرهم من ذوي الإعاقات عن المجتمع.

في الولايات المتحدة، كانت التعقيم القسري الوسيلة لحماية "نقاء الجينات"، بينما استخدم النازيون القتل الرحيم. من الواضح أن كينيدي يمثل نموذجًا تقليديًا لداعية تحسين نسل معادٍ للقاحات ولذوي الإعاقة وعنصري في آنٍ واحد.

تحسين النسل الجديد: فلسفة المدى الطويل

غير أن فكر "تحسين النسل" في القرن الحادي والعشرين لم يختفِ، بل أعاد إنتاج نفسه في صورة جديدة تُعرف بفلسفة "المدى الطويل" (Longtermism). هذه الفلسفة تُعد امتدادًا حديثًا لمبادئ "الداروينية الاجتماعية" و"البقاء للأصلح" والحركات الإقصائية التي نشأت عنها.

وعلى الرغم من أنها لا تروّج صراحة لفكرة الحفاظ على "عرق أبيض متفوق"، فإنها تتقاطع بوضوح مع منطق تحسين النسل. يؤمن أنصار "المدى الطويل" بأن إنقاذ البشرية من الانقراض يكمن في تطوير الإنسان ذاته وخلق "بشرٍ أفضل" قادرين على حمل مشعل الحضارة نحو المستقبل البعيد.

إعلان

لكن هذا "التحسين" يرتكز على فرضيتين أساسيتين: الأولى أن الرجال البيض من أصحاب الثروة والنفوذ -مثل إيلون ماسك، وبيل غيتس، وجيف بيزوس- هم الأجدر باتخاذ القرارات المصيرية نيابة عن البشرية جمعاء.

والثانية أن عليهم أن يُحدّدوا مَن مِن البشر يُمكنه الاستمرار في استخدام موارد الكوكب، ومن يُفترض التضحية به، إذ يُنظر إلى مليارات من البشر الحاليين على أنهم عقبة محتملة في وجه "مستقبل أفضل" يستحق -في نظرهم- إنقاذه حتى لو تطلب الأمر إقصاءهم.

ماسك ونظرية "الانتحار الحضاري عبر التعاطف"

كشف ماسك عن قناعته العميقة بشأن من يستحق الحياة ومن لا يستحقها خلال مقابلة مطوّلة استمرت ثلاث ساعات في بودكاست جو روغن في فبراير/ شباط. قال ماسك حينها: "نحن نعيش حالة من التعاطف الانتحاري على مستوى الحضارة.. الضعف الجوهري في الحضارة الغربية يكمن في التعاطف. إنه استغلال للتعاطف. إنهم يستغلون ثغرة في الحضارة الغربية، وهي الاستجابة العاطفية".

وبحسب رؤيته، فإن أولئك الذين لا يظهرون تعاطفًا مع "الحضارة ككل" -أي من منظور شامل وبارد- يساهمون، في رأيه، في انتحارها الجماعي.

أما "هم" الذين يشير إليهم ماسك وروغن طوال المقابلة، فهم فئات متعددة تشمل: المهاجرين غير النظاميين، الليبراليين البيض، التقدميين، أعضاء الحزب الديمقراطي، وغيرهم من أفراد مجتمع الميم.

الضمان الاجتماعي وسياسات شيخوخية قاسية

في دائرة أنصار فلسفة "المدى الطويل"، يبرز اسم الملياردير التقني بيتر ثييل، الذي يصف نظام الضمان الاجتماعي الأميركي بأنه "احتيال بين الأجيال".

هذا التصريح يعكس دعمه الصريح لسياسات ماسك في إطار وزارة الكفاءة الحكومية (DOGE)، التي تستهدف تقليص برامج الرعاية الاجتماعية، لا سيما تلك المخصصة لكبار السن.

كما يُظهر ذلك توجه الإدارة الأميركية نحو تبنّي سياسات تتسم بالتمييز العمري والوظيفي، تحت غطاء "تقليص الإنفاق الحكومي"، بينما تُعد هذه السياسات في جوهرها امتدادًا لفكر تحسين النسل، حيث يجري التلميح -أو التمهيد- لإقصاء الفئات التي تُعتبر عبئًا اقتصاديًا أو غير منتجة، مثل المسنين وذوي الإعاقات. وهي مقاربة قد تفضي فعليًا إلى تعريض هذه الفئات للهلاك.

إعلان

إعادة تشكيل الحكومة الفدرالية على صورة دعاة تحسين النسل

عمل كينيدي وماسك على إعادة تشكيل الحكومة الفدرالية على صورتهم الخاصة كدعاة تحسين نسل. وقد تعاون كينيدي مع DOGE التابعة لماسك لقطع التمويل عن وزارة الصحة والخدمات الإنسانية، ومعاهد الصحة الوطنية، وبرامج اللقاحات، والوقاية من الأوبئة، وأبحاث السرطان، منذ توليه منصبه في منتصف فبراير/ شباط.

وهناك حاليًا أمر حظر فعلي يمنع مسؤولي مراكز مكافحة الأمراض من التحدث عن انتشار سلالات إنفلونزا الطيور بين الحيوانات والبشر العاملين في صناعة الدواجن.

وعندما تم استجوابه في جلسة استماع بالكونغرس في 14 مايو/ أيار حول عمله كوزير للصحة في تفكيك الوزارة، اعترف كينيدي بأنه "ربما" سيلقّح أطفاله ضد الحصبة في عام 2025.

لكنه، في الجلسة ذاتها، عاد وشكّك في لقاح MMR، مما يشير إلى موقفه المتحيز ضد الأشخاص المصابين بالتوحد، بينما تمر الولايات المتحدة، وتحديدًا ولاية تكساس، بأحد أسوأ تفشيات الحصبة خلال الخمسين عامًا الماضية، حيث سُجل أكثر من ألف حالة حتى الآن، معظمها بين الأطفال غير الملقحين، توفي منهم اثنان.

أشهرت العديد من الدول الأوروبية مواقفَ ضد استمرار العدوان الإسرائيلي على قطاع غزة، وطالبت بوقف الحرب وإدخال المساعدات فورًا، رافضة بشدّة سياسة التجويع التي ملأت أخبارها أركان المعمورة.

بريطانيا علّقت مفاوضاتها بشأن التجارة الحرّة مع إسرائيل، وفرضت عقوبات على أفراد وكيانات تشجّع الاستيطان في الضفة الغربية، في 20 أيار/ مايو الجاري، مهدّدة على لسان رئيس وزرائها كير ستارمر ووزير خارجيتها ديفيد لامي بفرض عقوبات جديدة خلال الأيام والأسابيع القادمة إن لم تستجب إسرائيل لدعواتها بإدخال المساعدات فورًا.

الموقف البريطاني جاء بعد بيان مشترك لبريطانيا وفرنسا وكندا شديد اللهجة، مهدّدًا "باتخاذ إجراءات إذا لم توقف إسرائيل هجومها على غزة وترفع القيود على المساعدات"، مؤكّدًا على أنهم "لن يقفوا مكتوفي الأيدي بينما تواصل حكومة نتنياهو أفعالها الفاضحة".

وفي نفس السياق، صوّت الاتحاد الأوروبي في 20 أيار/ مايو، بأغلبية 17 صوتًا من أصل 27 على مراجعة اتّفاقية الشراكة مع إسرائيل، وفقًا لمعايير القانون الدولي، وحقوق الإنسان، ما يفتح الباب على احتمال فرض عقوبات لاحقًا.

هذا، بالإضافة إلى تصديق البرلمان الإسباني على النظر في مقترح حظر تجارة الأسلحة مع إسرائيل، وإعلان فرنسا على لسان رئيس وزرائها فرانسوا بايرو؛ بأن حركة الاعتراف بدولة فلسطين لن تتوقف، في إشارة إلى عزم فرنسا وبريطانيا وكندا الاعتراف بدولة فلسطين.

صحوّة أوروبية متأخّرة

صحيح أنّ المواقف الأوروبية جاءت متأخّرة جدًا، وما زالت تتحاشى وصف ما يجري في قطاع غزة بالتطهير العرقي والإبادة الجماعية وجرائم الحرب، لكنها مهمّة لأنها صادرة عن دول صديقة وراعية لإسرائيل تاريخيًا.

وهي دول لطالما لاحقت كل ناقد لسياسات إسرائيل العنصرية وانتهاكاتها للقوانين الدولية وحقوق الإنسان بذريعة معاداة السامية، ما يشكّل تحولًا في مواقف تلك الدولة وفشلًا للرواية الإسرائيلية المبنية على المظلومية، وتهاوي سرديتها الاحتلالية المبنية على مبدأ الدفاع عن النفس والدفاع عن الحضارة والنور، في مواجهة محور الشر والظلام، فأصبحت إسرائيل اليوم في عيون أصدقائها ورعاتها قاتلة للأطفال، ومرتكبة لانتهاكات مروّعة بحق المدنيين العزّل.

هذا التغيّر في المواقف دفع مصدرًا في الخارجية الإسرائيلية للتعليق على الموضوع لصحيفة يديعوت أحرونوت في 21 أيار/ مايو بالقول؛ "نحن أمام أسوأ وضع مررنا به على الإطلاق والعالم ليس معنا.. نحن أمام تسونامي حقيقي سيزداد سوءًا".

على أهمية المواقف الأوروبية تلك، فإنها لم ترقَ بعد إلى مستوى الفعل والترجمة إلى إجراءات قويّة وعقوبات مؤثّرة اقتصاديًا وعسكريًا على إسرائيل لوقف الإبادة الجماعية وسياسة التجويع المتوحّشة بحق الأطفال والمدنيين العزّل في غزة، وهذا استحقاق سياسي وأخلاقي لا بد منه إذا أرادت الدول الأوروبية أن تستعيد جزءًا من مصداقيتها التي سقطت بدعمها إسرائيل، وبصمتها على جرائمها طوال 19 شهرًا، والتي ارتقت إلى حد الإبادة الجماعية المتوحّشة.

دون اتخاذ الدول الأوروبية عقوبات جادّة وثقيلة توقف جرائم إسرائيل وتوقف عدوانها على غزة؛ ستكون تلك المواقف مجرّد وسيلة مكشوفة لتبرئة الذات أمام الرأي العام الدولي، لأن الجميع يعرف قدرات الاتحاد الأوروبي على الضغط على إسرائيل، فالاتحاد الأوروبي أكبر وأهم شريك لإسرائيل وفقًا لاتفاقية الشراكة الموقعة بينهما منذ العام 1995، والتي دخلت حيّز التنفيذ في 1 يونيو/ جزيران 2000.

إعلان

وتعد هذه الاتفاقية مجالًا للتعاون المشترك بينهما في السياسة، والتنمية الاقتصادية، والتبادل التجاري، والتعاون العلمي والتكنولوجي، والثقافة، وتعتبر احترام حقوق الإنسان جزءًا أساسيًا من بنودها.

وفي سياق التفسير لأسباب هذا التحوّل في الموقف الأوروبي تجاه إسرائيل ونتنياهو، يمكن الإشارة إلى عدة مسائل أهمها:

أن إسرائيل فشلت في مقاربتها العسكرية، ولا يوجد أفق لنجاح هذه المقاربة رغم وحشيتها، علاوة على أن حكومة نتنياهو المتطرفة ما زالت تصرّ على استمرار العدوان على قطاع غزة بهدف تهجير الفلسطينيين، كما جاء بشكل واضح وجلي على لسان وزير المالية بتسلئيل سموتريتش، ما يجعل أفق الصراع غامضًا ومربكًا لكافة الأطراف، وربما يحمل في طياته مع طول الزمن اضطرابات شرق أوسطية، واضطرابات داخل بعض الدول العربية؛ بسبب الاحتقان المتعاظم لدى الشعوب العربية، ما يُقلق الأوروبيين شركاء العرب في حوض البحر الأبيض المتوسط، الذي لم يهدأ منذ "الربيع العربي" 2011.

تحوّل العدوان الصهيوني على غزة إلى حالة من العبث بأرواح المدنيين والأطفال قتلًا وتجويعًا، ما شكّل حرجًا للحكومات الغربية أمام شعوبها التي لم تهدأ في رفضها العدوان والإبادة والتجويع، وخاصة في أهم الدول الأوروبية مثل ألمانيا وفرنسا، وهولندا، والنرويج، ويلجيكا، وبريطانيا التي شهدت يوم السبت الماضي 17 أيار/ مايو مسيرة شارك فيها نحو نصف مليون بريطاني وبريطانية.

استمرار التوحّش الإسرائيلي وارتكاب جيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي أبشع الفظائع ضد المدنيين والأطفال، يهدّد السلطة الأخلاقية للمنظومة الغربية التي لطالما تغنّت بها مقارنة بالدول الأخرى، واستخدمتها في الضغط على أنظمة بعينها، ولذلك فإن الاستدراك الأوروبي من باب القانون الدولي وحقوق الإنسان يعدّ محاولة، ولو متأخرة، لإنقاذ صورة المنظومة الغربية، ولاسترداد مصداقيتها أمام العالم وشعوبها الناقدة والناقمة على إسرائيل؛ بسبب وحشيتها وارتكابها إبادة جماعية وتجويعًا لأكثر من مليونَي إنسان في قطاع غزة.

الموقف الأوروبي يستمد قوّته أيضًا من توجه الإدارة الأميركية لوقف إطلاق النار في غزة، وحدوث تباين في الموقف الأميركي مع إسرائيل في معالجة الملف النووي الإيراني عبر المفاوضات، وانسحاب واشنطن من الاشتباك مع الحوثيين في اليمن، ورفع العقوبات الأميركية عن سوريا، فذلك يجعل المواقف الأوروبية تتقاطع مع رغبة أميركية لوقف الحرب على غزة، وهو ما يفسّر امتناع واشنطن عن انتقاد تلك المواقف، ما يعد قبولًا ضمنيًا لها.

إعلان

فرصة عربية

التغيّر في الموقف الأوروبي يوفّر فرصة سانحة للدول العربية، لانتهازها في تفعيل مواقفها ضد إسرائيل المحتلة وحربها المجنونة والعبثية في قطاع غزة.

الدول العربية تملك أوراقًا مهمّة وقوّية يمكن أن تشكل عاملًا حاسمًا لوقف الإبادة الجماعية، ومن ثم رفع الحصار، والبدء بالإعمار وفقًا للخطة العربية.

فكما بدأ الاتحاد الأوروبي بالتهديد والشروع في إجراءات تدريجية، يمكن أن يفعل العرب ذلك وأكثر؛ بوقف التطبيع وقطع العلاقات السياسية ووقف كافة الشراكات الأمنية والاقتصادية إذا لم توقف إسرائيل العدوان وحرب الإبادة على غزة وفتح المعابر لدخول المساعدات فورًا، فبريطانيا ليست أولى بفلسطين من العرب، أهل الجوار والعمق الإستراتيجي لفلسطين.

وإذا كان البعض يخشى من ردة فعل واشنطن، فهذا انتفى الآن قياسًا على صمت واشنطن على المواقف الأوروبية الناقدة والمهدّدة لإسرائيل بالعقوبات في أقرب الآجال، هذا ناهيك عن إعراب واشنطن عن رغبتها في وقف الحرب وإشاعة السلام في المنطقة.

وليس أسوأ على المنطقة من استمرار العدوان على غزة، وتهجير الشعب الفلسطيني، فهذه وصفة باعثة للاضطراب ومهدّدة لأمن المنطقة وسلامتها، ولذلك يصبح التحرّك الآن أكثر جدوى وأقدر على حماية المنطقة العربية من عبث إسرائيل المحتلة التي ترى في الصمت العربي تشجيعًا لها على التمادي والغطرسة، واستمرار العدوان على غزة والضفة الغربية، وسوريا، ولبنان.

الدول العربية تملك الإمكانات والقدرة على ممارسة الضغط المباشر على إسرائيل المحتلة، كما أن تفعيل أوراق قوّتها سيحفّز واشنطن ويدفع الرئيس ترامب أيضًا لحسم موقفه بوقف العدوان على غزة ومنع تهجير الفلسطينيين، وفي ذلك حماية للقضية الفلسطينية وأمن المنطقة وسلامتها من شرّ إسرائيل وغطرستها المنفلتة من عقالها.

الآراء الواردة في المقال لا تعكس بالضرورة الموقف التحريري لشبكة الجزيرة.

عندما قصفت إسرائيل مجمع ناصر الطبي في خان يونس يوم 13 مايو/أيار، اغتالت الصحفي الفلسطيني المعروف حسن إصليح. كانت تلك هي المرة الثانية التي تستهدفه فيها.

فقد سبق أن تعرّض لهجوم في السابع من أبريل/ نيسان، عندما قصفت إسرائيل خيمة الصحفيين خارج مستشفى ناصر، ما أدى إلى استشهاد الصحفي أحمد منصور.

نجا حسن من هجوم أبريل/ نيسان، لكن بعد شهر، وأثناء تلقيه العلاج في سرير المستشفى من حروق شديدة وفقدانه إصبعين، قضى عليه الانفجار الثاني الذي دمّر أيضًا وحدة الحروق في المستشفى.

تباهى جيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي بأن حسن كان الهدف في الهجومين، زاعمًا أنه مقاتل في حماس "يتخفى في زي صحفي". وهي المزاعم الكاذبة ذاتها التي اعتادت إسرائيل إطلاقها كلما أقدمت على تصفية صحفي في غزة، لم تكن هذه سوى كذبتها الجديدة.

كتب رايان غريم، الشريك المؤسس لموقع "دروب سايت نيوز"، ردًا على "التصريحات الجنونية الصادرة عن جيش الاحتلال"، واصفًا مزاعم إسرائيل بأنها "سلوك نفسي منحرف موضوعيًا".

وزعم جيش الاحتلال أنه قصف المستشفى؛ لأن "مسؤولًا ماليًا في حكومة حماس، سبق اغتياله، كان يعمل في المستشفى خلال شهر مارس/ آذار". واعتبرت إسرائيل أن ذلك سبب كافٍ"لقصف المستشفى في مايو/ أيار". وكما أكد غريم: "للتوضيح، فإن وجود موظفين حكوميين في مستشفى لا يجعله هدفًا مشروعًا قانونيًا أو أخلاقيًا. لا سيما بعد أشهر من ذلك".

إعلان

وأضاف: "قصف وحدة الحروق لاغتيال صحفي بارز يرقد فيها بسبب قصفكم خيمته يمثل انحدارًا غير مسبوق. عدد قليل جدًا من الحكومات خلال المئة عام الماضية تجرأت على ارتكاب جرائم من هذا النوع، وأقل منها من تجرأ على فعلها تحت أنظار العالم".

انتشرت على وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي تحيات مؤثرة لروح حسن، منها منشور للصحفي أبي بكر عابد جاء فيه: "وداعًا لبطل قتلته إسرائيل لمجرد أنه كان صحفيًا".

وفوق صورة لحسن مرتديًا سترته وخوذته التي تحمل شعار "PRESS"، ويتطلع بنظرة حادة إلى الكاميرا، كتب صحفي آخر: "لقد اغتالتك إسرائيل يا حسن.. قتلوك لأن صوتك كان عاليًا جدًا.. قويًا جدًا".

وقد لفت هذا المنشور انتباه منظمة ضغط صهيونية تُدعى "Honest Reporting"، وهو اسم يُعدّ من أكثر الأسماء تهكمًا وسخرية لمنظمة أُنشئت خصيصا لفبركة الروايات، وفرض الرقابة على الصحافة.

تأسست المنظمة عام 2006 على يد جو هيامز، المتحدث المسجل باسم السفارة الإسرائيلية في الولايات المتحدة، وقد عملت بشكل سري على مهاجمة كل من ينتقد إسرائيل، لا سيما الصحفيين في غزة. وتبين لاحقًا أن لها دورًا كبيرًا في مقتل حسن.

نشرت "Honest Reporting" تغريدة جاء فيها: "لا عدد الكاميرات ولا سترات الصحافة ولا الخوذ يمكن أن تخفي من هو حسن الأصليح". وزعمت أن حسن "عمل بشكل وثيق مع حماس لترويج دعايتها الإرهابية".

وكان هذا المنشور تحريضًا مباشرًا على القتل، حيث كتب مستخدم يدعى "ballofworms" تعليقًا قال فيه: إن الصحفي الذي دافع عن حسن أصبح "هدفًا مشروعًا"، ودعا جيش الاحتلال الإسرائيلي: "افعلوا ما يجب عليكم فعله".

منذ 7 أكتوبر/ تشرين الأول، دأبت هذه المنظمة على اتهام حسن وغيره من الصحفيين بأنهم عناصر في حماس، لمجرد أنهم وثّقوا ما حدث في ذلك اليوم.

وقد اتّهمت المنظّمة وكالات: رويترز، وأسوشيتد برس، وسي إن إن، وحتى صحيفة نيويورك تايمز، باستخدام صور من 7 أكتوبر/ تشرين الأول، زعمت أنها صادرة عن حماس.

إعلان

ردّت رويترز وأسوشيتد برس بقوة، وأجرت رويترز تحقيقًا مستقلًا خلص إلى أنه "لا يوجد أي دليل يدعم مزاعم التنسيق مع حماس". ووصفت المنظمة بأنها تنشر "ادعاءات غير مسؤولة".

وقد أوضح مدير رويترز التنفيذي جيل هوفمان أن مثل هذه "الإيحاءات" تمثل خطرًا على سلامة الصحفيين في غزة، مضيفًا: "نؤمن بأن Honest Reporting، يجب أن تُحاسب على نشرها المعلومات المضللة، وعلى المخاطر والضرر اللذين لحقا بمصداقية وسلامة الصحفيين العاملين في تغطية هذا الصراع".

وفي الولايات المتحدة، تتحمل منظمات إسرائيلية أخرى مسؤولية غير متناسبة عن اعتقال واحتجاز الطلاب الأجانب المعارضين للإبادة الجماعية، والمقيمين في أميركا.

فمثلًا، منظمة "بيتار أميركا " "Betar USA"، وهي منظمة ذات توجهات فاشية، ومنظمة "Canary Mission" التي وصفتها مجلة "The Nation" بأنها "حملة واسعة النطاق للتشهير والتجسس مصدرها إسرائيل"، تستهدف الطلاب والأساتذة المنتقدين لإسرائيل، وتوجه لهم تهمًا افترائية تهدف إلى "الإضرار بفرصهم المستقبلية في العمل".

وفي عام 2018، كشفت صحيفة The Forward أن مؤسسة Helen Diller Family Foundation خصصت سرًا 100 ألف دولار لصالح "Canary Mission"، من خلال "الصندوق المركزي لإسرائيل" (CFI)، وهي منظمة خيرية مقرها نيويورك، تعمل كوسيط للتبرعات السرية المعفاة من الضرائب، التي يقدمها أثرياء أميركيون لدعم الجماعات المتطرفة في إسرائيل.

وقد كُشف مؤخرًا في وثائق محكمة أن "بيتار" و"Canary Mission" هما الجهتان اللتان تقفان خلف القوائم التي استخدمتها وزارة الخارجية الأميركية لاحتجاز الطلاب المنتقدين لإسرائيل. ففي 8 أبريل/نيسان 2025، نشر حساب "بيتار" تغريدة تتضمن ملفًا شخصيًا من موقع "Canary Mission" لطالب تركي يُدعى إيفي إيرجيليك، وجاء في التغريدة: "لقد حددنا هذا الشخص الحاصل على تأشيرة، وقدمنا اسمه للترحيل.

إعلان

هناك الكثير من هؤلاء الأوغاد في أنحاء البلاد، لكنه حالة متطرفة في ولاية ماساتشوستس الفاسدة". ووفقًا للمحامي المتخصص في الهجرة آرون رايشلين- ميلنيك، فإن إدارة ترامب جردت هذا الطالب من تأشيرته "لأن بيتار غردت عنه".

وبعد 48 ساعة فقط من تلك التغريدة، أصدرت السلطات مذكرة توقيف بحق الطالب "استنادًا إلى كذبة صريحة". وأكدت أوراق الدعوى أن وزارة الأمن الداخلي استخدمت تغريدة "بيتار" للموافقة على احتجاز إيفي إيرجيليك.

وبعد أن قدّم محامون في ولاية ماساتشوستس التماسًا للمحكمة، أمر القاضي بالإفراج عن الطالب، مؤكدًا أن "الاحتجاز تم بناء على تحريض شبه حصري من منظمة بيتار العالمية".

وصدرت هذه الأحكام استنادًا إلى أن اعتقال الطالب كان غير دستوري، لأن "أنشطته" و"خطابه" محميان بموجب التعديل الأول الذي يكفل حرية التعبير. حتى الآن، تأثرت أوضاع الهجرة لـ1.800 طالب في 280 مؤسسة تعليمية، وتم إلغاء العديد من تأشيراتهم.

كتبت منصة Mondoweiss تأبينًا لحسن ونقلت عنه قوله: "قد يستهدفونني داخل المستشفى، في غرفتي هذه. ماذا عساي أن أفعل؟ أنا لا أقاتل. أنا أعمل، وأنا مسؤول عن مهنتي.. وإذا قتلني الجيش الإسرائيلي، فإن الصور التي التقطتها والقصص التي رويتها للعالم ستظل حية. اسمي وقضيتي وصوتي سيبقى حيًا – أما الاحتلال فسيزول".

نعم، الاحتلال سيزول، لأن الطلاب والنشطاء لن يرضخوا أو يتراجعوا عن التنديد بالإبادة الجماعية. وفي ظل القمع الشديد للحراك الطلابي في الجامعات، يخوض عدد من الطلاب حاليًا إضرابات عن الطعام تضامنًا مع الفلسطينيين.

فقد بدأ نحو عشرين طالبًا في كاليفورنيا إضرابًا عن الطعام في 5 مايو/أيار، للفت الانتباه إلى المجاعة المفتعلة في غزة، وكتبوا: "نحن طلاب جامعات سان فرانسيسكو، وساكرامنتو، ولونغ بيتش، وسان خوسيه الحكومية، نبدأ اليوم إضرابًا جماعيًا عن الطعام تضامنًا مع مليونَي فلسطيني مهددين بالمجاعة في غزة"، بحسب ما أعلنت حركة "طلاب من أجل العدالة في فلسطين". وفي 11 مايو/ أيار، انضم ستة طلاب من جامعة ييل إلى الإضراب.

إعلان

وبحلول يوم الاثنين، انتقل الاحتجاج إلى جامعة ستانفورد، حيث شارك ما لا يقل عن 10 طلاب و3 من أعضاء هيئة التدريس. وقد بدأت هذه التحركات تُثمر؛ إذ أعلن طلاب جامعة ولاية سان فرانسيسكو إنهاء إضرابهم بعد التوصل إلى اتفاق مع إدارة الجامعة.

وفي نيويورك، بتاريخ 15 مايو/ أيار، ألقى الطالب الشجاع لوغان روزوس من جامعة نيويورك NYU كلمة في حفل تخرجه وسط تصفيق حار، قال فيها: "أتحدث إلى كل ذي ضمير.. إلى من يشعر بالألم الأخلاقي إزاء هذه الفظائع.. أدين هذه الإبادة الجماعية وكل من يتواطأ فيها". وفي محاولة انتقامية بائسة، قرّرت إدارة الجامعة حجب شهادته، لكن هذه المسرحية الجبانة سرعان ما ستنكشف، وستُفضح باعتبارها فعلًا منافقًا ومخزيًا.

قام الرئيس الأميركي دونالد ترامب، خلال مايو/أيار الجاري، بجولة في الشرق الأوسط شملت السعودية وقطر والإمارات، في تحوّل ملحوظ عن تحالفه غير المحدود في ولايته الرئاسية الأولى مع رئيس وزراء الكيان الصهيوني بنيامين نتنياهو.

ففي الأيام التي سبقت الزيارة، قام ترامب بالتفاوض على وقف لإطلاق النار مع الحوثيين دون أن يطلب من اليمن وقف هجماته على الأهداف الإسرائيلية، كما أنه سمح بإجراء محادثات مباشرة مع حركة حماس التي تعهد فيها بإدخال مساعدات إنسانيّة عاجلة إلى غزة مقابل إطلاق سراح أسير مزدوج الجنسيّة، حيث يحمل الجنسية الأميركية بجانب الإسرائيلية.

هذه التحركات الأميركية، التي جاءت رغم معارضة إسرائيلية شديدة، استطاعت أن تزعزع افتراضات وتهزّ قناعات راسخة منذ زمن طويل بشأن متانة العلاقة الإستراتيجية بين واشنطن وتل أبيب، وهو جدل طالما شغل المؤرّخين والأكاديميين وخبراء العلاقات الدولية لعقود.

من جهة، يرى البعض أن العلاقة بين الطرفين تقوم على تلاعب اللوبي الصهيوني بالنظام السياسي الأميركي من أجل خدمة مصالح الكيان الإسرائيلي.

في هذا الطرح قدّم العالمان السياسيان جون ميرشايمر، وستيفن والت حجة قوية مؤيدة لهذا الرأي في كتابهما المهم "اللوبي الإسرائيلي والسياسة الخارجية الأميركية" (The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy)، حيث استشهدا بالعديد من الأمثلة التي امتدت على مدى عقود تُظهر النفوذ القوي للوبي الصهيوني في الولايات المتحدة، خصوصًا في مدى تأثيره على صنّاع القرار والطبقة السياسية في الكونغرس – من كلا الحزبين الكبيرين – وكذلك على الإدارات الأميركية المتعاقبة.

إعلان

فعلى سبيل المثال، يشير الكتاب إلى تأثير اللوبي الصهيوني والمحافظين الجدد – الذين يفضلون في معظم الأحيان الأولويات والمصالح الإسرائيلية – على إدارة الرئيس جورج بوش الابن خلال فترة التحضير لغزو العراق بعد هجمات 11 سبتمبر/ أيلول 2001.

علاوة على ذلك، فإنه من الصعب جدًا إن لم يكن من المستحيل تفسير التورط العميق للولايات المتحدة فيما يسمى بـ"الحرب الكونية على الإرهاب" وتغيير الأنظمة في الشرق الأوسط لأكثر من عقدين من خلال جدلية المصالح الأميركية البحتة أو الدوافع الجيوسياسية وحدها. ولذا، فإنه مما لا شك فيه أن الكيان الصهيوني قد لعب دورًا رئيسًا في الترويج لهذه السياسات وتعزيزها.

في كتابه "القوة اليهودية" (Jewish Power)، يشرح الصحفي ج. ج. غولدبرغ جوهر قوة اللوبي الصهيوني اليهودي في تعزيز المصالح الإسرائيلية.

كما تم دراسة هذا التأثير بشكل معمق في كتاب حديث للمؤرخ الإسرائيلي إيلان بابيه، والذي تتبع تلاعب وسطوة اللوبي الصهيوني على الساسة الأميركيين والبريطانيين، وتأثير ذلك على السياسة الخارجية في كل من الولايات المتحدة والمملكة المتحدة لأكثر من قرن.

وعلى العكس من ذلك، أكد المؤلف والمفكر الأميركي نعوم تشومسكي في العديد من كتبه أن الولايات المتحدة هي التي تتحكم وتوجه الكيان الصهيوني لخدمة مصالحها الجيوسياسية في الشرق الأوسط.

في هذا السياق، يُعتبر الكيان الإسرائيلي مجرد أداة ضمن مجموعة الأدوات الأميركية الأوسع لضمان الهيمنة الأميركية والتحكم الإمبريالي في هذه المنطقة، بل وعبر العالم أجمع.

وهناك بالفعل سوابق تاريخية تدعم هذا الرأي. واحدة منها تعود إلى العدوان الثلاثي على مصر عام 1956 من قبل الكيان الإسرائيلي وفرنسا والمملكة المتحدة، حيث أمر الرئيس الأميركي دوايت أيزنهاور حينها الكيان الإسرائيلي بالانسحاب من سيناء قبل أسبوع من إعادة انتخابه.

إعلان

والمثال الآخر كان أيام حرب الخليج عام 1991، حيث طالبت الولايات المتحدة الكيان الإسرائيلي بعدم الرد على هجمات صواريخ سكود العراقية أثناء الحرب لتجنب إحراج حلفائها العرب.

لذلك، فإن السؤال الأكبر في هذه المرحلة يتلخّص في تحديد الطرف الذي يوجّه الآخر. هذا الأمر ليس فقط مهمًا للإجابة عن السؤال، بل إنه أيضًا ضروري في إيجاد تفسير أو تحليل يسعى لفهم كيفية تطور الأحداث في المراحل الحاسمة في منطقتَي غرب آسيا، وشمال أفريقيا.

بعبارة أخرى، فإن السؤال الجوهري هو: هل إسرائيل هي من يمسك بخيوط السياسة الأميركية، ويحرك صانعها كما يشاء؟ أم إنها هي الدمية التي تتحرك بخيوط أميركية؟

خلال حملة الإبادة الجماعية التي شنّها الكيان الصهيوني منذ أكتوبر/ تشرين الأول 2023، دعمت الولايات المتحدة هذا الكيان بالكامل – حيث زوّدته بأكثر الأسلحة فتكًا، وبتمويل غير محدود، وبغطاء سياسي وحماية دبلوماسية – مما تسبب في إحداث أضرار واسعة النطاق لسمعتها ومكانتها كقوّة عظمى رئيسة مسؤولة عن الحفاظ على الاستقرار الإقليمي، ومؤسّسات النظام الدولي.

رغم أنه من العبث إنكار قوّة تأثير اللوبي الصهيوني على سياسة الولايات المتحدة في الشرق الأوسط، فإنّ مسألة تقدير من يقود الآخر على مستوى القرارات الحاسمة الكبرى، لا تزال على جانب كبير من عدم اليقين، خاصة في ضوء التحولات السياسية الأخيرة للرئيس دونالد ترامب.

بدأ ترامب فترته الثانية ليس فقط كشخص معروف بسياسته المتوافقة مع الرؤى الصهيونيّة، بل كالرئيس الأكثر تأييدًا للكيان الإسرائيليّ في تاريخ الولايات المتحدة.

ففي خلال ولايته الأولى (2017-2021)، اعترف ترامب بالقدس عاصمة للكيان – متحديًا عقودًا من السياسة الأميركية المعلنة – بل وأتم نقل السفارة الأميركية خلال عهده إلى القدس. واعترف حينها أيضًا بسيادة الكيان الإسرائيلي على هضبة الجولان السورية، وهو ما مثّل انتهاكًا فاضحًا آخر للقانون الدولي.

إعلان

علاوة على ذلك، أضعفت سياسات ترامب المنحازة، السلطةَ الفلسطينية بشدة من خلال إغلاق مكتب منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية في واشنطن وقطع معظم المساعدات الأميركية عن السلطة الفلسطينية، والمنظمات غير الحكومية الفلسطينية، وكذلك الجمعيّات الخيرية الأميركية والدولية بما في ذلك وكالات الأمم المتحدة التي تخدم اللاجئين الفلسطينيين، مثل الأونروا (UNRWA).

وقد فعل كل ذلك رغم أن منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية هي التي شرعنت لعملية أوسلو المترنّحة والفاشلة، والتي دشنت مسار التسوية الذي سيطرت عليه الولايات المتحدة منذ عام 1993، مما منح الكيان الصهيوني وقتًا لترسيخ قبضته على الضفة الغربية.

لكن ترامب في نهاية المطاف رئيس يتبنى شعار الصفقات التجارية التبادلية، وهو يحب أن يقدم نفسه لقاعدته "ماغا" (MAGA) التي تنادي بشعار "أميركا أولًا" كقائد قوي ذي نجاحات وإنجازات واضحة. ولذا، فإنه ليس مستعدًا لإضاعة الوقت بانتظار تحقيق وعود نتنياهو الوهمية التي يطلقها باستمرار حول إخضاع المقاومة وجعلها تستسلم. وهي وعود فشل في الوفاء بها مرارًا.

عندما انتهك نتنياهو اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار الذي وقع في 19 يناير/ كانون الثاني 2025 برعاية من فريق ترامب، وأعطى جيشه الدموي أمرًا باستئناف الهجوم الإبادي على غزة في 18 مارس/ آذار، منحه ترامب شهرين إضافيين لتحقيق أهدافه المعلنة، إلا أنه لم يستطع تحقيقها في النهاية.

وفي السابع من أبريل/ نيسان، وخلال زيارته البيتَ الأبيض، فاجأه ترامب بإعلان بدء المفاوضات النووية الأميركية الإيرانية. كان نتنياهو يعمل على إقناع الطرف الأميركي بتوجيه ضربات عسكرية مزدوجة ضد إيران، وكان يناقش تفاصيل ذلك مع مستشار الأمن القومي لترامب، مايكل والتز. بيدَ أن ترامب رفض تلك الخطط، بل وأبعد والتز عن منصبه، مقرّرًا بعد ذلك السعي لحل الموضوع النووي من خلال الدبلوماسية، مما أحبط نتنياهو وأزعجه كثيرًا.

إعلان

خلال نفس الزيارة، طلب نتنياهو دعم ترامب لسياسته في سوريا، والتي ينتهجها منذ الإطاحة بالرئيس السوري السابق بشار الأسد في ديسمبر/ كانون الأول 2024، حيث قام لأسابيع بعد سقوط الأسد بتدمير معظم القدرات العسكرية السورية المتبقية، ثم شنّ سلسلة من الغارات الجوية والاجتياحات البرية، مستوليًا على أكثر من 400 كيلومتر مربع أضافها إلى هضبة الجولان السورية المحتلة، والتي تبلغ مساحتها 1800 كيلومتر مربع.

لم يكن هدف هذه الهجمات مجرد إضعاف سوريا، بل محاولة تفكيكها إلى أربع مناطق عرقية أو طائفية: الدرزية، العلوية، الكردية، والسنية.

لكن هذا المخطط الخطير يتعارض بصورة مباشرة مع المصالح الجيوسياسية لتركيا في الحفاظ على وحدة الأراضي السورية. تركيا، وهي المستفيد الأكبر من تغيير النظام في سوريا والتي رحبت بالحكومة الجديدة واحتضنتها، كانت قد تعرضت إلى تهديدات واستفزازات من العديد من الوزراء الإسرائيليين.

أمام دهشة وذهول نتنياهو، لم يدعم ترامب فقط الرئيس التركي رجب طيب أردوغان في هذا النزاع، بل أعلن أيضًا الانسحاب الوشيك لبعض القوات الأميركية من شمال سوريا، كما دعا رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي علنًا للسعي إلى التوصل إلى تسوية مع الجانب التركي.

على مدى الأعوام الثلاثين الماضية، كانت الخلافات السياسية في العلاقة بين الولايات المتحدة والكيان الإسرائيلي نادرة للغاية. لذلك، أجبر موقف ترامب الحاسم الكيان الصهيوني على بدء تسوية تفاوضية مع تركيا في سوريا لتجنب التصعيد أو الصراع المباشر.

بالإضافة إلى ذلك، وعلى الرغم من الاعتراضات الإسرائيلية الشديدة، أعلن ترامب رفع جميع العقوبات الأميركية والدولية عن سوريا خلال زيارته الأخيرة للسعودية، وهو قرار جاء نتيجة ضغوط مكثفة من ولي العهد السعودي محمد بن سلمان، والرئيس التركي أردوغان، بدون مراعاة للتحفظات الإسرائيلية.

إعلان

كان للموضوع التجاري والاقتصادي الدور الأبرز في زيارة ترامب للمنطقة. ولقد ظهر الرئيس الأميركي متحمسًا لإظهار النجاح والإنجازات الاقتصادية أمام مؤيديه، حيث سعى إلى إنجاز صفقات أسلحة وعقود تجارية في دول الخليج الثلاث التي زارها.

بيدَ أن السعودية كانت قد رفضت تطبيع العلاقات مع الكيان الإسرائيلي في وسط عملية إبادة جماعية مستمرة بلا هوادة في غزة. وكان من ضمن مطالب السعودية لاتفاق التطبيع توفير ضمانات أمنية أميركية وبناء مفاعل نووي مدني.

كانت جهود إدارة بايدن السابقة قد استمرت لشهور من أجل تحقيق اتفاق بين الطرفين، إلا أنها باءت بالفشل بسبب رفض الطرف الإسرائيلي دعم حل سياسي مع الفلسطينيين.

غير أن ترامب فاجأ الطرف الإسرائيلي وتخلى عن شرط التطبيع وواصل زيارته للسعودية، حيث وقع أكبر صفقة أسلحة في التاريخ.

ولذلك كانت المفاجأة على الإسرائيليين كبيرة ومفجعة، وهم الذين كانوا يعارضون هذه الصفقات، ولكنهم لم يستطيعوا منعها. لو كانت هذه الصفقات مبادرة من إدارة ديمقراطية، لكان نتنياهو قد استطاع أن يحشد دعم الجمهوريين لإفشال الصفقة. ولكن لأن المبادرة جاءت من إدارة جمهورية، لم يكن بوسع نتنياهو فعل الكثير حيال ذلك.

بالإضافة إلى ذلك، فإنه بعد أسابيع قليلة من زيارة نتنياهو لواشنطن، وجّه ترامب ضربة أخرى له ولشركائه المتطرفين بإعلانه اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار مع الحوثيين في اليمن في 6 مايو/ أيار، دون أن يشترط عليهم وقف هجماتهم على الأهداف الإسرائيلية.

كان الحوثيون يستهدفون ملاحة وأجواء ومدن الكيان الصهيوني منذ شهور في محاولة منهم لوقف الإبادة في غزة. أنفقت الولايات المتحدة أكثر من مليار دولار لمحاولة وقف هذه الهجمات، دون نجاح كبير. لم يستطع ترامب تحمّل الخسائر المتراكمة، مما أدى إلى تخليه عن الكيان الصهيوني لإغلاق هذا الملف.

كانت السياسة الأميركية الدائمة في المنطقة، بغض النظر عن ماهية الحزب الحاكم في البيت الأبيض، هي منح الكيان الصهيوني حرية التصرف عند التعامل مع الفاعلين من غير الدول (Non-state actors) مثل حماس، وحزب الله، مع كبح الكيان عندما يتعلق الأمر بفاعلين من الدول مثل إيران، نظرًا للمصالح الإستراتيجية الأميركية الأوسع في المنطقة.

إعلان

ومع ذلك، فقد منح ترامب نتنياهو شهورًا من إطلاق اليد لتنفيذ حملة إبادة في غزة – بما في ذلك القيام بالقصف العشوائي الهمجي واتباع سياسة التجويع التي حرمت أكثر من مليونَي فلسطيني في غزة من وصول الغذاء والماء والدواء والوقود منذ 2 مارس/ آذار.

كان ترامب حريصًا على تأمين إطلاق سراح الأسرى الإسرائيليين، وهو حدث إذا ما تم لتباهى به ترامب كإنجاز باهر يُحسب له في السياسة الخارجية، لكن محاولاته في هذا الصدد قوبلت بتصلب مواقف نتنياهو وإصراره على تحقيق "النصر الكامل"، الذي كان من المؤكد أنه سيطيل أمد الحرب، بل ويعرض حياة الأسرى للتهديد بشكل خطير.

لذا، وقبل جولة ترامب في الخليج، قام فريقه بفتح محادثات مباشرة مع حماس – التي تصنّفها الولايات المتحدة رسميًا كمنظمة إرهابية منذ عام 1997 – من أجل تأمين إطلاق سراح عيدان ألكسندر، وهو المواطن الأميركي- الإسرائيلي الوحيد الباقي بين الأسرى.

بعد ضغط مستمر من الوسطاء، وتعهد مباشر من الطرف الأميركي بتقديم مساعدات كبيرة للفلسطينيين الجائعين في غزة، أطلقت حماس سراح ألكساندر في 12 مايو/ أيار 2025، عشية زيارة ترامب للمنطقة، حيث قُدم الإفراج عنه كبادرة حسن نية تجاه الرئيس الأميركي.

أثار هذا التحرك غضب نتنياهو وحكومته اليمينية، لأنه كشف عن استعدادهم للتضحية بالأسرى في سبيل تحقيق التطهير العرقي واحتلال غزة ضمن إقامة مشروع إسرائيل الكبرى. وبدلًا من الاحتفال بإطلاق سراح الأسير الإسرائيلي، اعتبر العديد من الإسرائيليين التعامل المباشر مع حماس خيانة لهم من ترامب.

بيدَ أنه لا ينبغي لأحد أن يتسرع في الحكم على هذا السجال السياسي. فإدارة ترامب لا تزال تضم العديد من الصهاينة الذين هم أشد المسؤولين تأييدًا للمشروع الصهيوني بين الحكومات الأميركية على الإطلاق. ولذا، فمن غير الواضح إذا كانت هذه التحولات تشير إلى تغيير طويل الأمد في السياسة الأميركية تجاه المنطقة.

إعلان

ولذلك، تبدو هذه السياسات تكتيكية أكثر من كونها إستراتيجية، حيث تبقى الأهداف النهائية للطرفين هي نفسها، لكن الوسائل قد تتغير من أجل خدمة المصالح الأميركية طويلة الأجل في المنطقة.

ربما يكون الاختبار الحقيقي النهائي للإجابة عن سؤال: مَن هو الطرف الذي يقود الطرف الآخر في هذه العلاقة؟، هو في قدرة ترامب على إجبار الكيان الإسرائيلي على وقف حرب الإبادة الجماعية في غزة. حينها سنصل إلى لحظة الحقيقة: هل ستقف الولايات المتحدة إلى جانب مصالحها الأمنية والاقتصادية في المنطقة، أم ستدعم مشروع إسرائيل الكبرى التوسعي والرؤية الدينية المسيانية؟

إن نتيجة هذا الاختبار ستحدد لنا الإجابة النهائية عن سؤال: أيهما الدمية؟ وأيهما يمسك بالخيط؟

لا يقتصر الارتباط التركي بليبيا على الأبعاد التاريخية، والثقافية، والديمغرافية المتمازجة، بل يتعدى ذلك كله إلى نواحٍ جيوستراتيجية تتعلق بمصالح البلدين معًا، وقدرتهما على تعظيم نصيبهما من ثروات المنطقة المحيطة بهما.

فليبيا تتشابه مع سوريا من حيث الأهمية الإستراتيجية بالنسبة إلى تركيا، فكما تمثّل سوريا عمقًا إستراتيجيًا مهمًا للأناضول، وتؤثّر بشكل مباشر على أمنه واستقراره، فكذلك الحال بالنسبة إلى ليبيا، التي تعدّ عمقًا إستراتيجيًا بحريًا مهمًا لتركيا، كما سيأتي شرحه بالتفصيل.

لكن ليبيا تعيش اليوم على وقع اضطرابات أمنية منذ مساء الاثنين 12 مايو/ أيار الجاري، إثر مقتل رئيس جهاز دعم الاستقرار التابع للمجلس الرئاسي عبدالغني الككلي "غنيوة"، في العاصمة طرابلس، تزامنًا مع اشتباكات قوّات تابعة لجهاز دعم الاستقرار، وأخرى من "اللواء 444 قتال" التابع لوزارة الدفاع.

ورغم أنّ رئيس الوزراء، عبد الحميد الدبيبة، شكر في صباح اليوم التالي قوات الجيش والشرطة على "ما حققوه من إنجاز كبير في بسط الأمن وفرض سلطة الدولة في العاصمة"، فإن الاشتباكات سرعان ما تجددت مرة أخرى، قبل أن تعلن وزارة الدفاع بحكومة الوحدة في طرابلس وقفًا لإطلاق النار، ونشر قوات نظامية محايدة في نقاط التماس.

إعلان

هذه الهشاشة الأمنية دفعت بعثة الأمم المتحدة لدى ليبيا، إلى تشكيل "لجنة للهدنة"، بالتعاون مع المجلس الرئاسي الليبي، وذلك لرعاية وقف إطلاق النار الذي تمّ التوصل إليه.

الاضطراب لم يقتصر على الأوضاع الأمنية، بل امتدّ إلى الفضاء السياسي، حيث حاول البرلمان الموجود في الشرق، والذي يترأسه عقيلة صالح، التمدد صوب الغرب، حيث توجد حكومة الدبيبة المعترف بها دوليًا، حيث أعلن عن فرز ملفات مرشحين لتولي رئاسة الحكومة، وذلك بالتعاون مع المجلس الأعلى للدولة الذي يوجد في طرابلس، ويترأسه خالد المشري.

كما شهدت العاصمة الليبية، مظاهرات شعبية طالبت برحيل الدبيبة، فيما أشارت تقارير صحفية إلى استقالة وزراء ونواب وزراء.

هذا الاضطراب فتح الباب على مصراعيه على جميع السيناريوهات، التي يمكن أن تعصف ببلد يعاني أصلًا من الانقسام الجهوي، وتتنازعه حكومتان، إحداهما في الغرب بقيادة الدبيبة وتحظى باعتراف دولي، والثانية في الشرق برئاسة أسامة حماد، وتحظى بدعم القوات المسلحة التي يتزعمها، خليفة حفتر وأبناؤه.

ونظرًا للانخراط التركي في الأزمة منذ سنوات عبر اتفاقيات، ووجود عسكري وازن، كان التساؤل عما يمكن أن تقدمه أنقرة لاحتواء الأزمة، والبدائل التي بحوزتها للحيلولة دون دخول البلاد في فوضى، تعصف بأمنها واستقرارها، وتؤثر على المصالح الإستراتيجية التركية هناك.

الأهمية الإستراتيجية لليبيا

لعبت المذكرة التي وقّعتها تركيا مع حكومة رئيس الوزراء السابق، فايز السراج، والمعروفة باسم "مذكرة التفاهم بشأن ترسيم صلاحيات المساحات البحرية" دورًا محوريًا في إعادة تموضع تركيا في البحر المتوسط، بعد عقود من العزلة الإجبارية، ومحاولة حرمانها من ثروات شرق البحر المتوسط.

ففي عام 2004، نشر الأستاذان في جامعة إشبيلية الإسبانية، خوان لويس سواريز دي فيفيرو، وخوان كارلوس رودريغز ماتيوس، دراسة تحت عنوان: "أوروبا البحرية وتوسيع عضوية الاتحاد: آفاق جيوسياسية"، حوت خريطة للوضع البحري لدول كانت تريد الانضمام آنذاك للاتحاد، مثل؛ رومانيا، وبلغاريا، وكرواتيا، وتركيا.

إعلان

حوَت تلك الدراسة خريطة عرفت لاحقًا باسم "خريطة إشبيلية" منحت تركيا منطقة بحرية ضيقة محصورة في سواحل أنطاليا، رغم أنها صاحبة أطول ساحلٍ شرقَ المتوسط، في وقت منحت فيه لكل جزيرة يونانية منطقة اقتصادية خالصة بطول 370 كيلومترًا، ومنها جزيرة كاستيلوريزو (ميس) التي تبعد عن السواحل التركية بكيلومترين فقط، فيما يفصلها عن السواحل اليونانية نحو 580 كيلومترًا!

هنا جاءت اتفاقية ترسيم الحدود البحرية مع ليبيا، لتمنح أنقرة صكًا قويًا في المطالبة بحقوقها، خاصة في ثروات شرق المتوسط، بعد حصولها على منطقة اقتصادية خالصة تقدر بآلاف الكيلومترات وفق الاتفاق.

ففي دراسة نشرتها دائرة الاتصالات برئاسة الجمهورية التركية عام 2020، بعنوان: "خطوة إستراتيجية في معادلة شرقي المتوسط"، اعتبرت أن الاتفاقية، تعد الأولى من نوعها التي توقّعها تركيا مع دولة مطلة على البحر المتوسط غير قبرص التركية، فيما يخصّ مواضيع الجرف القاري/ المناطق الاقتصادية الخالصة.

كما أضافت الدراسة أن الاتفاقية حافظت على حقوق كلٍّ من تركيا، وليبيا في البحر المتوسط، ومكّنت أنقرة من إرسال رسالة بأنها "لن تسمح بالأمر الواقع في المنطقة".

لكل هذا لم يكن من المنتظر أن تكتفي أنقرة بالمراقبة والمتابعة، خاصة مع احتفاظها بقوات لها في المنطقة الغربية، وفقًا لمذكرة التعاون الأمني والعسكري الموقعة عام 2019.

البدائل التركية لحل الأزمة

رغم أن تركيا تعد حليفًا رسميًا للحكومة الليبية في الغرب، ودعمتها عسكريًا في صد عدوان حفتر والدول الداعمة له على العاصمة طرابلس، في يونيو/ حزيران 2020، بعد أكثر من سنة من بدء الهجوم حينها، فإن أنقرة عملت في السنوات اللاحقة على التواصل مع القائد العسكري، خليفة حفتر في الشرق، ما قاد إلى زيارة نجله، صدام حفتر، العاصمة التركية أنقرة في أبريل/ نيسان الماضي، حيث استقبله وزير الدفاع التركي، يشار غولار، وقائد القوات البرية، سلجوق بيرقدارأوغلو.

إعلان

فيما وقّع نجله الثاني، بلقاسم خليفة حفتر، مدير صندوق التنمية وإعادة إعمار ليبيا، عقودًا مع شركات تركية لتنفيذ مشاريع تخصّ البنية التحتية والإنشاءات.

إضافة إلى ذلك، تطوُّر العلاقات التركية المصرية، بعد أن وصلت إلى حد المواجهة العسكرية في ليبيا عام 2020.

لكل ما سبق فإنه من الطبيعي أن تختلف الإستراتيجية التركية المتبعة عما كانت عليه قبل نحو خمس سنوات، حيث تتّجه سياسة أنقرة إلى اتباع سياسة "إدارة الخلافات" مع الدول الصديقة، بما لا يسمح بتدهور العلاقات البينية، ويحافظ على المصالح المشتركة.

ففي حوار صحفي لوزير الخارجية التركي، هاكان فيدان، نشرته مجلة "جون أفريك" منتصف مايو/ أيار الجاري، أفصح فيدان عن إستراتيجية بلاده لمواجهة أزمة الانقسام، وكيفية إعادة اللحمة بين مكونات الشعب الليبي، على النحو التالي:

أولًا: الاتفاق على تشكيل حكومة مرضية لكلا الجانبين، تمهّد لاستحقاق الانتخابات، معربًا عن رفضه إجراء الانتخابات دون "نضج عملية سياسية".

واعتبر فيدان أن إجراء الانتخابات في ظل الأجواء الحالية قد يكون "محل تنافس بين المعسكرين الشرقي والغربي"، أي أنها ستتحول إلى تنافسية جهوية وليست بين مكونات شعب واحد، مؤكدًا أن أنقرة تعمل على التمكين لذلك الخيار.

ثانيًا: اعتماد أسلوب الحوار مع القوى المؤثرة في المشهد الليبي للحيلولة دون تجدد المواجهات العسكرية مرة أخرى، حيث قال فيدان: "نتحدث بانتظام مع روسيا وشركائنا الليبيين في الشرق. كانت أولويتنا على مدى السنوات الخمس الماضية تجنب المواجهة العسكرية بين الشرق والغرب".

والملاحظة المهمة هنا وصْفه القوى السياسية والعسكرية الموجودة في الشرق الليبي بـ "الشركاء"، ما يعني أن تركيا نجحت في تجسير العلاقة بعد سنوات قليلة من توقف المواجهات العسكرية، بل وأعادت تعريف القوى الفاعلة في الشرق.

إعلان

ما يعني أن تموضعها الحالي بين الغرب والشرق، يتيح لها القيام بدور فعال في الوساطة بين الجانبين لإنهاء الانقسام وتوحيد الجيش والأجهزة الأمنية، وهذا تقدم مهم يحسب للدبلوماسية التركية.

ثالثًا: التحذير من المزيد من العسكرة، وإشارة فيدان هنا إلى القوات الروسية، التي لوحظ نقلها جزءًا من آلياتها وعتادها العسكري من سوريا إلى ليبيا، عقب سقوط نظام الأسد في ديسمبر/ كانون الأول الماضي.

فالإستراتيجية التركية بشكل عام تعمل على إفراغ المنطقة من القوات الأجنبية، حيث تبذل جهودًا كبيرة لإقناع واشنطن بسحب قواتها من سوريا، وهُرعت إلى تشكيل آلية أمنية مشتركة مع الأردن وسوريا، لسد فراغ القوات الأميركية عقب رحيلها، لمواجهة تنظيم الدولة ومنع تمدده مجددًا.

التعاون الإقليمي

على ذات النسق السوري، قد تعمل تركيا في الملف الليبي، على تخفيف أو إنهاء الوجود العسكري الروسي، وإعادة توحيد البلاد عبر آلية إقليمية تراعي المصالح الإستراتيجية لدول الجوار الليبي.

وفي تقديري، فإن تركيا تحتاج هنا إلى التنسيق مع مصر، من خلال تأسيس حوار إستراتيجي معمق بشأن إنهاء الأزمة الليبية.

فالعلاقات بين أنقرة والقاهرة تشهد نموًا مطردًا، بحيث تجاوزت النطاق الاقتصادي، إلى نطاقات أخرى إستراتيجية وعسكرية، حيث زار رئيس أركان الجيش المصري، أحمد فتحي خليفة، تركيا، والتقى نظيره، متين غوراك، الشهر الجاري، وعقد الطرفان الاجتماع الأول للحوار العسكري رفيع المستوى بين البلدين، والمخطط تنظيمه سنويًا على مستوى رئاسة أركان الدولتين.

مثل هذه الاجتماعات يمكن تكرارها على مستوى وزارتَي الخارجية، وجهازَي الاستخبارات في البلدين، للوصول إلى رؤى مشتركة لحل أزمات المنطقة الملتهبة في ليبيا، وغزة، والسودان، وغيرها.

الخلاصة

إن الهدوء الذي تعيشه ليبيا هذه الأيام، هو هدوء هشّ، قد ينهار في أي لحظة سواء في طرابلس، أو بين الشرق والغرب، ومن الأهمية بمكان أن تتخذ تركيا -ذات التموضع المتميز داخل ليبيا- خطوات استباقية لنزع فتيل الأزمة، واتّخاذ خطوات جادّة، مع الشركاء المحليين ودول الجوار، لإعادة الوحدة للدولة الممزقة، ودمج المؤسّسات المنقسمة، والحيلولة دون تجدّد القتال.

غزة- لا شيء في خيمة السيدة ممتازة صُبح يوحي بالحياة سوى صراخ أبنائها الثلاثة المتواصل طلبا للطعام، وهم الذين يعانون من الإعاقة الذهنية. بينما يلاصق خيمتها مكب نفايات يقع في قلب مدينة غزة، في ظروف لا تصلح لحياة البشر.

لا يدرك أبناؤها أن قطاع غزة بأكمله يعيش مجاعة خانقة، منذ أن أغلقت إسرائيل المعابر قبل قرابة 80 يوما، ولا يفهمون معنى الحصار ولا يتقبلون الأعذار، ويطلبون الطعام دون توقف من والدتهم التي تصارع وحدها لإسكات صرخاتهم.

وبينما تعاني غزة من مجاعة جراء حصار مشدد تفرضه إسرائيل منذ بداية مارس/آذار الماضي، ويعيش معظم السكان في خيام بعد تدمير منازلهم، وسط إغلاق المعابر ومنع دخول الغذاء والدواء والوقود وانعدام المساعدات وصعوبة الوصول إلى الطعام، تواجه الفئات الأضعف، كذوي الإعاقة الذهنية، أوضاعا إنسانية مأساوية.

الجوع ينهش الصمت

نزحت السيدة ممتازة من بيت لاهيا شمالا إلى مدينة غزة قبل نحو شهرين، وهدم جيش الاحتلال منزلها هناك، وتعيش في الخيمة التي منحتها لها إحدى الجهات الخيرية. ومنذ نزوحها، لا يوجد عند ممتازة أي مصدر دخل، وتعيش على الصدقات، وتحصل على الطعام من التكيات ومن يتبرع لها من "أهل الخير".

ومع تفاقم المجاعة جراء نقص الغذاء وقلة التكيات، تفاقمت الأوضاع المأساوية لعائلة صُبح، خاصة أن أبناءها من ذوي الإعاقة الذهنية، غير قادرين على تحمّل الجوع، أو تفهم أسبابه. وتقول ممتازة للجزيرة نت، "كان عندي بيت في منطقة بيت لاهيا، صحيح بسيط، لكنه كان ساترَنا وحافظ كرامتنا، لكن الآن نحن في الشارع".

ولا تتوقف معاناة ممتازة عند فقدان المأوى، بل تمتد لتدخل عمق حياتها اليومية، فأبناؤها الثلاثة: صقر (25 عاما)، وصخر (23 عاما)، وأحمد (22 عاما) تمنعهم إعاقتهم من فهم معنى "حرب" أو "حصار" أو "مجاعة".

لم تأكل العائلة خبزا منذ شهر، فلا يوجد دقيق في المنزل، وحينما يحضر الطعام، فإنه لا يتعدى العدس الأحمر الذي يصلها كهِبات من بعض الأقارب أو المحسنين، وتوضح أن أولادها لا يحبون العدس، لكنهم يضطرون لأكله لعدم توفر البديل.

تعيش ممتازة هذه الحياة كل يوم، دون انقطاع ودون استراحة، رغم أنها أم مريضة بالسكري وضغط الدم المرتفع، لا تقوى على مجاراة الجوع المتكرر لأبنائها، ولا على حمل المياه من المسافات البعيدة، ولا على الجري خلفهم عندما يصرخون أو يعتدون على بعضهم بعضا.

تقول "أنا مش قادرة، بمشي وبنهار، وعندما أفقد السيطرة، أذهب للنوم وأتركهم يصرخون، يكسرون أي شي حواليهم، أذهب للنوم ليس لأجل النوم، ولكنني لأستسلم أمام كل هذا التعب".

ولا تنتهي المأساة في هذه الخيمة عند الجوع، فوجودها إلى جوار مكب نفايات يجعلها ساحة للحشرات التي تغزوهم ليل نهار، تسبح على وجوههم، وتلدغهم، وتوقظهم من نومهم، وفي هذا تقول ممتازة "طول الليل أطارد الحشرات، كل ما أقتل وحدة بلاقي عشرة غيرها، أما الرائحة فهي خانقة".

ارتفاع نسبة الإعاقة

يكشف الدكتور إياد الكرُنز، منسق قطاع الإعاقة في شبكة المنظمات الأهلية بقطاع غزة، أن العدوان على غزة تسبب في ارتفاع غير مسبوق في أعداد ذوي الإعاقة، حيث أُضيف نحو 32 ألف شخص إلى القائمة، بزيادة تقدَّر بـ 52% مقارنة بالأعداد المسجّلة قبل الحرب، والتي بلغت آنذاك 58 ألف حالة، وفق بيانات الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء الفلسطيني.

وأضاف الكرُنز للجزيرة نت، "هذه الأرقام لا تزال غير نهائية، إذ يُسجَّل يوميا من 10 إلى 12 حالة جديدة، غالبيتها من الأطفال مبتوري الأطراف".

وأوضح الكرُنز أن الأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة – سواء الجدد أو القدامى- يواجهون ظروفا بالغة القسوة، إذ يعانون من نقص حاد في الغذاء والمكملات الغذائية والفيتامينات والبروتينات.

ولفت إلى أن حالة المجاعة السائدة في قطاع غزة حاليا، تفاقم من حالة المعاقين الذين يحتاجون إلى تغذية سليمة، مشيرا إلى أن فئة المعاقين "ذهنيا" يطلبون الطعام باستمرار لأن أدمغتهم لا تضبط مسألة الإحساس بالشبع، مما يُشكل عبئا نفسيا وماديا متزايدا على أهاليهم.

كما ذكر أن المعاقين يفتقدون "الأدوية والحفاظات والأجهزة المساعدة مثل الكراسي المتحركة والأطراف الصناعية". وأشار الكرُنز إلى أن البُنى التحتية في مراكز الإيواء، تفتقر لأبسط متطلبات ذوي الإعاقة. وأشار إلى أن هذه الفئة تخوض "منافسة غير عادلة مع الأصحاء للحصول على الماء والغذاء والعلاج".

وتفاقمت معاناة ذوي الإعاقة، بحسب الكرُنز، بفعل تدمير إسرئيل مراكز التأهيل التي كانوا يعتمدون عليها، إضافة إلى فقدانهم أدواتهم المساعدة نظرا للنزوح المستمر والمتكرر.

وبيّن أن تدمير المستشفيات والنقص الحاد في الرعاية الصحية يسهم في تدهور أوضاع ذوي الإعاقة، ويقصّر من أعمار كثيرين منهم. كما سلط الضوء على معاناة فئة ذوي الإعاقات الذهنية، وخاصة المصابين بالشلل الدماغي، مشيرا إلى أن معاناتهم "مركّبة"، إذ يعانون من إعاقات حركية مصاحبة، ويحتاجون إلى تغذية وأدوات طبية خاصة وكراسي متحركة لا تتوفر حاليا.

قالت هيئة البث الإسرائيلية اليوم السبت إن الجيش أدخل كل ألوية المشاة والمدرعات النظامية إلى قطاع غزة، ضمن حربه المستمرة على القطاع. يأتي ذلك بعد ساعات من كشف الإذاعة الرسمية الإسرائيلية عن استعداد الجيش لتعزيز قواته في القطاع من خلال خطة تقضي بإدخال 5 فرق عسكرية للسيطرة الكاملة على القطاع.

وبعد ساعات من قرار إدخال كل ألوية المشاة، أكدت وسائل إعلام إسرائيلية إصابة جنود في معارك بقطاع غزة، وأن مروحيات نقلتهم نحو مستشفيات خارج القطاع.

وقالت هيئة البث الإسرائيلية إن فرقة المظليين كانت آخر من دخل القطاع، وقد أكملت دخولها خلال الـ24 ساعة الماضية، مشيرة إلى أن العمليات تتركز في هذه المرحلة على محورين رئيسيين هما شمال القطاع ومنطقة خان يونس.

وذكرت هيئة البث نقلا عن مصادر عسكرية إسرائيلية قولها إنه يتم تحريك القوات في عمق القطاع ببطء، خلافا للمرات السابقة، مما يعني أن تقدم القوات الإسرائيلية سيتم بغطاء جوي لتقليل الخطر عليها.

ومن حين لآخر، يعلن الجيش الإسرائيلي توسيع عملياته في محاور التوغل بقطاع غزة، لا سيما مع قرار الحكومة والجيش مطلع الشهر الجاري توسيع تلك العمليات في غزة، في ظل استدعاء عشرات آلاف من جنود الاحتياط.

إعلان

وفي العام الأول من عدوانه على غزة عقب عملية "طوفان الأقصى"، سحب جيش الاحتلال أكثر من 15 لواء عسكريا من القطاع بعد اشتباكات ضارية وخسائر بشرية ومادية كبيرة.

شملت هذه الانسحابات تشكيلات عسكرية بارزة مثل لواء غولاني واللواء السابع ولواء 188 (باراك) ولواء المظليين (اللواء 35) ولواء غفعاتي.

وجاءت قرارات الانسحاب في إطار إعادة تقييم الإستراتيجية العسكرية وتقليل الخسائر التي تكبدتها قوات الاحتلال بسبب المقاومة الفلسطينية في قطاع غزة.

ويأتي هذا في حين تواصل إسرائيل منذ 7 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2023 جرائم إبادة جماعية في غزة خلّفت أكثر من 175 ألف فلسطيني بين شهيد وجريح -معظمهم أطفال ونساء- وما يزيد على 11 ألف مفقود، إلى جانب مئات آلاف النازحين.

تحقق الشرطة الفرنسية في احتمال أن يكون حريق متعمد هو السبب الرئيس لانقطاع التيار الكهربائي في منطقة الألب البحرية بجنوب البلاد، بما في ذلك مدينة "كان" التي تستضيف حفل اختتام مهرجانها السينمائي العالمي السنوي الشهير اليوم السبت.

وقال متحدث باسم الدرك الوطني الفرنسي "نبحث في احتمال إشعال حريق عمدا"، مضيفا أن الشرطة لم تعتقل أحدا حتى الآن.

وذكرت السلطات المحلية لمنطقة الألب البحرية في وقت سابق اليوم أن الجزء الغربي من المنطقة، الذي يضم مدينة كان، يعاني من انقطاع كبير في التيار الكهربائي وأن شبكة النقل والكهرباء تعمل على إعادة التيار.

وأوضح مهرجان كان السينمائي أن حفل الختام يقام في موعده مساء السبت، وقال في بيان إن القصر الذي يحتضن الحفل الختامي استفاد من مصدر طاقة مستقل "ما يسمح بإقامة جميع الفعاليات والعروض المقررة -بما في ذلك حفل الختام- كما هو مخطط لها وفي ظروف طبيعية".

عمل تخريبي

وذكرت صحيفة "لوباريزيان" أن التيار عاد إلى 160 ألف منزل متضرر بعد الظهر، وذلك بعد حوالي 6 ساعات من الانقطاع.

وأضافت أن أعمال تخريب مسّت أحد أعمدة خط التوتر العالي الذي يزود مدينة كان بالطاقة في بلدية فيلنوف-لوبِيه، وفق ما أعلنه المدعي العام في مدينة غراس ومحافظ الألب-البحرية.

ونقلت لوباريزيان عن شبكة النقل والكهرباء قولها إنها سجلت حادثتين منفصلتين، الأولى كانت حريقا وقع في محطة توتر عال في تانيرون (إقليم فار) فجر السبت، وقد تمت السيطرة عليه.

لكن هذا الحريق أضعف الشبكة الكهربائية المحلية، مما تسبب في سقوط أحد الأعمدة الكهربائية حوالي الساعة العاشرة صباحا على خط توتر عال، وهذا الحادث هو الذي تسبب مباشرة في الانقطاع.

إعلان

وتابعت أنه وفقا للمعلومات الأولية من التحقيق، فسبب ما جرى "عمل تخريبي متعمد"، حسبما صرح به داميان سافارزيكس، المدعي العام في غراس حيث استهدِف عمود واحد فقط.

وشجبت محافظة الألب-البحرية "الأعمال التخريبية الخطيرة التي تمس بسلامة البنية التحتية الكهربائية".

حريق آخر

أما بخصوص الحريق الثاني الذي اندلع في محطة التوتر العالي في تانيرون (فار)، فقد أكدت الدرك الوطني الفرنسي للصحيفة أنه يرجح أن يكون عملا إجراميًا ونتيجة حريق متعمد. وأُوكل التحقيق إلى فرقة أبحاث الدرك، وقد فتح مكتب النيابة تحقيقا في القضية.

وأوضحت الصحيفة أن الانقطاع أثر على برنامج كان السينمائي، حيث وقع أثناء عرض فيلم. وأفادت إدارة المهرجان أن العروض استؤنفت في قصر المهرجانات بفضل مولد كهربائي مستقل، مؤكدة أن حفل اختتام المهرجان لن يتأثر.

وفي كان أيضا، ذكرت قناة تلفزيونية محلية أن الشرطة البلدية تدير حركة المرور لأن إشارات المرور توقفت عن العمل. كما لوحظ اضطراب كبير في الشبكة الهاتفية، بحسب صحيفة لوباريزيان.

وعانت من تداعيات المشكلة مجموعة بلديات، وقال رجال الإطفاء في الألب-البحرية للصحيفة إنهم قاموا "بحوالي 100 تدخل لتحرير أشخاص عالقين في المصاعد منذ صباح السبت"، وظلوا طيلة اليوم يقومون بتدخلات حسب درجة الاستعجال. كما تعطلت حركة القطارات بسبب انقطاع في نظام الإشارات في كان.

وقال عمدة كان، دافيد ليسنار، في اتصال مع لوباريزيان إن الانقطاع تسبب في مشاكل هائلة في الحياة اليومية للسكان والتجار، خاصة مئات المطاعم، وحركة النقل.

اعتبر موقع أكسيوس إعلان الرئيس الأميركي دونالد ترامب ووزير خارجيته ماركو روبيو تنفيذ عملية هيكلة جذرية لـ مجلس الأمن القومي الأميركي خطوة مفاجئة تعكس تحولا عميقا في هيكل صناعة القرار الأمني الأميركي.

وأشار الموقع الأميركي إلى أن عملية الهيكلة تشمل تقليص عدد موظفيه إلى النصف تقريبا، ونقل كثير من صلاحياته إلى وزارتي الخارجية والدفاع.

ونقل عن مسؤولين في البيت الأبيض قولهم إن هذه الخطوة ستحقق تقليصا للبيروقراطية "المعرقِلة"، وتصفية ما يعتبرونه "الدولة العميقة" التي تضم مسؤولين من أصحاب المناصب الدائمة، الذين لا يشاركون الرئيس رؤيته.

وقال أحد هؤلاء المسؤولين لموقع أكسيوس: "مجلس الأمن القومي هو المعقل الرئيسي للدولة العميقة. إنها معركة ماركو ضد الدولة العميقة، ونحن نقوم بتفكيكها".

ويأتي هذا التغيير في إطار رؤية إدارة ترامب التي ترى أن الهيكل التنظيمي التقليدي للمجلس –المكوَّن من لجان متعددة- بات معرقلا لاتخاذ القرار، ويجب استبداله بنهج أكثر مباشرة يستجيب بسرعة لتوجيهات الرئيس.

روبيو: إعادة الأمور إلى أصلها

وقال وزير الخارجية ماركو روبيو، الذي يشغل أيضا منصب مستشار الأمن القومي بالوكالة، في بيان إن إعادة ضبط حجم مجلس الأمن القومي تتماشى مع هدفه الأصلي ورؤية الرئيس. و"سيكون المجلس في وضع أفضل للتعاون مع الوكالات المختلفة".

إعلان

وأشار مسؤولون إلى أن الموظفين الذين سيتم الاستغناء عنهم لن يُفصلوا، بل سيتم نقلهم إلى وظائف حكومية أخرى. وفي المقابل، سيتركز دور مجلس الأمن القومي على "التنسيق وتقديم المشورة، لا على تنفيذ السياسة"، بحسب مصادر مطلعة.

توافق داخل الفريق الرئاسي

ويرى مسؤولون في الإدارة أن تقليص الهيكل البيروقراطي للمجلس لن يكون له آثار سلبية، إذ يسيطر الانسجام والتفاهم على الفريق الحالي. وقال أحدهم: "لدينا فريق متجانس من أمثال روبيو، ووزير الدفاع بيت هيغسيث، ووزير الخزانة سكوت بيسينت، والنائب العام بام بوندي، وكلهم يعرفون ما يريد الرئيس وينفذونه دون صراع صلاحيات".

وضرب المسؤول مثالا على ذلك بقرار ترامب الأخير بإلغاء العقوبات على سوريا، حيث تم تنفيذ القرار فورا بتوجيه مباشر من الرئيس إلى الوزراء المعنيين، دون المرور بسلسلة اللجان والهيئات التقليدية داخل المجلس.

ووفقا لمصادر داخل الإدارة، فإن ترامب يرغب في بقاء روبيو في موقعه كمستشار للأمن القومي لأطول فترة ممكنة، وهو "الشخص الذي يتخذ القرارات فعليا"، بحسب أحد المطلعين.

الصراع مع الدولة العميقة

يُذكر أن روبيو، الذي أشرف في وقت سابق على تقليص وكالة التنمية الدولية ويسعى لتبسيط وزارة الخارجية، عبّر مرارا عن قلقه من تأثير الموظفين الدائمين في مؤسسات الدولة.

وسبق أن قال لترامب خلال صياغة السياسة الأميركية تجاه كوبا عام 2017: "ما التزمت به بشأن كوبا لن يأتي من الكادر المهني. عليك أن تُملي ما يجب عليهم فعله".

وختم الموقع تقريره قائلا إن هذه التغييرات تشير إلى نية واضحة لدى إدارة ترامب بإحكام قبضتها على عملية صنع القرار الأمني والسياسي، وتجاوز المؤسسات البيروقراطية التقليدية التي يُنظر إليها باعتبارها عائقا أمام تنفيذ أجندة الرئيس.

كشف تحقيق لصحيفة "واشنطن بوست" الأميركية أن مشروع آلية المساعدات الإنسانية إلى قطاع غزة، المدعوم من الولايات المتحدة، عن طريق منظمة تُدعى "مؤسسة غزة الإنسانية"، يواجه عقبات كبيرة وشكوكا في جدواه.

وقالت الصحيفة إن المنظمات الإنسانية والجهات المانحة المحتملة وكبار الضباط الإسرائيليين شككوا في جدوى مشروع آلية المساعدات الإنسانية الجديد، وما إذا كان الهدف منه إعادة احتلال غزة.

بل إن بعض الأشخاص الذين شاركوا في التخطيط المبكر للمؤسسة بدؤوا في النأي بأنفسهم عن المشروع، مشيرين إلى مخاوف أخلاقية بشأن احتمال أن تسهّل الخطة التهجير القسري للفلسطينيين، أو تسهم في إساءة استخدام البيانات البيومترية، وحتى مقارنتها بشركة "بلاك ووتر"، وهي شركة مرتزقة أميركية تورطت في أعمال عنف ضد المدنيين في العراق.

ونقلت واشنطن بوست عن مصادر أن خطة المساعدات الجديدة لغزة في حالة ارتباك وشك، ولم ينضم إليها بعد مسؤولو إغاثة بارزون.

وحسب الصحيفة، فإن الدول العربية والأوروبية التي طرحت كممول مفترض للمشروع تراجعت عن ذلك، مما أثار تساؤلات بشأن كيفية حصول آلية المساعدات الجديدة على التمويل وإمدادات المساعدات.

تساؤلات محرجة

وفي وثائق داخلية لم يُكشف عنها سابقا، تقترح خطة الجهات الداعمة للمشروع بالتشاور مع إسرائيل، التي تحمل رسميا اسم “مؤسسة غزة الإنسانية”، وهي منظمة جديدة مسجّلة في جنيف، إحداث تغيير شامل في آلية إيصال المساعدات، من خلال إنشاء مراكز إنسانية في جنوب غزة، تتولى إدارتها وتأمينها شركات خاصة، وعناصر أمنية ذات خلفيات عسكرية، يُرجَّح أن تكون من الولايات المتحدة.

إعلان

وبذلك، تتجاوز هذه الخطة عمليا النظام الراسخ لتقديم المساعدات، الذي أنشأته وكالة غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين (الأونروا)، وحافظت عليه على مدار عقود. وفي نهاية المطاف، ووفقا للخطة، سيعيش الفلسطينيون في مجمعات سكنية محمية، قد يستوعب كل منها عشرات الآلاف من المدنيين.

لكن الوثائق أظهرت أنه منذ نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني 2024، توقعت الجهة المُخططة أن تواجه المؤسسة تساؤلات حرجة وقد تضر بسمعتها من الرأي العام حول أصولها الغامضة، ومؤهلاتها، ومشروعيتها الأخلاقية.

ومن المقرر إطلاق عملية تقديم المساعدات التابعة لمؤسسة الإنسانية يوم الاثنين. وبحسب المقترح، ستبدأ مؤسسة غزة الإنسانية، في المرحلة الأولية، بإنشاء 4 مواقع توزيع آمنة وقابلة للتوسيع، بحيث يُتيح كل موقع إمكانية الوصول إلى الغذاء، والمياه، والإمدادات الضرورية الأخرى، لنحو 300 ألف شخص. وبعد هذه المرحلة الأولية، يمكن توسيع نطاق العملية للوصول إلى مليوني شخص في غزة.

ولا يقدّم المقترح تفاصيل واضحة حول كيفية عمل المؤسسة ميدانيا، أو مصدر تمويل عملياتها الشاملة، وما لذلك من تبعات كبيرة على مليوني فلسطيني محاصرين داخل القطاع الذي تبلغ مساحته 140 ميلا مربعا ويواجهون خطر المجاعة، بحسب تقديرات الأمم المتحدة.

ومنذ الثاني من مارس/آذار الماضي، لم تدخل أي مساعدات إنسانية إلى غزة، وصوّت المجلس الأمني المصغر بقيادة رئيس الوزراء بنيامين نتنياهو في الرابع من مايو/أيار على السماح باستئناف توزيع المساعدات فقط وفق نموذج يشبه مؤسسة غزة الإنسانية.

وتكافح هذه المؤسسة لاستقطاب منظمات إنسانية راسخة أو جهات مانحة رئيسية، إذ تقول الأمم المتحدة والعديد من المنظمات الإنسانية إنها لا تستطيع التعاون مع نموذج ينتهك مبادئها التي تحظر التحقق من هويات المستفيدين من المساعدات، وقد لا يكون كافيا لتغذية جميع سكان غزة.

إعلان

وردا على أسئلة صحيفة "واشنطن بوست"، قال متحدث باسم "مؤسسة غزة الإنسانية" إنهم حصلوا بالفعل على تمويل قدره 100 مليون دولار من جهة مانحة لم يُكشف عنها، وإنه كان "إنجازا كبيرا" أن تنتقل المؤسسة من فكرة إلى موافقة ثم إلى تقديم الطعام للجوعى.

وأضاف المتحدث أن المؤسسة لا تعتبر بناء المجمعات السكنية أو التحقق من هوية المستفيدين جزءا من خططها الحالية، مشددا على أن المؤسسة لن تشارك أبدا أو تدعم أي شكل من أشكال التهجير القسري للمدنيين.

وأشار متحدث باسم مؤسسة غزة الإنسانية إلى أن المؤسسة تضغط حاليا على إسرائيل للسماح بإنشاء مراكز إضافية وتمكينها من خدمة المدنيين في جميع أنحاء غزة. وأضاف: "لا يوجد حد لعدد المواقع التي يمكن للمؤسسة إنشاؤها، ولا أماكنها". وأوضح: "نتوقع افتتاح 4 مواقع بحلول نهاية الشهر، ونخطط فعليا لمواقع إضافية في أنحاء غزة".

وقد بدأ المتعهدون العاملون مع المؤسسة في بناء تلك المراكز، ووصلت عناصرها المسلحة بالفعل إلى إسرائيل. ومع ذلك، لا يزال من غير الواضح من سيوفر المساعدات ويوزعها فعليا.

تحضيرات طويلة الأمد

في منتصف 2024، شارك مسؤولون إسرائيليون خططهم مع مجموعة من المستشارين الأميركيين في القطاع الخاص بقيادة فيل رايلي، وهو ضابط سابق في العمليات شبه العسكرية في وكالة الاستخبارات المركزية (سي آي إيه).

وبحسب 5 من المطلعين الإسرائيليين والأميركيين، تولّت مجموعة رايلي مهمة التخطيط، وتم اختيار شركته الجديدة "حلول الوصول الآمن" لتكون المقاول الفرعي الأمني واللوجيستي للمراكز. وكان تانكمان، المقيم في تل أبيب، يعمل كحلقة وصل بين الفريق الأميركي والمسؤولين الإسرائيليين. وبحلول نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني 2024، بدأت ملامح "مؤسسة غزة الإنسانية" تتشكل.

ولم تتطرق إحدى الوثائق التي اطلعت عليها صحيفة واشنطن بوست -وهي ملخص تنفيذي أعدّ لمعهد أبحاث إسرائيلي- إلى تفاصيل المساعدات التي سيتم توزيعها، والتي كانت من المفترض أن تتكفل بها المنظمات غير الحكومية المشاركة، بل ركزت الخطة على عدد عناصر الأمن، والأسلحة، والمركبات المدرعة المطلوبة، وتصميم أنظمة الاتصال، والمخططات الأساسية لـ4 مراكز توزيع يمكن للمدنيين القدوم إليها لتسلّم المساعدات.

إعلان

كما نصّت الخطة على إنشاء مركز عمليات بعيد يراقب النشاطات في غزة على مدار الساعة باستخدام الكاميرات والطائرات بدون طيار، وفي مرحلتها الأخيرة، تطوير مناطق سكنية محمية أُطلق عليها اسم "مناطق الانتقال الإنساني"، يعيش فيها سكان غزة.

وأشار المخططون إلى أهمية طمأنة السكان بأنهم سيتمكنون من العودة إلى منازلهم حين يصبح الوضع آمنا، كما أعدّوا قوائم بمؤثرين على "إنستغرام" و"إكس" من العالم العربي يجب على المؤسسة التواصل معهم كجزء من حملة إعلامية لبناء دعم شعبي للمشروع.

ولكسب الدعم الدبلوماسي، اقترحت الخطة أن تسعى المؤسسة لإقناع دول غربية مثل ألمانيا و"إقناع فرنسا" -التي تُعتبر أكثر انتقادا لإسرائيل- "بعدم التدخل السياسي في غزة وعمليات المؤسسة لمدة عام".

إدارة ترامب في الواجهة

وسعى المخططون أيضا إلى التقليل من ارتباطهم بالحكومة الإسرائيلية. فعلى الرغم من أنهم تمتعوا بـ"شراكة قوية" مع المسؤولين الإسرائيليين وحصلوا على مدخلات من الجيش والمخابرات الإسرائيلية، فإن الوثيقة أشارت إلى أن مؤسسة غزة الإنسانية يجب أن تتجنب الظهور بمظهر "تابع أو وكيل للحكومة الإسرائيلية"، لكنها في الوقت نفسه يجب أن تكون مستعدة للإجابة عن أسئلة حول كيف حصلت "منظمة غير حكومية لم يُسمع بها من قبل على موافقات فريدة من نوعها من الحكومة الإسرائيلية".



وحذّرت الوثيقة من أن أي تصور بأن إسرائيل تتحكم بالمؤسسة قد "يثني" شركاء محتملين عن التعاون.

وفي فبراير/شباط الماضي، كانت وكالة إسرائيلية تُعرف باسم كوغات، هي التي اتصلت أولا بالمنظمات غير الحكومية لعرض فكرة إنشاء مراكز توزيع خاصة جديدة. ووصف الموظفون في الأمم المتحدة والمنظمات غير الحكومية الذين اجتمعوا مع كوغات الموقف الإسرائيلي بأنه وديّ لكنه حازم، مشيرين إلى أن النموذج الجديد قد تم اتخاذ القرار بشأنه مسبقا.

إعلان

وقال مسؤول في الأمم المتحدة: "ظننا أن الأمر قابل للتفاوض، وأُبلغنا بأنه سيكون هناك مجال لسماع مخاوفنا، لكنه تبيّن في النهاية أنه: هكذا ستسير الأمور".

ومع تصاعد المعارضة من المنظمات غير الحكومية، جادل بعض الإسرائيليين المشاركين في الخطة سرّا بأن على الولايات المتحدة، لا إسرائيل، أن تتصدر طرح مشروع مؤسسة غزة الإنسانية، وشعروا بالارتياح عندما أصبحت إدارة الرئيس الأميركي دونالد ترامب هي الواجهة الرسمية له، وفقا لشخص مطّلع على عملية التخطيط. وفي العلن، قلل المسؤولون الإسرائيليون من حجم تورط إسرائيل.

فقال السفير الإسرائيلي لدى الأمم المتحدة داني دانون للصحفيين إن "مراكز التوزيع ستُدار من قبل الصندوق وستقودها الولايات المتحدة".

وفي التاسع من مايو/أيار، أعلن السفير الأميركي لدى إسرائيل مايك هاكابي، لوسائل الإعلام أن مشروعا جديدا، وصفه بأنه مبادرة أميركية لا تشمل إسرائيل، سيبدأ في تقديم المساعدات في غزة.

وفي الوقت ذاته، قام أرييه لايتستون، وهو مسؤول أميركي يعمل الآن مع ستيف ويتكوف المبعوث الخاص لترامب، وكان مساعدا سابقا للسفير الأميركي الأسبق في إسرائيل ديفيد فريدمان، بقيادة اجتماعات مع مسؤولي منظمات الإغاثة للإجابة عن أسئلتهم حول جدوى مشروع مؤسسة غزة الإنسانية وأبعاده الأخلاقية.

وعندما ضغط مسؤولو الأمم المتحدة على لايتستون وديفيد بورك، المدير التنفيذي للعمليات في المؤسسة، خلال اجتماع عُقد في تل أبيب بتاريخ 14 مايو/أيار، اعترف كلاهما بأنهما لا يمتلكان خطة واضحة، لكنهما كانا تحت ضغط من الرئيس ترامب لإنتاج شيء ما، بحسب ما قاله مسؤول أممي مطّلع على الاجتماع.

ونشر مسؤولون إسرائيليون وأشخاص مقربون من المؤسسة شائعات تفيد بأن منظمات إنسانية بارزة مثل المطبخ المركزي العالمي والأمم المتحدة قد انضمت إلى المشروع، رغم أن هذه المنظمات سارعت لإصدار بيانات تنفي مشاركتها.

إعلان

انقسامات داخل الجيش

وتدور تساؤلات بشأن جدوى الخطة وآثارها الإستراتيجية والقانونية حتى داخل المؤسسة الأمنية الإسرائيلية.

وحتى منتصف مايو/أيار، اعترف رئيس هيئة الأركان، الجنرال إيال زمير، في محادثات خاصة، بأنه لا يعرف ما هي المسؤوليات المحددة للمقاولين الأميركيين مقابل مسؤوليات الجيش، لكنه ظل ملتزما بتنفيذ الخطة التي أقرّتها القيادة السياسية الإسرائيلية. وقد شكك ضباط آخرون مشرفون على غزة في دور الأطراف الخارجية في جهود الإغاثة، وفقا لأشخاص مطلعين على الأمر.

وفي الأيام الأخيرة، اتفقت المؤسسة الأمنية والجيش الإسرائيلي على أن تتمركز القوات الإسرائيلية على بعد لا يقل عن ألف قدم (حوالي 300 متر) من مراكز التوزيع، بحسب مصدر مطلع.

واعترف مسؤول عسكري إسرائيلي سابق شارك في صياغة الخطة بوجود انقسامات عميقة داخل الجيش، وانتقد ضباطا قال إنهم "يريدون أن تفشل الخطة" لأسباب أيديولوجية، ويفضلون استمرار الوضع الراهن"، في إشارة إلى نظام التوزيع بقيادة الأمم المتحدة.

أما تمير هايمان، الرئيس السابق للاستخبارات العسكرية الإسرائيلية والذي اطّلع على الخطة، فقال إن أيا من السيناريوهات المطروحة بموجب خطة مؤسسة غزة الإنسانية غير قابلة للتنفيذ.

وأضاف: "مطالبة الغزيين بالسفر لمسافات طويلة إلى مركز توزيع للحصول على كيس طعام يزن 40 رطلا عدة مرات في الأسبوع، ربما قد تنجح في ملعب غولف، ولكن ليس في غزة".

كما رفض فكرة إقامة مناطق سكنية شبه دائمة، قائلا: "دعك من الجوانب الإنسانية والأخلاقية، من الناحية اللوجيستية فقط، نقل الناس إلى موقع دائم، إنها عملية ضخمة لنقل أناس سبق أن تم تهجيرهم مرة." وختم قائلا: "لن تنجح".

اتفقت صحيفتان أميركيتان على أن الرئيس دونالد ترامب عندما استقبل نظيره من جنوب أفريقيا سيريل رامافوزا بدا ساعيا إلى إذلاله، في ما يشير إلى عودة إلى العنصرية العلنية التي اتسم بها رؤساء الولايات المتحدة السابقون.

كان عنوان نيويورك تايمز مواربا قليلا، إذ يشير إلى أن "ترامب لم يرد صفقة في المكتب البيضاوي، بل أراد إذلالا"، في حين كان عنوان فورين بوايسي صريحا بأنه "لم يعد بإمكاننا تجاهل عنصرية ترامب الصارخة".

وصفت نيويورك تايمز -في مقال لكاتبة العمود ليديا بولغرين- اللقاء الذي عقد بين الرئيسين بأنه "غريب"، مشيرة إلى أنهما يشتركان في العديد من الأمور، فكلاهما رجل أعمال ثري وصل في مرحلة متأخرة من حياته إلى أعلى منصب في بلده، وكلاهما بنى سمعته القوية على موهبة عقد الصفقات.

حقق ترامب سمعته في مجال العقارات والفنادق والكازينوهات والشقق الفاخرة، أما رامافوزا فكان المفاوض الرئيسي في المحادثات التي أنهت نظام الفصل العنصري في جنوب أفريقيا، وحقق لحزبه، المؤتمر الوطني الأفريقي، هذا الإنجاز بفضل موهبته الاستثنائية في إيجاد أرضية مشتركة واستعداده لاتخاذ خيارات صعبة وتضحيات كبيرة لتحقيق السلام مع عدو لدود، كما تقول الكاتبة.

خيال عنصري

جاء رامافوزا بمواهبه الكبيرة إلى المكتب البيضاوي لعقد صفقة ما مع الرجل الذي يعتبر نفسه ملك الصفقات، ولكن ترامب استغل الاجتماع للتركيز على ما وصفته الكاتبة بأنه "خيال عنصري عن معاناة البيض في جنوب أفريقيا من الإبادة الجماعية على أيدي أغلبية سوداء".

وذكرت الكاتبة أن الولايات المتحدة وجنوب أفريقيا لديهما خلافات عديدة للتفاوض حولها، مثل قضية الإبادة الجماعية التي رفعتها جنوب أفريقيا على إسرائيل، والرسوم الجمركية، وخفض واشنطن للمساعدات، لكن ترامب -حسب الكاتبة- كان يخطط لشن هجوم على رامافوزا.

إعلان

فقد عرض ترامب مقطع فيديو لزعيم حزب معارض يقود حشدا فيه هتافات تقول "اقتلوا البوير. اقتلوا المزارعين"، لدعم وجهة نظره بأن البيض يواجهون إبادة جماعية في جنوب أفريقيا. ولكن الكاتبة رأت في عرضه تضليلا، لأن السياسي المذكور الذي كان زعيم جناح الشباب في حزب المؤتمر الوطني الأفريقي طرد منذ زمن بعيد من الحزب.

وخلصت ليديا بولغرين إلى أن ترامب ربما يكون قد نال ما أراده من الاجتماع، لكنه لم يحرز نجاحا يذكر في مجال إبرام الصفقات في الفترة الأخيرة، مشيرة إلى أن وعده الانتخابي بإنهاء الحرب بين روسيا وأوكرانيا في اليوم الأول من رئاسته اصطدم بتصلب الرئيس الروسي فلاديمير بوتين، وأن جهوده لإقناع رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي بنيامين نتنياهو بإنهاء المذبحة الوحشية في غزة باءت بالفشل، وأن طرحه الفوضوي للرسوم الجمركية لجلب أقوى الدول في العالم إلى بابه متوسلة الرحمة لم ينتج الكثير.

وكانت رؤية ترامب الخيالية تصور له -حسب الكاتبة- أن قادة العالم سيصطفون لتكريمه في مكتبه البيضاوي المذهّب حديثا، مستعدين لطقس من الإذلال فرضه مرتين؛ أولا على الرئيس الأوكراني فولوديمير زيلينسكي، والآن على رئيس جنوب أفريقيا.

ورغم كل أكاذيب ترامب وتهديداته، ظل رامافوزا هادئا بشكل ملحوظ، وفي نهاية الاجتماع ذكر نظيره بأن جنوب أفريقيا ستستضيف في وقت لاحق من هذا العام قمة العشرين، وقال إنه يأمل أن يحضر ترامب، في ما بدا تذكيرا واضحا بأن العالم يتغير بسرعة، كما تقول الكاتبة.

سلوك عنصري

أما صحيفة فورين بوليسي، فذهبت مباشرة إلى الموضوع، وقالت إن الاجتماع بين ترامب ورامافوزا شكّل عودة إلى العنصرية العلنية التي اتسم بها رؤساء الولايات المتحدة السابقون، وأشارت إلى أن ترامب كان يصعّد منذ أسابيع حملته ضد جنوب أفريقيا بتشجيع من مستشاره الملياردير إيلون ماسك المولود هناك.

إعلان

وذكّرت الصحيفة -في مقال لكاتب العمود هوارد فرينش- بقطع واشنطن المساعدات ثم طردها سفير جنوب أفريقيا لديها، بذريعة ارتكابها "انتهاكات جسيمة لحقوق الإنسان" ضد أفراد من أقليتها البيضاء، مشيرة إلى أن ذلك كان مقدمة لمعاملة ترامب الفاضحة لرامافوزا.

خفض ترامب أضواء المكتب البيضاوي لعرض لقطات زعم أنها تظهر مقابر جماعية لمزارعين بيض في جنوب أفريقيا ظلوا ضحايا إبادة جماعية مستمرة، ولكن الصحافة سرعان ما دحضت الأدلة المزعومة، وأظهرت أن الصور لم تكن من جنوب أفريقيا، بل من جمهورية الكونغو الديمقراطية.

وكذلك دحض رامافوزا مزاعم ترامب بلطف -حسب الكاتب- واستدعى شخصيات بارزة من نسل المهاجرين الهولنديين، لتقديم شهاداتهم رفضا لادعاءات الإبادة الجماعية، وللدعوة إلى علاقات أفضل مع واشنطن، ولكن ترامب لم يقرّ بخطئه، ولم يقدم أي عروض للمساعدة، وبدا سلوكه عنصريا، حسب الكاتب.

وبعد التذكير بالظروف التي تعيشها جنوب أفريقيا، وانتشار الجريمة فيها، نبه الكاتب إلى أن هذا البلد لا يزال، بعد انتهاء نظام الفصل العنصري، متمسكا بمبادئ "أمة قوس قزح" المتمثلة في المصالحة والتسامح.

ولكن ترامب الذي أظهر من خلال تعليقاته جهله العميق بجنوب أفريقيا ظل متمسكا بإيمانه بوجود ضحايا من البيض على أيدي السود، ليتساءل الكاتب: لماذا هذا الهوس بالعرق؟ مشيرا إلى أن كلمة إبادة جماعية لا ينبغي التلاعب بها في عالم يزخر بحالات عنف واضطهاد جماعي تفوق بكثير أي معاناة يواجهها البيض في جنوب أفريقيا.

تحيز ضد السود

واستغرب الكاتب أن ترامب، الذي استنكر فقدان الأرواح بين الجنود الروس والأوكرانيين ووصفه بأنه "مريع"، التزم الصمت حيال القتل في السودان، كما سعى إلى تجريم معارضة قتل الجيش الإسرائيلي لأكثر من 53 ألف فلسطيني في غزة، وهو ما وصفته جماعات حقوق الإنسان والنقاد اليهود بأنه إبادة جماعية، كما أظهر لامبالاة صارخة بتدمير غزة بأكملها، وجمودا في مواجهة محاولة إسرائيل الاستيلاء على المنطقة ونفي أكبر عدد ممكن من الفلسطينيين، وظل يتمسك بخيال غريب لتحويل غزة إلى تطوير عقاري حصري للأثرياء.

وخلص الكاتب إلى أنه من الصعب فهم كون القصص الملفقة عن مواجهة البيض من جنوب أفريقيا مصادرة الممتلكات والعنف هي الفظاعة الأخلاقية في الوقت الحالي، إلا من خلال تاريخ ترامب من العنصرية والتحيز ضد السود.

إعلان

وتتفق افتراءات ترامب على جنوب أفريقيا -حسب الصحيفة- مع معاملته لأفريقيا بشكل عام، فهي قارة وصفها بأنها ممتلئة "بالدول القذرة"، كما تبدو مرتبطة بحملته الداخلية ضد التنوع في الجيش والحكومة والأوساط الأكاديمية وغيرها.

وخلص الكاتب إلى أنه استخدم كلمة "غريب" لأنه لم يجد صفات لوصف ما يحدث في الولايات المتحدة اليوم، من عودة إلى العنصرية العلنية التي مارسها رؤساء سابقون سعوا إلى إعادة عقارب الساعة إلى الوراء في ما يتعلق بالاعتراف بفضائل الأشخاص من أصل غير أوروبي وحقوقهم، وهو أمر يخالف كلمات إعلان الاستقلال التي تعلن أن جميع الناس خلقوا متساوين.

نشرت صحيفة جيروزاليم بوست مقالا يفيد بأن إسرائيل تشهد لحظة مفصلية تنذر بانقسام داخلي عميق وتحوّل نوعي في طبيعة الصراعات الاجتماعية، ويحذر من أن المجتمع الإسرائيلي لم يعد يتعامل مع التعددية كاختلاف طبيعي بل كتهديد وجودي.

ويوضّح كاتب المقال ديفيد بن-باسات، ضابط الاستخبارات السابق في الجيش الإسرائيلي والمراسل السابق لشبكة "إن بي سي" الأميركية، أن الانقسامات الأيديولوجية في إسرائيل تحوّلت إلى صدامات وجودية بين هويات متنافرة.

وأشار إلى أن الإسرائيليين تكيّفوا لفترة طويلة مع توترات بين المتدينين والعلمانيين، العرب واليهود، اليمين واليسار، لأنها كانت تُدار ضمن إطار وطني جامع.

شرخ عميق في الهوية

والآن، يلاحظ الكاتب أن هذه "الفسيفساء" تحوّلت إلى ساحة معركة مفتوحة: الاحتجاجات، ورفض الخدمة العسكرية الاحتياطية، وقطع الطرق، والعنف اللفظي والجسدي، وكلها لم تعد أحداثا منعزلة، بل تجليات لشرخ عميق في الهوية الوطنية.

وقال إن كل طرف في إسرائيل يرى اليوم نفسه على حق أخلاقي مطلق، ويعتبر الطرف الآخر خطرا على بقاء الدولة.

وحتى "القبائل الأربع" التي تحدث عنها الرئيس الأسبق رؤوفين ريفلين: العلمانيون، والمتدينون، والحريديم، والعرب، لم تعد تبحث عن التلاقي، بل باتت تنغلق على نفسها بأنظمة تعليم وإعلام وثقافة ولغة مختلفة كليا.

إعلان

ساحات قتال رقمية

ووسائل الإعلام، يقول الكاتب، التي كان من المفترض أن تلعب دورا توحيديا، سقطت في فخ الإثارة والانقسام، فيما تحوّلت مواقع التواصل إلى ساحات قتال رقمية، تغذيها خوارزميات التحريض والكراهية.

أما المؤسسات الوطنية، كالجيش، والمحكمة العليا، والكنيست، فتشهد تراجعا خطيرا في الثقة العامة.

ووجّه الكاتب أصابع الاتهام أيضا نحو بعض السياسيين، بمن فيهم رئيس الوزراء الأسبق إيهود باراك، الذي يصفه بأنه ساهم في تأجيج الصراع الداخلي عبر تصريحات شبّه فيها الحكومة المنتخبة بحكومة الانقلاب على النظام، ودعا إلى العصيان المدني.

كما حمّل زعماء دينيين وسياسيين من اليمين مسؤولية استخدام لغة التخوين والكراهية.

التدخلات الخارجية

وحذّر بن باسات كذلك من تدخلات خارجية، مشيرا إلى فتح تحقيق في الولايات المتحدة ضد منظمات غير حكومية إسرائيلية وأميركية، تتلقى أموالا حكومية أميركية وتستخدمها لتحريض سياسي داخل إسرائيل.

كما تطرق إلى خطر التدخل الإيراني في الشؤون الإسرائيلية الداخلية، كاشفا عن قضية شاب اتُّهم بالتعاون مع عميل إيراني خلال الحرب مع حركة المقاومة الإسلامية (حماس)، وتلقى منه تعليمات لتحريض سياسي مقابل أموال.

وختم الكاتب مقاله بتأكيد أن التماسك الاجتماعي شرط لا غنى عنه لبقاء الدولة، لا يقل أهمية عن القوة العسكرية.

أفاد مراسل الجزيرة بسماع دوي انفجارات مساء أمس السبت في كييف عقب هجوم روسي واسع بالطائرات المسيرة، في حين تحدثت موسكو عن إسقاط عدد كبير من المسيرات الأوكرانية.

وقالت وزارة الدفاع الروسية -في بيان- إنها ضربت خلال الليل "مؤسسات في المجمع الصناعي العسكري" و"مواقع لأنظمة باتريوت المضادة للطائرات" سلمتها واشنطن لأوكرانيا.

ونقلت رويترز عن الوزارة أن الدفاعات الروسية دمرت خلال 4 ساعات 95 طائرة مسيرة أوكرانية كانت متجهة نحو الأراضي الروسية.

من جهتها، أكدت القوات الجوية الأوكرانية إسقاط 6 صواريخ باليستية و245 مسيرة روسية خلال الهجوم الروسي. وأكدت أن العاصمة كييف كانت "الهدف الرئيسي" لهذا الهجوم.

وأشار رئيس البلدية والإدارتان العسكرية والمدنية في كييف إلى اندلاع حرائق عدة وسقوط حطام صواريخ ومسيّرات على أبنية في عدد كبير من أحياء المدينة، ودعت السكان إلى التزام الملاجئ.

وكانت روسيا شنت مساء الجمعة أيضا هجمات ليلية واسعة بالمسيرات على كييف، بعد أيام من هجمات شنتها أوكرانيا بالطائرات المسيرة، بلغ عددها نحو 800 هجوم، على أهداف داخل روسيا، من بينها العاصمة موسكو.

تبادل أسرى

وجاءت هذه الهجمات بعد إتمام المرحلة الثانية من تبادل عدد قياسي من الأسرى بين روسيا وأوكرانيا، إذ أعلن الطرفان أمس السبت تبادل 307 أسرى من كل جانب.

إعلان

وشملت المرحلة الأولى من عملية التبادل، يوم الجمعة الماضي، 270 عسكريا و120 مدنيا من كل جانب.

ومن المقرر أن تُجرى الأحد المرحلة الثالثة من هذا التبادل الذي يعد الأكبر منذ بدء الهجوم الروسي على أوكرانيا في 2022.

ضربات وقتال

وعلى جبهات القتل، واصل الجيش الروسي التقدم ببطء في مناطق معينة، رغم تكبده خسائر كبيرة، حسب وكالة الصحافة الفرنسية.

وأعلنت وزارة الدفاع الروسية السبت السيطرة على قريتي ستوبوتشكي وأودراني الأوكرانيتين، في منطقة دونيتسك الشرقية التي ما زالت مركز الاشتباكات.

وعلى بعد أكثر من 300 كيلومتر، أعلنت الوزارة أيضا أن قواتها سيطرت على بلدة لوكنيا في منطقة سومي (شمال شرق) المتاخمة لروسيا، إذ قالت موسكو إنها تريد إنشاء منطقة عازلة لمنع التوغلات الأوكرانية في أراضيها.

ندد وزير خارجية ماليزيا محمد حسن، اليوم الأحد، "بالفظائع" التي تُرتكب بحق المدنيين في قطاع غزة، معتبرا أنها تعكس "اللامبالاة وازدواجية المعايير" تجاه معاناة الشعب الفلسطيني، في ظل "تآكل حرمة القانون الدولي".

وجاءت تصريحاته خلال اجتماع وزراء خارجية رابطة دول جنوب شرق آسيا (آسيان)، عشية انعقاد القمة الإقليمية في كوالالمبور، في وقت تشن فيه إسرائيل هجمات مكثفة على القطاع.

وقال حسن إن "آسيان لا يمكن أن تظل ملتزمة الصمت"، في إشارة إلى الحاجة إلى موقف جماعي أقوى تجاه التصعيد المستمر في غزة، حيث يواجه السكان حصارا قاسيا رغم الدعوات الدولية المتكررة لتسهيل إدخال المساعدات الإنسانية.

وسبق أن أكد وزراء خارجية الدول العشر الأعضاء في الرابطة "دعمهم الراسخ" للحقوق الفلسطينية في فبراير/شباط الماضي.

وتتولى ماليزيا الرئاسة الدورية لرابطة آسيان، وكانت قدّمت أكثر من 10 ملايين دولار مساعدات إنسانية لغزة منذ اندلاع حرب الإبادة الإسرائيلية في 7 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2023.

وتقول وزارة الصحة في غزة إن عدد الشهداء الفلسطينيين جراء الحرب بلغ 53 ألفا و901 شخص، معظمهم من النساء والأطفال، بما يشمل أكثر من 3,700 شهيد منذ استئناف إسرائيل عملياتها العسكرية في 18 مارس/آذار الماضي، بعد هدنة مؤقتة استمرت شهرين.

وتعد ماليزيا من أبرز الداعمين للقضية الفلسطينية في المنطقة، وليس لديها أي علاقات دبلوماسية مع إسرائيل.

قاد الأرجنتيني ليونيل ميسي فريقه إنتر ميامي إلى قلب تأخره إلى تعادل 3-3 مع فريق فيلادلفيا يونيون في المباراة التي جمعتهما مساء السبت (صباح الأحد بتوقيت غرينتش) ضمن منافسات الدوري الأميركي لكرة القدم (أم أل أس).

وسجل ميسي، الفائز بجائزة الكرة الذهبية 8 مرات وبطل كأس العالم 2022 ، هدفا حاسما في أول مباراة له منذ أن وجه رسالة لزملائه بالفريق، يدعوهم فيها إلى التماسك والبقاء متحدين، وذلك خلال مقابلة تلفزيونية نادرة عقب الخسارة أمام أورلاندو.

وأنهى فيلادلفيا يونيون الشوط الأول متقدما بهدفين نظيفين سجلهما كوين سوليفان (7) في الدقيقة السابعة وتاي باريبو (44).

وفي الشوط الثاني، قلص تاديو أليندي الفارق بتسجيله هدف إنتر ميامي الأول في الدقيقة الـ60. ثم أضاف باريبو الهدف الثاني له والثالث لفيلادلفيا في الدقيقة الـ73.

ولكن ميسي سدد ركلة حرة في الدقيقة الـ87 ليجعل النتيجة 3-2 لمصلحة يونيون، مشعلا حماس إنتر ميامي، الذي تمكن من تسجيل هدف التعادل عن طريق تيلاسكو سيجوفيا في الدقيقة الخامسة من الوقت بدل الضائع للمباراة.

وقال ميسي لـ"أبل تي في" إنه "نمر حاليا بفترة من النتائج السيئة، لكن علينا مواصلة العمل والتفكير في ما هو قادم. مع تبقي عدة مباريات في مايو/أيار، علينا أن ننهي هذا الشهر بأفضل طريقة ممكنة

لنكون مستعدين لمباريات كأس العالم للأندية".

رفع أحد الموظفين القدامى في أرسنال دعوى قضائية ضد النادي الإنجليزي بعد فصله من عمله بسبب تضامنه مع القضية الفلسطينية.

وأكد مارك بونيك، الذي خدم نادي أرسنال لمدة 22 عاما، أنه فُصل من وظيفته يوم 24 ديسمبر/كانون الأول 2024 بعد أسابيع من مشاركته منشورات تنتقد جدار الفصل العنصري الإسرائيلي في الضفة الغربية.

كما عبّر في أخرى عن رعبه من جرائم الإبادة الجماعية في قطاع غزة التي أسفرت عن استشهاد عشرات الآلاف من الفلسطينيين من بينهم أكثر من 700 رياضي، منذ السابع من أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2023.

وقال بونيك "فُصلت من وظيفتي ليس بسبب سوء سلوك، بل لأنني عبّرت عن حزني وغضبي تجاه الإبادة الجماعية في غزة. لا أشعر بالندم، وعلى أرسنال أن يعتذر وأن يُعيدني إلى عملي وأن يتخذ موقفا داعما للفلسطينيين".

ويرى محاميه فرانك ماغينيس أن "فصله يبعث برسالة مرعبة إلى كل من يرفع صوته ضد الفصل العنصري والإبادة. وتجب محاسبة أرسنال".

إعلان

ومنذ ظهور القضية إلى العلن، طالبت شريحة عريضة من جماهير أرسنال النادي بتقديم اعتذار لبونيك، كما توحّدت منظمات حقوق الإنسان ومناهضو العنصرية ووجهوا رسائل تحث على إعادته إلى عمله.

كذلك انتقد كثيرون ما وصفوها بـ"ازدواجية المعايير" في أرسنال وبعالم كرة القدم عموما، خاصة بعد أن سارع الاتحاد الدولي لكرة القدم "فيفا" والمؤسسات الرياضية إلى إصدار بيانات تندد بالحرب الروسية على أوكرانيا بينما لم تُصدر مواقف واضحة مماثلة بشأن ما يحدث من إبادة جماعية في غزة.

وتبّنى المركز الأوروبي للدعم القانوني -منظمة تدافع عن حقوق المؤيدين لتحرير فلسطين في أوروبا ويشتهر بدعمه لحرية التعبير والحريات المدنية- هذه القضية التي رفعها بدعوى "فصل غير عادل".

وأكد المركز أن فصل بونيك (61 عاما) من عمله جاء بعد حملة تشويه موجّهة شنّتها حسابات مؤيدة لإسرائيل على موقع إكس اتهمته بمعاداة السامية، لكن النادي لم يُثبت أيا من هذه المزاعم ورغم ذلك طرده من عمله.

ولم يكشف أرسنال الأسباب الذي دفعته لفصل هذا الموظف لكن وثائق داخلية اطلعت عليها شبكة "تي آر تي" التركية أشارت إلى أن النادي اتهم بونيك بجلب "السمعة السيئة" للغانرز بسبب منشوراته على مواقع التواصل.

وعلّقت تسنيم أودين مسؤولة المناصرة في المركز الأوروبي للدعم القانوني على قرار أرسنال بالقول إن "هذا قمع سياسي صريح. بينما يُقتل الرياضيون الفلسطينيون وتُدمَّر الملاعب في غزة، يُعاقب موظفو أرسنال لمعارضتهم الفصل العنصري. لا يمكنك ادعاء الحياد وأنت تُسكت المعارضة".

القصيدة هي القصيدة، سواء جاءت عمودية أم من شعر التفعيلة الحر. ويجانب الحقيقة من يظن أن القصيدة العمودية البيتية، ذات الشطرين، تقف بلغتها المعيارية ونحوها وصرفها في وجه الحداثة الشعرية والتجديد في حقل الشعر العربي المعاصر.

فالتحديث عند الشعراء العرب ظهر قبل قرون من الزمن على يد الشعراء المولدين في العصر العباسي، مثل بشار بن برد والشاعر أبي نواس الذي قال ذات مرة: "أستطيع أن أكتب شعرا بلا قافية". وأكثر من ذلك، دعا في إحدى قصائده إلى تجاوز النهج التقليدي لمطلع القصيدة الكلاسيكية الذي يبدأ بالغزل أو بالبكاء على أطلال الحبيبة التي رحلت، حين قال:

قل لمن يبكي على رسم درس واقفا ما ضر لو كان جلس

ثم جاء شعراء النهضة في النصف الأول من القرن العشرين ليعيدوا للقصيدة العمودية اعتبارها ومكانتها الشعرية في الأدب العربي؛ فانتشلوها من حالة الانحطاط التي خيمت عليها إلى حالة النهوض الشعري المنسجم مع تطلعات عصر النهضة وطموحاته.

فظهرت بقوة، في المبنى والمعنى، قصائد كل من محمود سامي البارودي، وأحمد شوقي، وحافظ إبراهيم، وجميل صدقي الزهاوي، ومحمد مهدي الجواهري، وخليل مطران، وإبراهيم طوقان، وغيرهم. فقد تخلصت القصيدة البيتية عندهم من النظم التقليدي المباشر، ولبست ثوبها اللغوي الجديد، بعيدا عن الألفاظ القديمة والمفردات التي أصبحت صعبة ومهجورة تحتاج إلى شرح وتفسير.

إعلان

وبهذا، أصبحت القصيدة العمودية على يد هؤلاء الشعراء الأفذاذ مهيأة لأي توليد وتجديد. فعادت القصيدة العمودية إلى الظهور بأشكال وأساليب مشابهة للموشحات الأندلسية، إذ برزت كتابة القصيدة البيتية ذات المقاطع الشعرية المختلفة القوافي على يد شعراء المهجر وبعض الشعراء المجددين في بلاد الشام. وأكثر ما ظهر هذا الأسلوب في كتابة الأناشيد والقصائد الغنائية الفصيحة.

هذا التوجه الجاد نحو الانفتاح الشعري على العصر الحديث في القصيدة العمودية مهد لشكل جديد من الكتابة الشعرية، وشجع نخبة من شعراء القصيدة الكلاسيكية على البحث عن نمط جديد للشعر العربي المعاصر. فأوجدوا شعر التفعيلة الحر الذي لا يلتزم بوحدة القافية والروي، أو بنظام الشطرين في الشعر العمودي (الصدر والعجز). وفي مقدمة هؤلاء الشعراء المحدثين المبدعين: بدر شاكر السياب، ونازك الملائكة، وصلاح عبد الصبور، وعبد الوهاب البياتي، وأحمد معطي حجازي، وأمل دنقل، ومحمود درويش، وسميح القاسم، وغيرهم.

ولكن هؤلاء الشعراء المحدثين كانت بداياتهم الشعرية بكتابة القصيدة العمودية حتى إن بعضهم ظل، رغم حماسته لقصيدة التفعيلة، يحن للقصيدة العمودية ذات النفس الحديث. وكانت أكثرهم حماسة الشاعرة نازك الملائكة التي أدارت ظهرها في المرحلة الأخيرة من تجربتها الشعرية لنظام التفعيلة، وعادت لكتابة القصيدة العمودية. وأكثر من ذلك، راحت تدعو الشعراء المحدثين على صعيد الشعر الحر إلى العودة إلى أصل الشعر العربي ومنبعه، وهو الشعر العمودي الذي كان ديوان العرب على مر العصور.

لم تلق دعوة الشاعرة نازك الملائكة استحسان كثير من الشعراء المجددين الذين لا يتحفظون على حضور القصيدة العمودية، ولكنهم مندفعون أكثر نحو قصيدة التفعيلة التي يرون فيها انعتاقا وتحررا من قيود الوزن الصارم الرتيب والقافية المكررة التي بالغ في وصفها الشاعر نزار قباني، فشبهها بالحجر الذي يلقمه الشاعر لنهاية كل بيت في القصيدة. وعلى الرغم من هذا الوصف المبالغ فيه، ظل الشاعر الراحل نزار قباني يكتب القصيدة العمودية من حين لآخر، شأنه في ذلك شأن غيره من الشعراء المنادين بالتجديد. غير أن هذا التجديد الشعري ظل مركزا على شكل القصيدة الخارجي أكثر من التركيز على مضمونها المعاصر والحديث الذي يجب أن يتماشى مع روح العصر المتطور على كل صعيد.

إعلان

وظلت القصيدة الكلاسيكية العمودية محافظة على شكلها الجذاب الجميل والأصيل، كما ظلت محافظة على موسيقاها بالقدرة ذاتها التي تحتفظ بها في حفاظها المستمر على بحورها ونظام تفعيلاتها، لا وفاء لأوزان الخليل بن أحمد الفراهيدي وبحوره، بل إيمانا بطبيعتها التي لم تكن ولن تكون حائلا أمام حركات التجديد التي لا تستهدفها من قريب أو بعيد.

في النصف الثاني من القرن العشرين، قامت حركة تجديد جريئة وواسعة النطاق، إذ لاحظ النقاد مدى الاندفاع إلى قصيدة التفعيلة الحرة، إلى جانب العزوف عن القصيدة العمودية. حتى إن بعض الشعراء الكلاسيكيين المتمرسين في كتابة القصيدة العمودية والمجيدين لها تماشوا مع ظاهرة شعر التفعيلة الحر وميل القراء المثقفين إلى قراءتها، فأخذوا يبعثرون أبيات القصيدة العمودية ذات الشطرين إلى أنصاف جمل وإلى أرباع جمل، ظنا منهم بأن القارئ العربي قد بدأ يملّ من قراءة القصيدة العمودية الرتيبة الأبيات والقوافي. وقد أشار إلى هذه الظاهرة المكشوفة الناقد الدكتور عز الدين إسماعيل في كتابه "الشعر العربي المعاصر".

ولكن القصيدة العمودية بقيت محافظة على وجودها، وأثبتت، على أيدي شعراء مبدعين، أن لديها القدرة على أن تستوعب القضايا المعاصرة، وأن تتسع لإرهاصات وتطورات العصر الحديث بكل زخمه وتقدمه ومعطياته ومخرجاته الجديدة. فبات لزاما على نقاد الشعر المعاصر أن يقفوا وقفة طويلة ومنصفة تعطي القصيدة العمودية ما لها وما عليها بموضوعية ومن دون تحيز للون من الشعر دون آخر.

ولكل من يدير وجهه للشعر الحر وظهره للشعر العمودي الأصيل والمتجدد، نقول إن القصيدة العمودية موجودة بقوة وفاعلية، ولن تموت مهما ادعى البعض بأنها على وشك الزوال؛ حيث استبدلت أنفاسها التقليدية القديمة بأنفاس جديدة منفتحة على روح العصر، وبالمقدار الذي يمكّن روادها وشعراءها المجيدين من استيعاب قضايا العصر الحديث وهمومه وتعقيداته والتعبير عنها خير تعبير.

إعلان

ولا يفوتنا، في معرض الحديث عن القصيدة العمودية، أن نستثني الشعراء النظامين للشعر العمودي بتسطح وسذاجة مباشرة تخلو من روح الشعر، رغم اعتنائهم بالزخرفة اللغوية والمحسنات البديعية البراقة والزعيق المباشر الذي ليس له من الشعر إلا الوزن والقافية.

وهذا يذكرني بأبيات شعرية كنت، في وقت سابق بعيد، قد وجهتها لهذا النوع من النظامين المتشاعرين، أذكر منها:

قد خاب من حسب القريض تكلفا ومفاعلات تنتهي بقوافي قد ضل من جعل القصائد حرفة فيسمر الكلمات كالإسكافي

ونظل في انتظار نهج نقدي موضوعي وشامل يحدد عناصر القصيدة الجيدة والمعافاة، سواء كانت عمودية أم قصيدة من شعر التفعيلة الحر.

كثيرة هي حوادث التاريخ التي اختلف المؤرخون حول أسبابها ونتائجها، وبعضها حتى يومنا هذا غامض في أسبابه ونشأته، وفي تاريخنا الوسيط العديد من هذه الحوادث، وخاصة الاغتيالات السياسية الكبرى مثل مقتل السلطان المظفّر قُطز في نشوة انتصاره على المغول وطردهم من بلاد الشام وتحريرها منهم، وتأسيس عهد جديد ستدخل فيه المنطقة إلى فترة من الاستقلال والأمن والازدهار.

وكان من الأغرب أن نَصيره وعضده ومن تصالح معه قُبيل معركة عين جالوت وهو الأمير سيف الدين بيبرس البندقداري سيكون قاتلَه، بل وسيصبحُ السلطان الجديد لدولة المماليك، وهو الذي وصفه المؤرخون بالمؤسس الثاني لهذه السلطنة الممتدة من وسط الأناضول وجنوبها إلى بلاد الشام والحجاز ومصر وحتى حدود النوبة.

ولهذه الحادثة قصة لا بد من الوقوف عندها وتأمل أسبابها، وآراء المؤرخين فيها، فإذا كان العديد منهم -قديما وحديثا- يعتبرون أسبابها غامضة وغير مفهومة، فإن آخرين استذكروا حوادث التاريخ، وتتبعوا العلاقة بين الرجلين القاتل والمقتول من قديم، وقدّموا بعض الإجابات المهمة في هذا المضمار.

من عين جالوت إلى الاغتيال

في أعقاب الانتصار الحاسم في معركة عين جالوت، التي وقعت يوم 25 رمضان 658هـ/ سبتمبر 1260م، وتمكّنت فيها القوات المملوكية بقيادة السلطان قُطز من كسر الزحف المغولي والتقدم نحو قلب بلاد الشام، سارع السلطان إلى استثمار هذا التفوق العسكري وتوجه مباشرة إلى دمشق. وكان لاستقباله في المدينة وقعٌ خاصٌّ لدى سكانها، الذين تنفّسوا الصعداء بعد 7 أشهر من الاحتلال المغولي القاسي، والذي وجدوا فيه من الذل والمهانة ما نقلته مصادر تلك الحقبة.

وقد أمضى السلطان قُطز في دمشق قرابة أسبوعين، في مهمة هدفت إلى إعادة النظام وترميم الجهاز الإداري الذي انهار تحت وطأة الاحتلال المغولي، وقد وصف المؤرخ بدر الدين العيني في كتابه "عِقد الجُمان" ما قام به قُطز من إصلاحات بالقول: "فنظر في أحوال البلاد، وحسم مواد الفساد، وحدّد إقطاع الإقطاعات بمناشيره"، وهي إشارة إلى تعميماته الرسمية التي أعادت تنظيم الحقوق الإقطاعية والسلطة المحلية في سوريا.

وبعد استقرار الأوضاع في بلاد الشام على المستويات الأمنية والعسكرية والإدارية، وبعد غياب دام قرابة شهرين عن القاهرة، اتخذ السلطان المظفر قُطز قراره بالعودة إلى مصر، دون أن يستكمل حملته شمالاً نحو حلب، المدينة الكبرى ذات الأهمية الاستراتيجية. وقد أثار هذا التراجع المفاجئ تساؤلات عدد من المؤرخين، من أبرزهم القاضي والمؤرخ عز الدين بن شداد (ت 684هـ) الذي علّق على القرار في سياق تأريخه لوقائع حكم السلطان بيبرس.

إعلان

ينقل ابن شداد في سرده ما يفيد أن قُطز كان في نيته التوجّه إلى حلب "ليكشف أحوالها، ويُزيح أعدارها من خراب التتار"، غير أن تقارير وصلت إليه تفيد أن الأمير ركن الدين بيبرس البندقداري وعددا من أمراء المماليك البحرية من فرقة الصالحية، وهم المنتسبون إلى السلطان الصالح أيوب، "متنكرون له، ومتغيّرون عليه"، ما دفعه إلى العدول عن حملته ومباشرة العودة إلى مصر.

ويضيف ابن شداد: "فصرف وجهه إلى ناحية الديار المصرية، وهو أيضًا مُضمر لهم الشر، وربّما أسرّ ذلك لبعض خواصّه"، ما يُلمح إلى حالة من التوتر المتبادل وسيناريو أزمة سياسية وعسكرية وشيكة. ويختم ابن شداد قوله: "فبلغ ذلك الأمير ركن الدين البندقداري، فخرجوا من دمشق، وكل واحد منهما محترز من صاحبه"، في إشارة واضحة إلى انعدام الثقة بين الطرفين وتوجس كل منهما من الآخر.

تُسلّط رواية المؤرخ عز الدين بن شداد الضوء على بُعد بالغ الأهمية في المشهد السياسي والعسكري لما بعد معركة عين جالوت، إذ تكشف خفايا العلاقة المتوترة بين السلطان قطز وبعض الأمراء المماليك، سواء من فئة البحرية الصالحية أو حتى من زملاء السلطان من المماليك "المعزية" الذين انتموا مثله إلى خدمة السلطان السابق المعز أيبك وانتسبوا إليه.

وتدلّ تفاصيل الرواية على أن حادثة اغتيال قطز فيما بعد لم تكن مجرد فعل مفاجئ أو نتيجة نزاع عابر في اللحظة التي قُتل فيها في مدينة القُصير القريبة من الصالحية شمال شرقي مصر، بل كانت ثمرة لتراكم من التوجس والاحتكاك السياسي، وربما حتى لمخطط مسبق بين بعض الأمراء النافذين. وكما يقول ابن شداد، فإن قطز نفسه كان "مضمرًا لهم الشر، وربما أسرّ ذلك لبعض خواصّه"، ما يشير إلى شعوره المبكر بالخطر الكامن في دوائر الحكم حوله.

مقتل قطز في نظر مؤرخي عصره

تعددت الروايات التاريخية حول الدوافع الكامنة وراء مقتل السلطان سيف الدين قطز على يد الأمير بيبرس وعدد من الأمراء المماليك الصالحية، ممن خدموا في عهد السلطان الصالح أيوب. وتتنوع هذه الروايات بحسب المنظور الذي ينطلق منه كل مؤرخ.

إعلان

ومن أبرز هذه التفسيرات ما يورده المؤرخ ابن أيبك الدواداري، الذي يُعَد من مؤرخي العصر المملوكي المقربين من دوائر الحكم، وله كتاب جامع وموسوعي هو "كنز الدرر وجامع الغُرر"، حيث يُرجع الأمر إلى مشهد مشين وقع أثناء معركة عين جالوت، حين فرَّ بعض المماليك البحرية الصالحية المقرّبين من بيبرس من ساحة القتال في مواجهة المغول، وهو ما أثار غضب السلطان قطز بعد النصر، فواجههم بعنف، يقول الدواداري: "فوبّخهم، وشتمهم، وتوعّدهم".

ومنذ تلك اللحظة وبحسب روايته، بدأت ملامح الانقسام والعداوة تظهر علنا، "فأضمروا له السوء، وحصلت الوحشة منذ ذلك اليوم، ولم تزل الأحقاد والضغائن تتراءى في صفحات الوجوه وغمزات العيون، وكل منهم يترقب من صاحبه الفرصة".

أما المؤرخ المملوكي الآخر بيبرس الدواداري المنصوري، الذي يُعد من أقرب شهود العصر إلى مجريات الأحداث في كتابيه "التحفة الملوكية في الدولة التركية" و"زُبدة الفكرة في تاريخ الهجرة"، فيرى أن اغتيال السلطان قطز لم يكن نتاج خلاف عابر أو رد فعل متسرع على توبيخ بعد المعركة، كما ذهب إلى ذلك ابن أيبك الدواداري، بل هو نتيجة لصراع طويل ومتجذر تعود أسبابه الأولى إلى عهد السلطان السابق عز الدين أيبك التركماني.

فبحسب رواية المنصوري، فإن قطز كان مشاركا أساسيا في مقتل الأمير فارس الدين أقطاي المستعرب، أحد كبار قادة المماليك الصالحية، وهو زعيم كان صاحب نفوذ وكلمة ومنافس على العرش المملوكي، ويدين له بيبرس وبقية الأمراء الصالحية بالمودة والزمالة، الأمر الذي خلّف عداء دفينا في نفوس المماليك البحرية الذين اضطروا إلى الهرب والتشتت إثر تلك الحادثة خوفا على أنفسهم، ليستتب الحكم للسلطان المعز أيبك أستاذ قُطز وسيده.

ويورد بيبرس المنصوري هذه الخلفية بقوله: "وذلك أنه (أي قطز بعد عين جالوت) رحل من دمشق عائدًا إلى الديار المصرية، وفي نفوس البحرية منه ومن أستاذه ما فيها لقتلهما الفارس أقطاي، واستبدادهما بالملك، وإلجائهم إلى الهرب والهجاج، والتنقل في الفِجاج، إلى غير ذلك من أنواع الهوان التي قاسوها، والمشقات التي لبسوها".

إعلان

ثم يكشف المنصوري أن التقارب والتصالح بين المعزّية وسيدهم السلطان قُطز، وبين المماليك الصالحية بزعامة بيبرس قُبيل معركة عين جالوت الفاصلة؛ كان مجرد صلح تكتيكي مؤقت، أملاه الموقف العصيب، والعدو المشترك المتمثل في المغول، حيث يقول: "وإنما انحازوا إليه لما تعذّر عليهم المقام بالشام، والتناصر على صيانة الإسلام، لا لأنهم أخلصوا له الولاء، أو رضوا له الاستيلاء". إذن تشير هذه الرواية إلى أن العداء بين قطز والمماليك الصالحية لم يكن طارئًا بل كان ممتدًا منذ سنوات، وقد وجد أولئك الأمراء اللحظة المواتية للثأر في طريق عودة السلطان إلى مصر.

ويرجّح المؤرخ الشهير تقي الدين المقريزي في العديد من كتبه وعلى رأسها "السلوك لمعرفة دول الملوك"، أن جذور اغتيال السلطان سيف الدين قطز تعود إلى توتر علاقته بالأمير بيبرس، ويُرجِع السبب المباشر إلى رفض السلطان منح نيابة حلب لبيبرس، قائلاً: "فأضمرها في نفسه، ليقضي الله أمرًا كان مفعولاً".

غير أن هذا التفسير، على وجاهته، لا يعبّر إلا عن جانب من مشهد أكثر تعقيدا وتشابكا، فمقتل قطز لا يمكن قراءته فقط كنتاج لخلاف على منصب، بل يجب فهمه ضمن سياق سياسي ممتد يعود إلى حقبة السلطان المعز أيبك، الذي استهدف المماليك البحرية الصالحية، وقضى على زعيمهم أقطاي، مما أفضى إلى ترسيخ سلطة المماليك المعزية، وعلى رأسهم قطز نفسه، وهكذا تبلورت قطيعة عميقة بين الفريقين، ظلت كامنة حتى وجدت فرصتها للانفجار عند الحدود المصرية، بعد نصر عين جالوت.

ظل التوتر قائما بين المماليك المعزية والمماليك البحرية حتى فرض الغزو المغولي الوشيك على مصر لحظة إجبارية للوحدة، إذ اضطر الفريقان إلى الاصطفاف في خندق واحد لمواجهة الخطر الداهم.

إعلان

لكن هذا التحالف المؤقت لم يصمد بعد زوال التهديد الخارجي، فبانتصار المسلمين في عين جالوت اختفى مبرر الوحدة، ليظهر العداء الكامن إلى السطح، ويتوّج في النهاية باغتيال السلطان قطز على يد بيبرس، أحد أبرز قادة المماليك الصالحية.

وفي هذا السياق، يورد المؤرخ ابن أبي الفضائل القبطي المصري في كتابه "النهج السديد والدر الفريد في ما بعد تاريخ ابن العميد" تعليقا دالا يعكس حالة القلق العامة عقب مقتل قطز، حيث قال: "فلحِق الناس خوف عظيم من عودة المماليك البحرية إلى ما كانوا عليه من الفساد"، وهي إشارة نكشف منها أن المماليك الصالحية كان يهمهم في فترات الاضطرابات مصالحهم الخاصة.

على أية حال، قُتل قُطز، وأُسقط في يد المماليك المعزية؛ لأنهم لم يستطيعوا عمليا أن يمنعوا اعتلاء بيبرس عرشَ دولة المماليك ويثأروا لمقتل زميلهم "خشداشيهم" السلطان قُطز، ولهذا السبب يروي المؤرخ ابن إياس أنه "لما تم أمر بيبرس في السلطنة، رسم بإحضار المماليك البحرية الذين كانوا منفيين في البلاد"، وهو ما يكشف عن حرص السلطان الجديد على ترسيخ سلطته بإعادة أصدقائه القدامى وأهل الثقة الذين لن يخونوه.

وفي موضع آخر، يشير ابن إياس والمقريزي إلى محاولة اغتيال تعرض لها بيبرس من قِبل بعض المماليك المعزية فور عودته إلى القاهرة، ما أدى إلى قتل عدد منهم، وسجن ونفي آخرين. وتؤكد هذه الشهادات التاريخية أن اغتيال السلطان قطز لم يكن فعلا طارئا أو نزوة شخصية من بيبرس، بل جاء في سياق خصومة مستحكمة بين جناحين قويين من المماليك: البحرية الصالحية التي مثّلها بيبرس، والمعزية التي انتمى إليها قطز، وهو ما يجعل مقتل الأخير نتيجة منطقية لصراع طويل بلغ ذروته عقب انتصار عين جالوت.

مقتل قطز في نظر المؤرخين المعاصرين والأجانب

يرى المؤرخ الدكتور قاسم عبده قاسم أن التفسير الأقرب لمقتل قطز هو ما أورده المؤرخ بيبرس الدواداري، الذي يُرجع الحادث إلى صراعات قديمة تعود جذورها إلى حقبة السلطان عز الدين أيبك.

إعلان

فبحسب هذا الطرح، لم يكن قطز مجرد قائد عسكري فحسب، بل كان رأس حربة في تصفية فارس الدين أقطاي، أحد أبرز قادة المماليك الصالحية، وملاحقة رفاقه من المماليك البحرية، الذين اضطروا بعد ذلك للفرار إلى الشام وقضاء سنوات في المنفى تخللتها معارك واعتقالات وملاحقات، وكان لقطز دور فيها، سواء بشكل مباشر أو غير مباشر.

ويلفت الدكتور قاسم النظر إلى أن رابطة "الخشداشية" -أي الزمالة في مدرسة المماليك العسكرية- كانت ذات وزن عاطفي وتنظيمي بالغ، بحيث تحوّلت لدى بيبرس ورفاقه إلى دافع انتقام مضاعف؛ ثأرًا لأقطاي، وانتقامًا لما لحق بهم من إذلال في المنافي، ليغدو اغتيال قطز، في هذا السياق، استعادة رمزية وسياسية لكرامتهم ونفوذهم المهدور.

ومن اللافت أن المؤرخ الأميركي الإسرائيلي روفين أميتاي في كتابه "المغول والمماليك"، اعتبر اغتيال السلطان قُطز حادثة غامضة، يقول: "ما زالت الملابسات الدقيقة لاغتيال قطز وما تلاه من أحداث غير واضحة تمامًا، لكن النتيجة النهائية كانت إعلان بيبرس سلطانا على مصر". هذا مع اعتراف أميتاي أن هناك أسبابا قديمة أدت إلى تطور هذه العداوة، وقيادة بيبرس بنفسه عملية اغتيال قُطز قرب الصالحية في الشرقية.

أما المؤرخ البريطاني روبرت إيروين في كتابه "الشرق الأوسط في العصور الوسطى.. السلطنة المملوكية المبكرة"، فيرى أن اغتيال قُطز لم يكن نتيجة لحادثة مفاجئة، بل كان تتويجًا لصراعات طويلة الأمد بينه وبين الأمير بيبرس، كما يشير إلى أن قُطز رفض تعيين بيبرس حاكمًا لحلب، مما أدى إلى تفاقم التوتر بينهما.

وعلى الرغم من أن المصادر المملوكية تنسب عملية الاغتيال إلى بيبرس، فإن إيروين يوضح أن القتلة كانوا مجموعة متنوعة من الأمراء، بعضهم من المماليك المعزية، ويرى أن سبب اشتراك فريق من الأمراء والمماليك المعزّية -وهم زملاء قُطز في هذه المؤامرة- كان انتقاما منهم بسبب عزل قطز لابن سيدهم السلطان الصغير علي بن المعز أيبك من السلطنة واستئثاره بها.

إعلان

ومهما يكن، ورغم تعدد الروايات التاريخية واختلاف التحليلات حول الأسباب التي قادت إلى مقتل السلطان سيف الدين قطز، فإن جوهر شخصيته العسكرية والسياسية يبقى ثابتا في ضوء ما أنجزه في واحدة من أهم لحظات التاريخ الإسلامي والإنساني، فقد قاد قطز جموع المماليك والعرب المتطوعة بقوة وصبر نادرين، ليواجه التهديد المغولي الذي بدا حينها غير قابل للهزيمة، وساهم بانتصاره في عين جالوت ليس فقط في إنقاذ بلاد الإسلام، بل في درء خطر اجتياحٍ محتملٍ كان يهدد الحضارة الغربية ذاتها.

لقد أظهر قطز براعة استراتيجية وحسن تدبير منذ اللحظة التي تولى فيها مسؤولية الدولة المملوكية بعد وفاة أستاذه المعز أيبك، مرورًا بفترة الفوضى السياسية في مصر والشام، ويمكننا إلى حد ما، تفهّم الدوافع التي دفعت بيبرس والمماليك الصالحية البحرية بل وبعض المعزية إلى الحقد على قطز، فقد كان الأخير أحد أبرز من ساهموا في قتل زعيمهم فارس الدين أقطاي، كما كان له دورٌ رئيسي في تشتيت صفوفهم بعد ذلك.

ومع ذلك، فإن ما يثير التساؤل الجاد هو موقف بعض المماليك المعزّية، زملاء قطز في العسكرية والولاء، الذين شاركوا في اغتياله رغم كونه قائد الانتصار الساحق على المغول، أخطر أعداء الإسلام آنذاك، فكيف يُعقل أن يتحول الحقد الشخصي أو الغيرة السلطانية إلى خيانة للسلطان المظّفر قطز واللحظة التاريخية، وعقب نصرٍ غير مسبوق أنقذ مصر والعالم الإسلامي من الإبادة؟

أنقرة- في زيارة غير معلنة هي الثالثة له إلى تركيا منذ توليه السلطة مطلع العام الجاري، وصل الرئيس السوري أحمد الشرع، اليوم السبت، إلى إسطنبول، حيث التقى نظيره التركي رجب طيب أردوغان في قصر دولما بهتشة.

وعُقد اللقاء خلف أبواب مغلقة، بحضور كبار المسؤولين الأمنيين والعسكريين من الجانبين، من بينهم وزير الخارجية هاكان فيدان، ووزير الدفاع يشار غولر، ورئيس الاستخبارات إبراهيم قالن، ورئيس هيئة الصناعات الدفاعية خلوق غورغون، كما ضم من الجانب السوري وزير الخارجية أسعد الشيباني ووزير الدفاع مرهف أبو قصر.

سياق الزيارة

تأتي زيارة الرئيس السوري إلى تركيا في سياق إقليمي ودولي بالغ الأهمية، إذ تزامنت مع إعلان الولايات المتحدة والاتحاد الأوروبي رسميا رفع العقوبات الاقتصادية عن سوريا في تحول كبير للسياسة الغربية بعد إطاحة نظام بشار الأسد في ديسمبر/كانون الأول الماضي.

إعلان

ويكتسب توقيت الزيارة أهمية خاصة كونها تأتي بعد يومين فقط من زيارة رئيس جهاز الاستخبارات التركي إبراهيم قالن إلى دمشق، والتي تناولت ملفات أمنية حساسة، خاصة قضية تسليم وحدات حماية الشعب الكردية سلاحها واندماجها في قوات الأمن السورية، وهو الملف الذي شهد تأخرا في التنفيذ عما كان معلنا سابقا.

وتأتي أيضا في ظل تصريحات أردوغان الأخيرة حول التواصل مع العراق وسوريا بشأن نزع سلاح حزب العمال الكردستاني، مما يعكس مساعي تركيا لتحقيق تقدم في هذا الملف الأمني الحساس.

أهم الملفات

أفاد بيان صادر عن الرئاسة التركية بأن اللقاء تناول جملة من الملفات الثنائية والإقليمية والدولية، في مقدمتها تطورات المرحلة الانتقالية في سوريا ومسارات التعاون بين البلدين.

وأكد الرئيس أردوغان، خلال المباحثات، أن "أياما أكثر إشراقا وسلاما" تنتظر سوريا، مجددا التزام بلاده بالوقوف إلى جانب الشعب السوري كما فعلت منذ بداية الأزمة.

ورحب أردوغان بقرار الولايات المتحدة والاتحاد الأوروبي رفع العقوبات عن سوريا، واعتبر ذلك خطوة مهمة تهيئ الأرضية لعودة الاستقرار.

وفي ما يخص التصعيد الإسرائيلي، وصف الرئيس التركي الاحتلال والاعتداءات الإسرائيلية المتكررة على الأراضي السورية بأنها "غير مقبولة"، مؤكدا استمرار تركيا في رفضها هذه الانتهاكات عبر كل المنابر الإقليمية والدولية.

وأشار البيان إلى أن الجانبين ناقشا آفاق التعاون في مجالات حيوية، على رأسها الطاقة والدفاع والنقل، إذ أكد أردوغان أن تركيا ستواصل الوفاء بما تقتضيه علاقات "الجوار والأخوة"، بما يشمل الدعم الفني والسياسي خلال مرحلة إعادة بناء الدولة السورية.

وفي المقابل، عبّر الرئيس السوري أحمد الشرع عن امتنانه للموقف التركي، مثنيا على الدور الحاسم الذي لعبته أنقرة في رفع العقوبات ودفع المجتمع الدولي للاعتراف بالسلطة الجديدة في دمشق.

إعلان

من جهتها، قالت الوكالة السورية للأنباء إن وزيري الخارجية والدفاع السوريين سيلتقيان نظيريهما التركيين في تركيا لبحث الملفات المشتركة بين البلدين.

وأضافت الوكالة أن الرئيس السوري ووزير خارجيته التقيا المبعوث الخاص للولايات المتحدة إلى سوريا، توم باراك، لبحث تطورات الملف السوري خلال الزيارة.

في السياق، يرى الباحث في مركز سيتا للدراسات كوتلوهان قورجو أن غياب أي إعلان رسمي أو تغطية إعلامية مسبقة لزيارة الرئيس السوري إلى تركيا لا يعني بالضرورة أنها كانت سرية، بل يعكس -برأيه- ضيق الحيز الزمني للزيارة، وطبيعة الملفات الحساسة المطروحة خلالها.

ويعتقد قورجو -في حديث للجزيرة نت- أن من بين العوامل التي دفعت لعقد هذا اللقاء رفع العقوبات الأميركية عن سوريا، وتعيين السفير الأميركي لدى أنقرة مبعوثا خاصًا إلى سوريا، إلى جانب تصاعد أهمية ملف وحدات حماية الشعب (قسد) في الأجندة الأمنية التركية.

ويلفت إلى أن مشاركة وزير الدفاع السوري مرهف أبو قصر في اللقاء تعزز الاعتقاد بأن قضية انتشار القوات الكردية وقضية "المواقع العسكرية المحتملة" كانتا ضمن أولويات جدول الأعمال، إلى جانب ما وصفه بـ"التقدم الفني في الحوار التركي الإسرائيلي بشأن سوريا"، الذي قد يكون طُرح أيضًا في اللقاء.

وأضاف قورجو أن لقاء الرئيس أحمد الشرع بالمبعوث الأميركي الخاص توم باراك يعكس حرص القيادة السورية الجديدة على التواصل المباشر مع واشنطن، وإدراكها حساسية هذا المسار، في ظل استمرار وجود ملفات عالقة بين الطرفين. وفي هذا الإطار، أشار إلى أن الزيارات الميدانية التي أجراها مسؤولون سوريون إلى تلك المخيمات قد تكون جاءت استجابة ضمنية لبعض التوقعات الأميركية.

أهمية الزيارة

يرى المحلل السياسي محمود علوش أن زيارة الرئيس السوري أحمد الشرع إلى تركيا تكتسب أهمية استثنائية في ظل التحولات الجوهرية التي طرأت على المشهد السوري مؤخرا، لا سيما في ما يتعلق بمسار التسويات السياسية والأمنية.

إعلان

وحسب علوش، فإن أنقرة تتطلع إلى تعزيز التعاون مع الإدارة السورية الجديدة لمعالجة ملف قسد ضمن إطار اتفاقية الاندماج الجارية، التي تشكل جزءا من مسار أوسع متعلق بإحياء عملية السلام بين تركيا وحزب العمال الكردستاني. ويعتقد أن الظروف أصبحت ناضجة لتحقيق تقدم فعلي في هذا المسار، خاصة في ظل ما وصفه بـ"الانسجام الأميركي النسبي" مع مقاربة تركيا للملف السوري.

كما يشير إلى أن أنقرة معنية أيضا بالتوصل إلى ترتيبات أمنية ثنائية مع دمشق ودول الإقليم لمواجهة تهديد عودة تنظيم الدولة (داعش)، بما يشمل ملف تسليم سجون داعش ومعسكرات الاحتجاز إلى الحكومة السورية، وهي خطوة ترى فيها تركيا ضرورة لتمكين دمشق من تولي المسؤولية الأمنية الكاملة على حدودها.

ويختم علوش بالقول إن النتائج المباشرة لهذه الزيارة ربما لا تظهر فورا، لكنها -برأيه- ستتجلى تدريجيا من خلال استكمال مسار الاندماج وتنفيذ التفاهمات الأمنية والعسكرية التي جرى التوافق عليها بين الجانبين.

The young victims, two of whom remain under the rubble, range in age from seven months to 12 years old.

An Israeli strike has killed nearly the entire family of a Khan Younis doctor while she was at work, Gaza health officials said.

The attack hit the home of Alaa al-Najjar, a paediatrician at the southern city’s Nasser Hospital, on Friday, setting it ablaze and killing nine of her 10 children, according to the head of the hospital’s paediatrics department, Ahmad al-Farra.

The dead children, two of whom remain under the rubble, range in age from seven months to 12 years old, said Gaza’s Government Media Office. It named them as Sidar, Luqman, Sadin, Reval, Ruslan, Jubran, Eve, Rakan and Yahya.

Al-Najjar’s husband was critically injured in the attack. He has severe chest and head wounds, including a skull fracture, and is now receiving treatment in Nasser Hospital’s intensive care unit, al-Farra told Al Jazeera.

The couple’s only surviving child, 11-year-old Adam, is also severely injured. He is currently “in the moderate ICU department with his mother”, said al-Farra.

“It is unbelievable,” al-Farra said of the attack’s impact. “You can’t imagine the shock that [al-Najjar] had when she heard about that [attack]. But up until now, she is trying to be near her son and her husband to survive.”

He called on people around the world to “be on the right side of humanity” and speak out against the bombardment. “These children, they have no voice. Their mother … she’s [in shock],” he said. “Please, I ask everyone to be her voice [in] this world. Please.”

‘New phase of genocide’

The UN’s special rapporteur for the Palestinian territory, Francesca Albanese, slammed the attack on the al-Najjar home as part of a “sadistic pattern” of a “new phase of genocide” facing Palestinians in the besieged enclave.

Hamas said it followed a routine of Israel “deliberately targeting … medical personnel, civilians and their families in an attempt to break their will”.

The Israeli military said it had struck suspected fighters operating from a structure next to its forces in an area where civilians had been evacuated. “The claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review,” the military added.

On Monday, Israel issued forced evacuation orders for Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city, warning of an “unprecedented attack”. There has been heavy, deadly bombardment in the area daily.

The al-Najjar children were among dozens killed in Israel’s attacks on Friday and Saturday.

According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, the bodies of 79 people killed in Israeli attacks were brought to hospitals between Friday and midday Saturday. That count does not include facilities in the north of the enclave that are inaccessible, it said.

The ministry puts the overall death toll in Gaza since October 2023 at 53,901, with 122,593 injured.

Ukrainian foreign minister describes air attacks on third day of prisoner swap as biggest in weeks.

Russia has targeted Ukraine for a second consecutive night with drones and missiles, killing at least 12 people as the two countries pursue a major prisoner swap.

Ukraine’s air force said on Sunday that Russian forces attacked Ukrainian regions with 298 drones and 69 missiles overnight, one of the largest aerial attacks of the war.

“Most regions of Ukraine were affected by the hostile attack. Enemy air strikes were recorded in 22 areas, and downed cruise missiles and attack UAVs (drones) fell in 15 locations,” the air force said on Telegram.

Ukraine’s security service reported that at least four people were killed and 16 were injured in the capital, Kyiv.

The country’s emergency service reported that three children – aged eight, 12 and 17 – were killed in the region of Zhytomyr, while another person was killed in the southern city of Mykolaiv.

Four others were killed in attacks across the Khmelnytskyi region, Sergiy Tyurin, the deputy head of the regional military administration, said in a post on Telegram, adding that civilian infrastructure had been destroyed.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported on Telegram that “more than a dozen enemy drones” were in the airspace around the capital.

He reported damage to a student dormitory in Holosiivskyi district, a house in Dniprovskyi district and a residential building in Shevchenkivskyi district.

Meanwhile, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said its forces shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said 12 drones flying towards the Russian capital had been intercepted.

Restrictions were imposed on at least four airports, including the main hub Sheremetyevo, the Russian civilian aviation authority, Rosaviatsiya, said.

Major prisoner swap

The two sides traded fire as they engaged in their biggest prisoner swap since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Kyiv and Moscow agreed to swap 1,000 prisoners of war and civilian detainees each in talks held in Istanbul, Turkiye, earlier this month – the first time the two sides had met face to face for peace talks.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia’s Defence Ministry said each side brought home 307 more soldiers on Saturday, a day after each released a total of 390 servicemen and civilians.

Zelenskyy said on his official Telegram channel that further releases are expected on Sunday.

The Russian Defence Ministry also said it expected the exchange to continue.

The renewed attacks followed a massive wave of attacks the previous day, with Ukraine reporting on Saturday that Russia had hit it with 250 drones and 14 ballistic missiles, while Russia said it was attacked by at least 100 Ukrainian drones.

The film is inspired by dissident director Jafar Panahi’s own experience in jail.

An Iranian thriller film that explores corruption and state violence in the country has won the the Palme d’Or, the coveted top prize at the Cannes Film Festival.

It Was Just an Accident, directed by dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, was crowned at the world-famous festival on Saturday, hours after a power outage briefly threw the event off course.

The festival’s crowd burst into a roaring standing ovation for Panahi, who has endured years of travel bans and prison terms in Iran due to his provocative cinema, often produced in secret. He had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years.

“Art mobilises the creative energy of the most precious, most alive part of us. A force that transforms darkness into forgiveness, hope and new life,” said jury president Juliette Binoche when announcing the award.

On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was the future of his country.

“Let us join forces,” Panahi said. “No one should tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, or what we should or shouldn’t do.”

Partly inspired by Panahi’s own experience in jail, It Was Just An Accident follows a man named Vahid (played by Vahid Mobasseri), who kidnaps a man with a false leg who looks just like the one who tortured him in prison and ruined his life.

Vahid sets out to verify with other prison survivors that it is indeed their torturer, and then decide what to do with him.

Critics have praised the film as a clever, symbolic exploration of justice that blends dark humour with its intense themes.

Iraqi film “The President’s Cake” wins Best First Film

The festival’s Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier’s Norwegian family drama, Sentimental Value, his lauded follow-up to The Worst Person in the World.

Kleber Mendonca Filho’s Brazilian political thriller, The Secret Agent, won two big awards: best director for Fihlo and best actor for Wagner Moura.

The jury prize was split between two films: Oliver Laxe’s desert road trip, Sirat and Mascha Schilinski’s German, generation-spanning drama, Sound of Falling.”

Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for The Little Sister, Hafsia Herzi’s French coming-of-age drama.

Cannes also honoured Hasan Hadi’s The President’s Cake with a best first film award, marking the first time an Iraqi film has won an award at the festival.

The Cannes closing ceremony took place after a major power outage struck southeastern France on Saturday, knocking out traffic lights and forcing businesses to close along the main shopping street in the Alpes-Maritimes holiday region. Police suspect arson as the cause.

Geopolitical tensions were also a constant backdrop at the festival, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the genocide in Gaza and US President Donald Trump’s proposal of tariffs on foreign-made films fuelling discussion.

More than 900 actors and filmmakers signed an open letter denouncing the genocide in Gaza, according to the organisers.

Families of Israeli captives held in Gaza have intensified their criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid large protests across the country, as the expanded military ground offensive and deadly bombardment in the Palestinian territory put the release of their loved ones at risk.

On Saturday, protesters took to the streets in Tel Aviv, Shar HaNegev Junction, Kiryat Gat, and Jerusalem, with members of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum accusing the Israeli government of prioritising its war over securing the return of their relatives.

“We demand that the decision-makers return to the negotiating table and not leave it until an agreement is reached that will bring them all back,” the group said in a statement on Saturday.

Among those speaking at a rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday was Einav Zangauker, the mother of captive Matan Zangauker, who directly addressed Netanyahu: “Tell me, Mr Prime Minister: How do you go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning. How do you look in the mirror knowing that you’re abandoning 58 hostages?”

The mounting anger among families has only deepened in recent days following Netanyahu’s nomination of Major General David Zini as the next head of the Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic intelligence agency.

Zini has reportedly voiced opposition to any deal to bring an end to Israel’s war on Gaza, telling colleagues during Israeli military meetings: “I oppose hostage deals. This is a forever war,” according to Israel’s Channel 12.

“The families of the kidnapped are outraged by the words of Major General Zini. If the publication is true, these are shocking and condemnable words coming from someone who will be the one to decide the fate of the kidnapped men and women,” the forum said in a statement on Friday.

“Appointing a Shin Bet chief who puts Netanyahu’s war before the abduction of the kidnapped is tantamount to committing a crime and doing injustice to the entire people of Israel,” the group said.

Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, says Netanyahu’s new appointment “wants military pressure and escalation in the war on Gaza, and that’s why he was chosen”.

“But there’s a lot of pressure on Netanyahu internationally in the last couple of weeks to try to get Israel to end the blockade of Gaza and stop the war altogether, and the expanding military operations. The military says all the brigades called up are now operating inside Gaza, she continued.

“Family members say the intensified attacks will only kill the remaining captives. But Netanyahu is part of the most right-wing Israeli government in Israel’s history – people who have largely been against any ceasefire deal, largely against any end to the war”, she added.

Netanyahu’s decision to appoint Zini came just one day after Israel’s Supreme Court found his attempt to fire outgoing Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar to be “unlawful”, citing a conflict of interest tied to Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial.

Despite the court ruling that Netanyahu could not appoint a replacement, he proceeded with the appointment of Zini anyway.

The attorney general later warned that the prime minister had defied legal guidance and tainted the appointment process.

The criticism comes as Netanyahu still faces an international arrest warrant request from the International Criminal Court over war crimes committed during the Gaza war.

Arsenal upset defending champions Barcelona 1-0 to win the Women’s Champions League for a second time.

Stina Blackstenius scored in the 75th minute after being set up by fellow second-half substitute Beth Mead in the final at the Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon on Saturday.

Arsenal’s title came 18 years after it became the first, and still the only, English club to win the top club title in women’s football.

Arsenal’s players embraced on the final whistle and ran to celebrate in front of the red-and-white corner of the stands, which were otherwise mostly dressed in burgundy and blue.

“We believed from the moment our Champions League journey started,” Arsenal striker Alessia Russo told broadcaster TNT Sports. “We knew that we had the capabilities. We knew that we could be good enough. It was just about going and doing it. And we’ve done it!”

Barcelona were considered the heavy favourite. They were aiming for a fourth title in five years and to become the only team other than Lyon to win three consecutive titles. The team led by two-time Ballon d’Or winners Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas won nine straight in the competition and blew out Wolfsburg and English champion Chelsea in the knockout rounds.

But Arsenal locked down in defence, except for early in the second half, and created the best chances. Only two superb saves by Barcelona goalkeeper Cata Coll to deny Frida Maanum and Blackstenius kept it scoreless, until Blackstenius finally beat her.

The victory marks an incredible finish to a rocky season for Arsenal, which included coach Jonas Eidevall resigning and being replaced by assistant Renee Seglers.

Since taking over, Seglers steered the team through a spectacular European campaign. Arsenal built its confidence from come-from-behind wins over Real Madrid and eight-time champion Lyon in the knockout rounds before laying low the almighty Barcelona.

The loss was a huge disappointment for the large group of Barcelona fans who filled the stadium that is home to Sporting Lisbon. Blue-and-burgundy shirts and flags outnumbered the red-and-white section, but their calls of “Yes we can!” in the final minutes were not enough to inspire a comeback by the Catalan club.

The closest Barcelona came to a goal was a shot by Claudia Pina that hit the crossbar just after halftime when the Spanish team had its best period. Otherwise, the game was to Arsenal’s liking.

“We are very sorry for all our fans who have come to support us,” Bonmati told Catalunya Radio in the field before the award ceremony. “We will try to do it again.”

Arsenal shook off some early jitters in defence and soon had Barcelona on the back foot. Arsenal’s pressure up the field stopped Barcelona from getting their possession game going, and Arsenal found spaces with long balls down the left flank.

England striker Russo was a rock for Arsenal, using her size to win balls and keep the attack going.

Arsenal thought it went ahead in the 22nd but a video review waived off an own goal by Barcelona’s Irene Paredes when the referee spotted an offside by Frida Maanum. Maanum then went close with a long shot in the 27th that Coll did well to stretch and push over her bar.

Bonmatí was the only Barcelona player who seemed to be in the flow before halftime. Her dribble moves through the middle created a few threats and kept Arsenal on guard in defence. Leah Williamson blocked her best shot deep in the box in the 12th.

Barcelona came out of the restart firing.

Pina hit the woodwork with her chipped shot from a sharp angle in the 49th. Bonmati forced goalie Daphne van Domselaar to get low to parry her shot, and Ona Batlle bombarded the area with three shots from long range.

But Blackstenius set the tone when she had a golden chance when she stole a ball with only Cata to beat, but the goalie got her leg out to block her effort in the 72nd. The Sweden forward would not be denied a second time.

The meeting comes after the US and the EU agreed to lift sanctions to allow the civil war-hit country to recover and rebuild.

Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other top officials in Istanbul as Western sanctions on Syria are lifted.

The two leaders were pictured by Turkiye’s state media shaking hands after an official reception and joining for a meeting at the Dolmabahce Palace in the country’s largest city on Saturday.

Erdogan’s office said the Turkish president told al-Sharaa his country welcomes the lifting of the sanctions. He also said that “Israel’s occupation and aggression in Syrian territory is unacceptable” and that Turkiye will continue to oppose it on every platform, according to a statement on X.

The presidency said in a short statement released through state media that the leaders discussed “a number of mutual files”.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, National Intelligence Organisation Director Ibrahim Kalin, and the secretary of Turkish Defence Industries, Haluk Gorgun, were part of the talks, which were closed to the press.

Al-Sharaa, who enjoyed sweeping Turkish backing in overthrowing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was accompanied by his Defence Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra and Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani.

The Syrian interim leader was also received by Erdogan in the capital, Ankara, in early February, in what was his second international trip after a visit to Riyadh to meet Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The two sides have been discussing deepening bilateral relations and the reconstruction of Syria, as regional allies helped convince United States President Donald Trump to lift devastating sanctions imposed on Syria.

Washington on Friday lifted the first sanctions as part of the drive announced by Trump during his regional tour earlier this month. The European Union has also followed suit, lifting economic sanctions to help with Syria’s recovery after years of civil war.

The new Syrian government has welcomed the lifting of the sanctions, with its Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday describing the move as a “positive step in the right direction to reduce humanitarian and economic struggles in the country”.

Trump’s special envoy to Syria, the current US ambassador to Turkiye, Thomas Barrack, said he met al-Sharaa on Saturday in Istanbul and praised the leader “taking meaningful steps” so far regarding foreign fighters and relations with Israel.

The first of the US sanctions on Syria were imposed in 1979, when Bashar al-Assad’s father, Hafez, was in power. But they were hugely levelled up after the al-Assad government launched a deadly crackdown on protesters in 2011, which triggered the country’s civil war, which killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions.

The sanctions targeted any entity or company working with the al-Assad establishment, including those involved in rebuilding the country.

When officials in the home province of Vietnam’s top leader went door to door recently, pressing residents to sign letters agreeing to the Trump Organization’s plans for a new golf community, Le Van Truong wanted to refuse.

Planning documents promised a “new benchmark in luxury, recreation and business.” Mr. Truong, 54, pictured something else: the uprooting of a cemetery with five generations of his ancestors and the loss of rich farmland that has sustained local families for centuries.

Yet he signed anyway, because, as he put it, “there’s nothing I can do.”

“Trump says it’s separate — the presidency and his business,” Mr. Truong said. “But he has the power to do whatever he wants.”

This $1.5 billion golf complex outside the capital, Hanoi, as well as plans for a Trump skyscraper in Ho Chi Minh City, are the Trump family’s first projects in Vietnam — part of a global moneymaking enterprise that no family of a sitting American president has ever attempted on this scale. And as that blitz makes the Trumps richer, it is distorting how countries interact with the United States.

But American negotiators have been looking for one-way offers, diplomats, officials and people familiar with the negotiations have said, and White House officials themselves have implied this is not a give and take. It is just a take.

“I believe the president believes that the E.U. proposals have not been of the same quality that we’ve seen from our other important trading partners,” Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury secretary, said on Fox News on Friday.

Tariffs are only one arena in which the United States has been overhauling its relationship with Europe, which has for generations ranked among America’s closest allies.

Mr. Trump has taken verbal shots at Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, while pulling back from full-throated support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. He has insisted that America will no longer foot the bill for Europe’s security, and has even suggested that it might not come to the support of NATO members that he says are not chipping in enough for their own defense.

As Mr. Trump remolds the basic contours of the U.S.-Europe relationship, he is pressuring the bloc to make several trade-related changes that E.U. officials are unwilling to even consider.

One day after House Republicans approved an expensive package of tax cuts that rattled financial markets, President Trump pivoted back to his other signature policy priority, unveiling a battery of tariff threats that further spooked investors and raised the prospects of higher prices on American consumers.

For a president who has fashioned himself as a shrewd steward of the economy, the decision to escalate his global trade war on Friday appeared curious and costly. It capped off a week that saw Mr. Trump ignore repeated warnings that his agenda could worsen the nation’s debt, harm many of his own voters, hurt the finances of low-income families and contribute far less in growth than the White House contends.

The tepid market response to the president’s economic policy approach did little to sway Mr. Trump, who chose on Friday to revive the uncertainty that has kept businesses and consumers on edge. The president threatened 50 percent tariffs on the European Union, and a 25 percent tariff on Apple. Other tech companies, he said, could face the same rate.

Since taking office, Mr. Trump has raced to enact his economic vision, aiming to pair generous tax cuts with sweeping deregulation that he says will expand America’s economy. He has fashioned his steep, worldwide tariffs as a political cudgel that will raise money, encourage more domestic manufacturing and improve U.S. trade relationships.

Investors must deal with uncertainty every day. Without knowing what the markets will bring, they try to get good returns without bearing excessive risk.

The classic solution is diversification — holding a broad array of global stocks and bonds. By spreading your risk, you obtain some protection against a disaster in any single holding. Even through the chaos in the markets brought about by President Trump’s on-again-off-again tariffs, well-diversified portfolios have been shielded from the wildest swings in the markets.

This survival strategy makes sense in thinking about your taxes, too.

Every taxpayer must deal with at least two kinds of uncertainty. First, you don’t know exactly what your income will be in the future. And far more irksome, you don’t know what the tax code will be next year, or over the next decade or two. That’s especially true now, because of the likelihood of a swelling budget deficit stemming from the Trump administration’s tax and budget policies.

Consider the budget negotiations underway in Congress. Will they mean higher or lower taxes in the future? There are major disagreements and it’s not clear how they’ll turn out. Yet this much seems evident: There is little appetite in the White House or Congress for short-term tax increases. So you may conclude that your taxes will stay the same or even be lower, and plan accordingly.

House Republicans approved a domestic policy bill to enact President Trump’s agenda, prevailing by a single vote after a bitter fight over tax and spending priorities that had divided their conference.

The legislation would slash taxes, providing the biggest savings to the wealthy, and steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement, while cutting health, nutrition, education and clean energy programs to cover part of the cost. To win votes for passage, Republican leaders accelerated the implementation of work requirements in the Medicaid program and the repeal of clean energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, among other changes.

Republicans in the Senate have said they want to make major modifications to the House product, but it’s still unclear what those would look like.

Here is a look at the bill, and the biggest remaining areas of disagreement within the party.

Cutting taxes

The bottom line: The heart of the bill is a roughly $4 trillion tax cut that would lock in many of the tax cuts Republicans passed in 2017, including lower marginal income rates, a larger standard deduction and a higher threshold for the estate tax, with some tweaks.

The Federal Work Force Cuts So Far, Agency by Agency

The data on this page was last updated on May 12, 2025.

Confirmed cuts * At least 58,566 Employees who took buyouts About 76,290 More planned reductions At least 149,320

Tens of thousands of employees across the federal government have left their jobs, been put on leave or been fired as a part of the government-gutting initiative of the Trump administration and billionaire Elon Musk. Federal agencies have been directed to make plans to reduce their work forces even further.

Confirmed reduction so far, by agency Voice of America (U.S. Agency for Global Media) More than 99% U.S. Agency for International Development More than 99% AmeriCorps 93% Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 85% Education 46% Health and Human Services 24% Energy 13% Internal Revenue Service (Treasury) 11% National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Commerce) 11% Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 10% + Show more Note: Offices or agencies with less than 200 employees at the beginning of the year are not shown here.

Based on the latest available information, reductions could affect at least 12 percent of the 2.4 million civilian federal workers — a number that could grow as more of the agencies’ plans come into focus.

The so-called Department of Government Efficiency — created by executive order — has circumvented a Republican-controlled Congress, which has chosen not to check its authority. Still, it has been subject to frequent legal challenges. Thousands of those fired were reinstated in February, following court orders. But two decisions in early April from the Supreme Court and an appeals court sided with the Trump administration to block the lower court rulings reinstating fired probationary workers.

No official tally of cuts to the federal work force exists. Here are the layoffs, buyouts taken and planned reductions, by agency, that The New York Times has confirmed through verified sources within federal agencies, court filings and press and public statements.

Notes and Methodology The figures above are most likely an undercount. Agencies that have let go of an unspecified number of employees are not reflected here. Outside of the general effort to shrink the size of the federal work force and gut diversity, equity and inclusion programs, Mr. Trump has also targeted specific individuals at a number of independent agencies, many of which are also not reflected here. Most federal agencies have not made verified numbers public, and no centralized database of confirmed figures exists. As a result, The New York Times compiled data from sources within the federal agencies, court documents and press statements. Confirmed cuts: The number of federal workers who have been sent termination notices, fired, laid off, placed on administrative leave, sent home or who were told to halt work, regardless of subsequent reinstatements because of court order or agency reversals. Confirmed buyouts: In February, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management said that about 75,000 workers across departments had accepted deferred resignation offers. Another round of buyout offers was sent to employees in several departments in April. Confirmed buyouts by agency are shown only when known, and may not reflect the total displayed in the summary figures. More planned reductions: Can include a combination of buyouts, firings and layoffs. In some cases, the breakdown between the three categories was not specified. To determine the amount of the proposed reduction in each agency or subagency’s work force, The Times compiled these numbers into a database alongside data on agency size, as of September 2024, from the O.P.M. database on federal employment. More recent numbers on agency sizes were used where available.

President Trump told cadets in a commencement address at the United States Military Academy at West Point on Saturday that they were the first graduates to serve in a “golden age” of the nation that was a result of his efforts to rebuild the military and reshape American society.

Gone were the “nation-building crusades” in countries that “wanted nothing to do with us” and leadership that subjected servicemembers to “absurd ideological experiments here and at home,” Mr. Trump told the group of about 1,000 cadets.

Wearing his red “Make America Great Again” hat, Mr. Trump leaned into his aggressive agenda to purge diversity, equity and inclusion programs from the government, military and virtually every facet of American life, in making his pitch that the nation was worth fighting for again.

He took credit for building the military “better than ever before,” saying it had bolstered its recruitment numbers, morale and commitment to protecting America first. He drew applause from guests at times, such as when he discussed the issue of transgender athletes playing in female sports and hiring on merit over diversity.

The Environmental Protection Agency has drafted a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, according to internal agency documents reviewed by The New York Times.

In its proposed regulation, the agency argued that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions. Eliminating those emissions would have no meaningful effect on public health and welfare, the agency said.

But in the United States, the power sector was the second biggest source of greenhouse gases, behind transportation, according to the most recent data available on the E.P.A. website. And globally, power plants account for about 30 percent of the pollution that is driving climate change.

The E.P.A. sent the draft to the White House for review on May 2. It could undergo changes before it is formally released and the public is given the opportunity to offer comments, likely in June.

Throughout the war in Gaza, U.N. agencies and experienced aid groups have overseen the distribution of food aid in the territory. Now, Israel is set to transfer that responsibility to a handful of newly formed private organizations with obscure histories and unknown financial backers.

Supporters of the project describe it as an independent and neutral initiative run mainly by American contractors. The main group providing security is run by Philip F. Reilly, a former senior C.I.A. officer, and a fund-raising group is headed by Jake Wood, a former U.S. Marine, who said in an interview that the system would be phased in soon.

Announcing the arrangement in early May, Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, said it was “wholly inaccurate” to call it “an Israeli plan.”

But the project is an Israeli brainchild, first proposed by Israeli officials in the earliest weeks of the war, according to Israeli officials, people involved in the initiative and others familiar with its conception, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak more freely of the initiative.

Israel declared this week that it was expanding its ground offensive in Gaza, vowing to seize large areas of the enclave in an effort to force the surrender of Hamas after more than 19 months of war.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said this week that Israeli troops could effectively take control of all of Gaza as part of the offensive, which could take place gradually and in stages. Nearly a week after the Israeli announcement, the offensive was still mostly limited to deadly airstrikes, with slow ground maneuvers.

The threat came during a short-lived round of cease-fire negotiations that has since dwindled despite pressure from the Trump administration on both sides to agree to a truce. The Israeli military has said that Hamas could halt the advance by releasing the hostages it holds.

Britain, France, and Canada issued a rare public reprimand of Israel this week, demanding that it cease its widening military offensive in Gaza. That laid bare growing rifts between Israel and its traditional Western allies and prompted a furious Israeli response.

The Palme for Panahi capped what was widely seen as one of the strongest festivals in years. For some, the selections offered reassuring evidence that the art would continue to endure — and thrive — despite the problems facing the industry. Certainly, President Trump’s recent threat to institute a 100 percent tariff on movies made in “foreign lands” had cast a shadow over the opening ceremony. By the close of the festival, however, the bounty of good and great work had palpably buoyed spirits.

The Palme d’Or was decided upon by a nine-person jury led by the French actress Juliette Binoche. “My friends, this is the end — it was such a show,” she said, turning to her fellow jurists, who included the American actor Jeremy Strong and the Indian filmmaker Payal Kapadia. Given Binoche’s auteur-rich résumé, it is perhaps unsurprising that this jury gave a special award to the Chinese filmmaker Bi Gan for “Resurrection,” a delirious, elegiac journey through cinema history.

The director Coralie Fargeat (“The Substance”) presented the Grand Prix, effectively the runner-up award, to “Sentimental Value,” a wistful, visually playful family drama from the Norwegian director Joachim Trier, who is best known for “The Worst Person in the World.”

“I’m very moved,” a very composed Trier said. Gesturing to the audience, he said that he shared the prize with his actors, including Stellan Skarsgard and Renate Reinsve, who play father and daughter in a story about art, family and the ghosts that haunt each. Like other winners, Trier praised Cannes for its commitment to the big screen.

The Jury Prize, presented by the American actress Da’Vine Joy Randolph, was split between two very different movies: “Sirât” and “Sound of Falling.” Sirât, from the French Spanish director Oliver Laxe, turns on a father who’s searching for his missing daughter in Morocco and ends up stranded in a desert with some ravers. “Sound of Falling,” from the German filmmaker Mascha Schilinski, is a visually exquisite ghost story that takes place over a century on the same sprawling farm.

Every year, as the Cannes Film Festival winds down, hundreds of celebrities and philanthropists gather at the palatial Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc for the amfAR gala, an event that raises millions for biomedical research and also prides itself on being a lavish, fashion-forward party.

That was certainly the case at the 31st installment Thursday, which featured performances from Ciara, Adam Lambert and Duran Duran.

At blustery cocktails in the seaside town of Antibes overlooking the vast blue water of the French Riviera, the Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo, wearing a custom Valentino suit and Boucheron jewelry that he said made him feel like a “peacock,” admitted that it’s a surreal night.

French authorities said on Saturday that a power outage in the Cannes area in southeastern France that briefly disrupted the film festival there was caused by acts of sabotage, including arson at a substation and damage to a transmission tower.

About 160,000 homes in Cannes and the surrounding area were left without power for hours, according to RTE, France’s electrical grid operator, which said service had been fully restored by late afternoon. The outage interrupted some screenings at the film festival, which quickly switched over to its own generators. Organizers said the closing ceremony Saturday evening — when the Palme d’Or, the festival’s top prize, is awarded — would proceed normally.

Laurent Hottiaux, the state representative for the Alpes-Maritimes area, which includes Cannes, said the outage was caused by “major damage to network installations” near the city, including the arson attack and damage to the tower. “All resources are being mobilized to identify, track down, arrest and bring to justice the perpetrators of these acts,” Mr. Hottiaux said in a statement.

RTE said the outage started with an overnight fire at a substation west of Cannes. Firefighters brought the blaze under control, and electricity was restored by diverting power from other lines.

Harvard, the world’s wealthiest university, sued the Trump administration on Monday, fighting back against its threats to slash billions of dollars from the school’s research funding as part of a crusade against the nation’s top colleges.

The lawsuit signaled a major escalation of the ongoing fight between higher education and President Trump, who has vowed to “reclaim” elite universities. The administration has cast its campaign as a fight against antisemitism, but has also targeted programs and teaching related to racial diversity and gender issues.

Earlier this month, it sent Harvard a list of demands that included auditing professors for plagiarism, reporting to the federal government any international students accused of misconduct, and appointing an outside overseer to make sure that academic departments were “viewpoint diverse.”

Alan M. Garber, Harvard’s president, accused the government in a statement on Monday of trying to wield “unprecedented and improper control.” Dr. Garber said the consequences of the government’s actions would be “severe and long lasting.”

The issue is revealing the dollars-and-cents consequences of the tensions between campus leaders and the Trump administration. But the outcome of the underlying debate — over the very purpose of higher education — could shape the country for years to come.

Which schools have been targeted?

So far, seven universities have been singled out for punitive funding cuts or have been explicitly notified that their funding is in serious jeopardy. They are:

Officials at some of the universities have been puzzled by the cuts, which they have sometimes learned about through social media, and insisted that they had taken action to combat antisemitism.

Dozens of other schools are under also scrutiny, largely by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, and are aware that some of their federal funding is imperiled. But much of the focus is on 10 schools that have been identified for particular attention by a Trump administration task force that says it is devoted to rooting out antisemitism: Columbia; George Washington University; Harvard; Johns Hopkins University; New York University; Northwestern; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Minnesota; and the University of Southern California.

Critics of the administration have not hesitated to point out that all of these schools are in states, or, in George Washington’s case, a federal district, that voted for the Democratic ticket in 2024.

Why are the schools being criticized?

The administration has frequently claimed that the targeted schools harbor antisemitism. When a protest movement against Israel’s war in Gaza swept college campuses around the country in 2024, for example, some of the most volatile scenes unfolded at Columbia.

The University of Pennsylvania, which had $175 million in federal funding suspended, said that faculty across seven different schools were affected. Their contracts, according to a statement by Penn’s president, included research on preventing hospital-acquired infections, drug screening against deadly viruses and protections against chemical warfare.

Don’t universities have their own funds?

Yes and no. Most universities are funded by tuition and fees, private donations including endowments, research grants, and state and federal funding. But much of that money comes with guardrails.

Harvard had an endowment fund of $53.2 billion in 2024, far more than any American university.

But that endowment fund does not serve as an A.T.M. for the school.

Many funds have specific restrictions that dictate how and when the money can be used. At Harvard, for example, 70 percent of the annual distribution of the endowment is allocated to specific programs or departments by donors. There can also be legal restrictions on the funds, as well as rules on how much can be used for discretionary spending.

What happens now?

Harvard became the first university to refuse to comply with Mr. Trump’s demands, citing their severe restrictions, including those on freedom of expression. In response, federal officials responded by freezing more than $2 billion in existing grants. But Harvard’s rejection of Mr. Trump’s demands could mark an inflection point in his attack on U.S. academia.

A senior Department of Homeland Security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the students whose legal status was restored on Friday could still very well have it terminated in the future, along with their visas.

The changes on Friday came amid a wave of individual lawsuits filed by students who have said they were notified that their legal right to study in the United States was rescinded, often with minimal explanation. In some cases, students had minor traffic violations or other infractions. But in other cases, there appeared to be no obvious cause for the revocations.

Upon learning that their records had been deleted from the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, scores of students have sued to preserve their status, producing a flurry of emergency orders by judges blocking the changes by ICE.

“We have not reversed course on a single visa revocation,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security Department spokeswoman. “What we did is restore SEVIS access for people who had not had their visa revoked.”

It was not clear how many student visa holders have left the country to date after their records were deleted; facing the prospect of arrest, at least a handful have left before risking deportation. But the Trump administration had stoked panic among students who found themselves under threat of detention and deportation. A handful of students, including a graduate student at Cornell, have voluntarily left the country after abandoning their legal fight.

If it happened to Harvard University, could it happen anywhere?

The Trump administration’s surprising bid to end Harvard’s international enrollment put the higher education world on edge this week, looming as a larger threat against academic autonomy.

Well beyond the halls of Harvard this week, college leaders were shocked that one swift move by the federal government could eliminate their ability to serve students from abroad, a growing population that has infused their campuses with cachet and wealth.

“This is a grave moment,” Sally Kornbluth, the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in a message to her campus.

More than 5,000 miles away, Wendy Hensel, the president of the University of Hawaii, said that it was “reverberating across higher education.”

But on Friday just after 9:30 a.m., the man, a 28-year-old from Italy, ran out of the townhouse in the NoLIta neighborhood of Manhattan and toward a traffic agent nearby, according to a law enforcement official.

The man, whose name has not been publicly released by the authorities, told the police that he had arrived in the city from Italy on May 6 and had gone to the townhouse. Mr. Woeltz, who is originally from Kentucky, had been renting the eight-bedroom home for at least $30,000 a month, the official said.

But when he arrived at the house, Mr. Woeltz and the “unapprehended male” stole his electronic devices and his passport and demanded that he tell Mr. Woeltz his Bitcoin password so they could steal his cryptocurrency, according to a criminal complaint against Mr. Woeltz.

When the victim refused, the two men took him captive and subjected him to weeks of torture, which included beating him, shocking him with electric wires, hitting him with a gun and pointing the gun at his head. At one point, Mr. Woeltz and his accomplice carried the man to the top of the stairs in the five-story home, suspended him over the ledge and threatened to kill him if he did not give Mr. Woeltz his password, the complaint says.

The two men also bound the victim’s wrists, restraining him, and told him that they would have his family killed, according to the complaint.

The Athletic has live coverage of Thunder vs. Timberwolves Game 3 in the 2025 NBA Western Conference Finals.

The Oklahoma City Thunder took a 2-0 series lead in the Western Conference finals Thursday night, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 118-103 at home.

Fresh off his MVP win, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander notched 38 points, his fifth-straight playoff game scoring more than 30 points.

Anthony Edwards led the Timberwolves with 32 points, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the Western Conference’s top-ranked team.

The Thunder and Timberwolves play Game 3 in Minnesota on Saturday at Target Center.

Shai shines

The efficiency and overall offensive brilliance of Gilgeous-Alexander (with an impressive 38 points on 12-for-21 shooting) should be the talking point of Game 2 — especially on a night he was awarded the MVP in front of the passionate Oklahoma City fan base — but the Thunder’s ball movement remains supreme in this series.

Oklahoma City set the tone in the first half, generating 15 assists on 22 made field goals, the majority of which resulted from secondary and tertiary creation underneath Minnesota’s ball pressure. The Thunder finished Game 2 with 30 assists on 45 made field goals. Gilgeous-Alexander should draw the bulk of credit, using his downhill pressure to create passing lanes to ensure the offense wasn’t stagnant, but the Thunder’s unselfishness is what got them this far and should continue to carry them in this matchup.

Their ball movement allows Jalen Williams (who finished with 26 points, 11 of which came in the fourth) to be the aggressive shot maker who thrives as a second option, and it affords Chet Holmgren numerous inside-outside contributions and keeps the machine running. At the other end, the Wolves struggled to keep up, far too often relying on individual brilliance in isolation against an aggressive Thunder defense.

The Wolves have comparable advantages on the boards, and their second unit has more offensive capabilities, but as long as the Thunder can continue finding holes in the zone and creating mismatches organically, the NBA Finals will edge closer and closer. — Kelly Iko, staff writer

The MVP didn’t do it alone

Holmgren, with 22 points, three rebounds and two assists in Game 2, continues to be an underrated inside-outside weapon. He’s certainly not as physical as Julius Randle or Edwards, but his half-court IQ, which has improved each year in Mark Daigneault’s system, is on full display in this series.

The Thunder have ample flexibility with Holmgren’s placement, either using him in the corner and having him be a cutter late in the shot clock, or letting him hover in the holes of Minnesota’s zone.

Defensively, Oklahoma City can trot out lineups with Holmgren manning the middle surrounded with speed and agility, trusting his elite rim protection and rebounding ability. — Iko

Can Minnesota keep the series alive?

For the second game in a row, OKC wore Minnesota down with its ball pressure on defense and ran away with an easy victory once the Timberwolves let go of the rope in the second half. In Game 1, the Thunder sealed the victory by winning the second half by a 30-point margin. It wasn’t that lopsided on Thursday night, but Minnesota still fell behind 0-2 in this series after back-to-back double-digit losses. As of now, the gap between these two teams appears to be fairly sizable. OKC defenders Luguentz Dort, Cason Wallace and Alex Caruso have done a phenomenal job of crowding Edwards every time he has the ball and making him work every look he gets at the rim. Edwards tried to mix things up in Game 2 by sprinkling in a few post-ups and being more unselfish on his drives to the basket. It’s difficult to consistently attack this swarming defense over and over again throughout an entire game.

Edwards finished with 32 points in Game 2, but he’s shooting a combined 17 of 39 from the field after two games in this series. Randle, Mike Conley and Donte DiVincenzo were a combined 6 of 25 from the field in Game 2. The other playmakers on this team have to take some pressure off Edwards. The Timberwolves won’t have a chance in this series if they keep hoping Edwards can get them across the finish line by himself. Playing in front of the home crowd in Games 3 and 4 could help lift the confidence of those supporting cast members. Minnesota will need it to keep this series within reach. — Will Guillory, staff writer

A game of adjustments

One of Minnesota’s big adjustments in Game 2 was to lean more into its zone defense to keep Gilgeous-Alexander out of the paint. After seeing a ton of zone in the second round against Denver, the Thunder looked extremely comfortable attacking the gaps and creating easy looks when Minnesota went to those zone looks.

Two things to keep an eye on when Minnesota goes to its zone throughout this series:

Caruso hit a couple of floaters in the lane by attacking the middle of the zone. This appeared to be a deliberate adjustment the Thunder made, knowing the zone would come at some point. Minnesota has to put more pressure on the ball in the middle of the court. The Thunder had some success attacking Conley when he was one of the two guards at the top of the zone. It’s going to be really tough for him to defend one-on-one in those situations when he is isolated against Gilgeous-Alexander or Williams. I don’t think Finch can play his zone as much if Conley is out there. — Guillory

In the 50th postseason showdown between the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks, the Pacers, powered by Pascal Siakam’s 39-point performance, stunned New York 114-109 in Game 2 on Friday in Madison Square Garden, stealing both road games to grab a 2-0 lead in this Eastern Conference finals series.

This win was not as dramatic as Wednesday night’s, when the Pacers rallied from a 9-point deficit in the final minute of regulation to steal Game 1 in overtime. It might have been just as devastating for New York’s chances of advancing to its first NBA Finals since 1999. Meanwhile, the Pacers have won six straight road playoff games and are two wins away from their first NBA Finals appearance in 25 years.

New York led for large stretches of the first half, but Indiana, led by Siakam, cut into the Knicks’ lead. The score was tied at 81 going into the fourth quarter, with Siakam accounting for 32 of Indiana’s points. The Pacers took control early in the fourth quarter and held off a late Knicks rally to earn the win.

New York’s big three of Jalen Brunson, Karl-Anthony Towns and Mikal Bridges combined for 76 points. Brunson scored 36 and notched 11 assists but missed a score-tying 3-point attempt with 9 seconds left that sealed New York’s fate. Towns, who had 20 points, sat out for a large stretch of the fourth quarter as Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau went with center Mitchell Robinson in his place.

Pacers star guard Tyrese Haliburton finished with a double-double (14 points, eight rebounds and 11 assists), his seventh of the playoffs.

The Knicks will look to get a win in this series in Game 3, which will take place at 8 p.m. ET on Sunday in Indianapolis.

Pascal Siakam’s signature Pacers moment

Simply put, Siakam wouldn’t let the Pacers be denied. The nine-year veteran posted a postseason career-best 39 points on 15-of-23 shooting from the field, 3-of-5 from 3 and 6-for-8 from the free-throw line. He added five rebounds, three assists and a steal en route to his biggest win with Indiana.

He was the Pacers’ only player to score 20 or more points, although fellow big man Myles Turner aided Siakam with 16 points of his own. In typical Indiana fashion, this was a group effort with Siakam, Turner, Haliburton, Aaron Nesmith, Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell scoring in double figures. But make no mistake: Siakam, acquired last season in a trade with the Toronto Raptors, was the one who led it.

As the Pacers have shown time and time again during this postseason run, they are for real. They head back to Gainbridge Fieldhouse with a 2-0 lead and an arena full of fans sure to be beside themselves at the thought of their team being two wins away from their first trip to the NBA Finals since 2000. — Hunter Patterson, NBA staff writer

The stretch that won Indiana the game

The turning point of Game 2 occurred immediately after the end of the third quarter, with the score tied at 81. To begin the fourth quarter, Thibodeau subbed out Brunson, who already had played 30 of the game’s 36 minutes.

Indiana took control of the game during the first three minutes of the fourth quarter, going on a 13-4 run. By the time Thibodeau put Brunson back into the game with nine minutes remaining, New York trailed 94-85.

This isn’t meant to rip Thibodeau. At some point, he had to give Brunson some rest for what he initially figured would be a tight game up to the end. But Brunson’s absence proved costly. — Josh Robbins, senior NBA writer

Another Knicks crunch-time failure

For the second consecutive game, the Knicks’ fourth-quarter execution did them in.

After the collapse of a lifetime to begin the Eastern Conference finals, a squandered 14-point lead with less than three minutes to go in Game 1, a possible comeback in Game 2 became too bumpy.

With more than 30 seconds to go in the game and the Knicks whittling down Indiana’s advantage to 3, Brunson dribbled the ball upcourt. New York would have served itself best by moving quickly, prioritizing any action that could have yielded a 3-pointer. The Knicks didn’t need to chuck up any 3 indiscriminately. If it wasn’t there, they could go elsewhere.

Instead, they went too slow and ended up with the wrong shot. They drained the entire clock, mostly with Brunson dribbling around the perimeter, until he found Josh Hart for a layup with less than 15 seconds to go.

Brunson committed a foul on the inbounds pass, which could have been a turnover had the point guard not grasped a handful of Nesmith’s jersey. Nesmith drilled two free throws to make it a 3-point game. Brunson rushed up the court and chucked a deep, would-be-tying 3-pointer that erred with seven seconds to go.

The Knicks propelled themselves to the conference finals with late-game heroics over the first two rounds of the playoffs. They employ the NBA Clutch Player of the Year in Brunson. But the Pacers have made a habit of storming back late and holding on to tight games when needed. And that’s why they are two games away from the finals.

New York hasn’t operated smoothly enough when it has mattered most. — Fred Katz, NBA national writer

Mitch over KAT? Knicks have a lineup dilemma

Robinson was fantastic again in this game. His stat line might not have been amazing — 6 points and nine rebounds — but he was a force and created a lot of extra possessions for the Knicks. He also played 29 minutes, which was his second-highest total this season, and Thibodeau left him on the floor deep into the fourth quarter in place of Towns.

It was an interesting decision and a noteworthy one; benching a max player like Towns in the fourth quarter of a conference finals game usually is. Towns was a game-worst minus-20 in 28 minutes despite notching 20 points and 7 points.

The Knicks’ starting lineup has been severely outplayed this whole series and in these playoffs. In the fourth quarter of Game 2, Thibodeau decided he needed to make a change. Towns left with nine minutes left in the game and didn’t come back in until the 2:25 mark, when the Knicks were scrambling to come back from what had been a double-digit deficit.

This will be worth monitoring in this series. Will Thibodeau make a starting lineup change? Will Robinson earn a larger minute split? Can Towns play better, especially defensively? The Knicks will need to make some tweaks to pull off a comeback in this series, so something will have to give. — Mike Vorkunov, NBA national writer

New York’s daunting task

Forgive me for being Captain Obvious here, but Game 3 in Indianapolis will be a must-win for the Knicks. No team in NBA history has ever won a best-of-seven series after it lost the opening three games. Entering this postseason, 157 teams had faced an 0-3 deficit, and none of them won their series. —Robbins

After two double-digit losses to start the Western Conference finals, the Minnesota Timberwolves showed they have what it takes to not just challenge but completely shut down Oklahoma City, beating the Thunder 143-101 Saturday night and narrowing the series to 2-1.

The Timberwolves took a 34-14 lead in the first quarter and ran away with it from there; by the third quarter, Minnesota had secured a 42-point lead.

Advertisement

How did that happen? Minnesota shot 57.3 percent from the field to Oklahoma City’s 40.7 percent. The Timberwolves shot 50 percent from 3 to the Thunder’s 31.8 percent. And Anthony Edwards scored 30 points to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s 14 points, until both teams benched their starters with an eye toward Game 4 on Monday.

Thunder must again crack a code

For as much poise and control as Oklahoma City has shown during this postseason — particularly in Games 1 and 2 against Minnesota — Game 3 was the complete opposite.

The Thunder sleepwalked into a fiery Target Center and aggressive Wolves defense, who used an approach similar to the Nuggets — keeping players at the boxes and elbows and rotating quickly to shore up any holes. Oklahoma City missed 11 of its first 15 shots of the game, turning the ball over five times in the first six minutes. They never recovered, trailing by as much as 45 points in the second half and finishing the evening shooting just 35-for-86 from the field and 14-for-44 from 3.

OKC coach Mark Daigneault, desperate to find any sort of rhythm, went deep into his bench, having already played 10 men by the start of the second quarter. But the Thunder were simply unable to create separation for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander or Jalen Williams, who went a combined 7 of 22 from the field. At the other end, a locked-in Anthony Edwards took control from the opening tip, leading the way with 30 points in 30 minutes.

Game 3 was always going to bring a level of desperation from a Wolves team looking to avoid a 3-0 deficit. The Thunder were unable to contain multiple waves of pressure from the game’s onset, and will now look to correct things in Game 4.

Oklahoma City needs to play at a faster pace in the half court. Minnesota’s zone is working overtime to pressure ball handlers and passing lanes, but the Thunder are doing themselves no favors by moving at half speed. In Game 3, the Wolves seemed comfortable bringing Rudy Gobert higher up to meet Oklahoma City’s guards, which should traditionally be an advantageous opportunity. This team is no stranger to the box-and-one zone, the Nuggets used it periodically during the last round, and at some point, the Thunder cracked the code. They’ll need to do it again — and do a much better job containing Edwards — to avoid an even series. — Kelly Iko, NBA staff writer

Minnesota throws multiple defenders at SGA

A change in venue made all the difference for the Timberwolves, whose 143-101 Game 3 win against the top-seeded Thunder gave the conference finals a makeover.

Minnesota’s win could be the difference between overcoming a 2-0 deficit or trying to pull off the postseason impossible: coming back from down 3-0.

Advertisement

The Timberwolves used a red-hot first quarter led by Anthony Edwards (16 points in the opening frame) to hand the Thunder their worst loss of the season after Oklahoma City opened the series with a convincing 2-0 series lead.

Edwards’ 30 points led all scorers as Minnesota also relied on Julius Randle (24 points) and got 45 points from its reserves.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a team-high and season-low 14 points, snapping a streak of five consecutive 30-point playoff games. (He tied Gus Williams’ 1979 streak for the longest in franchise history.) SGA’s nine missed shots (4-of-13 shooting) were more than double his free-throw attempts (four). He averaged 14.5 free throws in games 1 and 2.

The Timberwolves relied on an array of defenders to give the newly-crowned MVP trouble, including Terrence Shannon Jr. The rookie wing contributed 15 points in 13:12 of playing time after totaling six points in his first six playoff outings (20 minutes).

The Timberwolves’ 143 points set a team single-game playoff record and breathed new life into their hopes for making the first NBA Finals run in franchise history. — James Jackson, NBA staff editor

Wolves make perfect, subtle adjustments

We often think most playoff adjustments have to be big ones, like switching a defensive matchup, changing the lineup or deploying a new pick-and-roll scheme. But as Minnesota proved in Game 3, the best ones are often more subtle — and far more specific.

On offense, Anthony Edwards took slightly different angles coming off his pick-and-rolls. Rather than rush into them in a straight line to get downhill, as he did in Game 2, Edwards took a step sideways or even backward to ensure he ran his own man into the screen and gave himself an extra split second to read the rest of the Thunder defense. By starting wide and then shifting to go downhill, Edwards kept Oklahoma City off balance, kept himself on balance and created more room for his now-elite pull-up 3.

"He elevates so much on his jump shot but it is pure." https://t.co/IBJdgmuwRP pic.twitter.com/Rjzmvc3ry2 — NBA (@NBA) May 25, 2025

On defense, Minnesota went against what many pundits publicly suggested and gave Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams more space on their drives. The Timberwolves had crept far too close to the Thunder’s stars in the first two games, allowing Oklahoma City to negate Minnesota’s length advantage and — as you may have heard — stack up bushels of free throws. In Game 3, Jaden McDaniels made it a point to hang a few feet back of Gilgeous-Alexander, all while remaining on the balls of his feet to absorb SGA’s strong attacks. The Wolves’ bigs — Rudy Gobert in particular — stayed back at first, but then shifted up on the floor once Gilgeous-Alexander and Williams accelerated. This change prevented Oklahoma City’s stars from initiating the body contact they thrived on in games 1 and 2.

Now, the Thunder must figure out a way to creep more into Edwards’ space on defense — and more into the Wolves defenders’ spaces on offense. — Mike Prada, NBA senior editor

These smoky, spicy corn ribs are easier to eat than corn on the cob, and more fun, since they’re dippable. Melissa Knific recommends serving them with Sriracha mayo, ranch or green goddess dressing. Just make sure you use a sharp knife and quarter the cobs carefully before throwing them on the grill.

Nothing is simpler — or more satisfying — than making a huge heap of pulled pork for guests to pile into soft rolls and top with coleslaw. This recipe from Margaux Laskey is all that and more: The slow cooker is especially convenient, but you can use the grill or a pressure cooker, too. Set out a side of classic potato salad to make it a party.

This whiskey spritz, which Ali Slagle adapted from the bartender Jim Meehan, is refreshing with lime, a little spicy from root beer, and tastes great with anything barbecued. Set up a D.I.Y. bar with the three ingredients and lots of ice.

Ali Slagle’s cucumber-avocado salad. Christopher Simpson for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.

Ali Slagle’s reader-favorite recipe uses just five ingredients: cucumbers, avocados, lemon or lime juice, scallions and crushed red pepper. The result is a symphony of creamy, crunchy, tart and spicy that travels well, since the citrus prevents the avocado from browning.

“Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning” and the live-action “Lilo & Stitch” are flooding theaters this Memorial Day weekend. But if you don’t want to follow the crowd, it’s also a good time to catch up on some terrific films you may have missed earlier in the year. I asked our chief film critic, Manohla Dargis, and our movie critic, Alissa Wilkinson, to recommend releases worth your time. All are in theaters or available online.

‘Sinners’

In theaters.

The story: The twins Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan) return from Al Capone’s Chicago to open a juke joint in Clarksdale, Miss. That’s when the devil, or rather, an Irish vampire, shows up in this talker of a film.

Manohla Dargis’s take: Directed by Ryan Coogler, this “is a big-screen exultation — a passionate, effusive praise song about life and love, including the love of movies. Set in Jim Crow Mississippi, it is a genre-defying, mind-bending fantasia overflowing with great performances, dancing vampires and a lot of ideas about love and history.”

But nothing won her the lavish recognition she had received with “Against Our Will.”

The book began to take shape after she attended a consciousness-raising session in 1970. She then helped organize a rape “speak-out” and a rape conference and knew immediately that this would be her subject.

In 1971, just as Ms. Brownmiller was starting her research, Pakistani invaders in Bangladesh raped between 200,000 and 400,000 women. The assaults left at least 25,000 women pregnant. Many of them were ostracized by their families, leading to thousands of abortions and numerous cases of infanticide and suicide.

Ms. Brownmiller noted that this pattern had occurred throughout history, but she said this was the first time that the world had acknowledged the atrocity of wartime rape in real time. (It was not until 2008 that the United Nations passed a resolution defining rape as a weapon of war.)

Ms. Brownmiller was among those who took a course in jujitsu and karate, until she broke a collarbone. But she had attended class long enough to learn that a well-placed kick and the strategic use of a sharp knee could inflict serious pain on a man, right where it hurt.

“Fighting back,” she concluded in “Against Our Will,” would be her ongoing battle cry.

“On a multiplicity of levels,” she wrote, “that is the activity we must engage in, together, if we — women — are to redress the imbalance and rid ourselves and men of the ideology of rape.”

Aishvarya Kavi contributed reporting.

“When people hear me sing,” she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1985, “I want them to be happy, happy, happy. I don’t want them thinking about when there’s not any money, or when there’s fighting at home. My message is always ‘felicidad’ — happiness.”

Ms. Cruz died in 2003 at her longtime home in Fort Lee, N.J., from complications after a surgery for a brain tumor. She was 77. Following a tour of her coffin in Miami, masses of fans honored her at a public viewing in New York City.

More than two decades later, her message still resonates, and she remains relevant in what would have been her birth’s centennial this year. She has remained specially visible in Miami, where many Cuban exiles and their children revere her, and the sound of bongo drums are heard in private and public celebrations.

“I see Celia Cruz not only as a legendary performer but as an enduring symbol of cultural memory, resilience and diasporic pride,” Karen S. Veloz, a Cuban American music professor at Florida International University in Miami, said in an interview. “She stands as a cultural icon whose music traverses generations, political borders and languages.”

And beyond Miami, Ms. Cruz has maintained a digital audience too, with more than 6 million monthly listeners on Spotify and her official YouTube channel garnering about 493,000 subscribers.

My husband is sleeping peacefully beside me. Down the hall, the children doze, too — no stomachaches or nightmares tonight. But I cannot sleep. I’m staring at the ceiling, head full of screeching zombies and blown-out cities.

“The Last of Us,” the HBO series about a fungus that turns people into zombies, based on a video game, returned for its second season last month. I have been unwell since. Each episode has left me sleeping badly and haunted while awake, dreading the next Sunday, when I’ll have to sit down in front of my TV and do it all again. I spent the 57 unbearable minutes of Season 2, Episode 2, gripping, alternately, my husband and the giant cushion that more typically forms the back of our couch, occasionally screaming variations on “Dear God,” “No” and “Ugh.”

I know that in the two years since I survived Season 1, there must have been many months when I lived a normal life, not contemplating zombies at all, much less the apocalyptic potential of mushrooms. And yet now that the show is back, I cannot fathom how exactly that worked. If you see me this spring — cheering enthusiastically at my son’s baseball game, making small talk at the potluck barbecue — know that inside, I am barely holding it together.

“Why don’t you just stop watching?” you ask. So do my friends, my family, the waitress who had the unfortunate responsibility of explaining a mushroom dish to me recently. It’s a great question and one I’ve asked myself daily since mid-April. Why am I, a 40-year-old woman whose other hobbies include analyzing Taylor Swift lyrics and shopping for athleisure, so obsessed with a show that is clearly torturing me?

How can Americans best defend their democracy from their president?

In my last column, I recounted three lessons from other countries where popular movements have made headway challenging authoritarian rulers. Critics of President Trump have frankly been fairly ineffective — witness his election and the way his approval ratings have risen in some polls lately — but Trump does give us a great deal to work with. He is immensely vulnerable.

Drawing upon these lessons from my last column, here are what I see as the most promising lines of attack for his critics:

Trump is deeply corrupt. All presidents are accused of shady practices: Remember that President Barack Obama was said to have diminished the presidency by wearing a tan suit. But Trump is a felon who is using his office to enrich himself as no president has in history.

The Times reported that more than $2 billion has flowed to Trump companies in just a month, and some of his ventures look alarmingly like opportunities for influence-peddling. How else do we explain his announcement that the biggest investors in his new cryptocurrency memecoin, $TRUMP, would get dinner with him? Some guests flew in from overseas for the dinner, held Thursday, and acknowledged earlier that they hoped to influence Trump and his administration’s policy on financial regulation.

The Trump family started a different cryptocurrency outfit, World Liberty Financial, that received a $2 billion investment from the United Arab Emirates. Don Jr. is also starting a members club in Washington, with a $500,000 charge to join. And Saudi Arabia and Qatar are investing in Trump businesses, putting money in family bank accounts.

The new Tom Cruise movie, “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” is nearly as exhausting to watch as it must have been to make. Mr. Cruise famously does his own stunts, one of the movie’s biggest selling points. But it’s hard to suspend disbelief watching a picture when you’re thinking about how much Tiger Balm went into its making. Is it possible Mr. Cruise and audiences alike would be better off if he didn’t go quite so hard? You can admire his stamina at 62, but a movie shouldn’t make you feel like you’ve been cornered at a party by a guy who can’t stop telling you how freaking amped he is.

“Final Reckoning” — even the full title is taxing — is a movie so big, it has by my count both three MacGuffins and three set pieces with nuclear bombs that need to be disarmed before their timers go off. (Dayenu, as Jews sing at Passover; a single such blessing, or cliché, would have been enough.) We get to see Mr. Cruise dangle off not one but two biplanes and sprint back and forth across the streets of London with arms pumping manfully when he could have taken an Uber. For several scenes in which the necessities of plot and beefcake delivery force him to strip down to his boxer briefs, we also get to marvel at his perfectly toned senior body, which would be the envy at any recreational facility, not just the pickleball courts at the Villages.

All movie stars, from Mary Pickford to Margot Robbie, are brands, as familiar and comforting in their way as Coke or Irish Spring, and almost as consistent. But Mr. Cruise, an A-lister across five decades now, has transcended even that exalted status. He’s become a genre unto himself, his movies akin to pornography in the sense that they trade not in illusion but in physical, bodily reality. He doesn’t so much act as endure, his stardom adjacent to martyrdom.

“It’s actually hard to breathe,” he recently explained to People magazine, discussing the finer points of hanging off a biplane wing. “You’re so tired. Your eyesight’s blurry. There were times that I didn’t have the energy to get from the wing back into the cockpit, and I would have to almost fall asleep and wait till I had the energy to crawl back because we couldn’t land if I was on the wing. We landed, and I was so cold I couldn’t walk.”

Exercise was fun in our house, because our father was a perpetual kid, wonderful at playing. Certainly, there was a measure of vanity involved. He had a febrile imagination; as he molded us into miniature versions of him, he enjoyed the fantasy that he could live forever through us, his modest experiment in immortality. “Pick a sport,” he said. First, we tried soccer, which didn’t stick, then swimming, which did.

What did we learn, as children, from all of this early training? That being strong was good, for both of us. Perhaps the most striking thing about the physical education my brother and I received under the tutelage of our father was that he trained us equally, without regard for size, age or gender. He set us upon each other for sparring practice. If one of us kicked or punched the other to tears, my father would exclaim, “You forgot to block!” Then he’d laugh his big laugh, dispense fierce hugs and have us go another round.

I grew up feeling that there was value in physicality and that in this arena, I was limitless.

In his way, my father was trying to tell us that muscles deserve more consideration than we give them. We often think about muscle as existing separately from intellect — and maybe even oppositional to it, one taking resources from the other. I’ve spent the past few years writing a book about muscle, and this is what I have learned: The truth is that our brain and muscles are in constant conversation with each other, sending electrochemical signals back and forth; our long-term brain health depends on muscles — and moving them — especially when it comes to aging bodies. But the closeness of muscle and mind is not just biological.

Being a writer as well as a lifelong athlete, I can’t help but notice how language is telling. Muscle means so much more than the physical thing itself. We’re told we need different metaphorical muscles for everything: to study, to socialize, to compete, to be compassionate. And we’ve got to exercise those muscles — put them to use, involve them in a regular practice — for them to work properly and dependably.

We flex our muscles to give a show of power and influence. We have muscle memory; it’s a nod to the knowledge we hold in our bodies, of all things sensory, physical and spatial. We lift ourselves up and jump for joy. We muscle through hard things, which shows grit. Even when it’s a stretch, we still try.

San Diego FC and the LA Galaxy condemned violence after a fight that broke out Saturday night at Snapdragon Stadium following San Diego’s 2-1 win over LA.

“There is no room for violence in our sport,” the teams wrote in a joint statement. “The incidents that occurred following Saturday’s match at Snapdragon Stadium do not reflect the values of either club and are entirely unacceptable.”

The clubs did not go into detail about what happened, but videos across social media and reporting by the San Diego Union-Tribune describe fighting by rival fan groups, including a police response, according to the Union-Tribune.

San Diego FC and the Galaxy said they are working with stadium security and local police to review the incidents.

“Any behavior found to be in violation of the MLS Fan Code of Conduct will result in disciplinary action, which may include stadium ejections and bans,” the clubs wrote.

The Athletic has reached out to the San Diego Police Department for comment.

It’s not the first time violence has taken place at Snapdragon Stadium. On April 2, police and security responded to multiple fights that broke out between fans of San Diego FC and LAFC. And during San Diego’s inaugural home match in March, officials threatened to end the match early if fans did not stop chanting a homophobic slur.

The authorities said they initially believed that Ms. Worrell died in a bungled robbery attempt or by someone in retaliation for being barred from the amusement park by Mr. Worrell.

But on Friday they said they had no doubts that he was behind her death, even though the authorities said he was not there at the time of the killing and have yet to determine who shot Ms. Worrell.

“Jon instigated a conspiracy to commit this murder,” said Jason Seacrist, the lead agent on the case for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

Mr. Worrell, 57, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with malice murder, felony murder, conspiracy to commit murder and aggravated battery. He was denied bond during his first court appearance on Friday. He did not have a lawyer present.

Two men, who had been park employees, were arrested 17 years ago for conspiracy to kill Ms. Worrell. But, Mr. Seacrist said, the charges were dropped after several weeks because of a lack of evidence. One of the men has since died and the other was recently released from prison in an unrelated case, he said.

Sue Donoghue, the parks commissioner, said she expected overall staffing to grow over the next few weeks as students finish classes and summer officially arrives. There are 374 new lifeguards currently enrolled in training classes, according to the department, and returning lifeguards are expected to join up in time for the height of summer. Last year, the city had certified more than 900 lifeguards by Fourth of July weekend, up from just 230 at the start of beach season.

“Last year, we saw a 45 percent increase in new recruits, and we’re very confident that with the changes we’re continuing to implement, that we’ll see that number even grow,” Ms. Donoghue said.

Despite the improvements last year, the city fell short of the 1,400 lifeguards it needed to be fully staffed. Ms. Donoghue said the department was prepared to make accommodations this year, such as reducing pool capacity, if it didn’t have enough lifeguards available.

Still, she was hopeful that incentives like a slightly increased hourly wage — $22, up from $21.26 in 2023 — and a $1,000 signing bonus for returning lifeguards would help. This off-season, the Parks Department even made an effort to spruce up its lifeguard stations, repainting and adding amenities like fridges and microwaves, to make the job more attractive and comfortable.

In a near-empty venue in a near-empty patch of desert on the outskirts of Doha, Qatar’s capital, table tennis stars unfurled deadly slices and killer smashes last week as they vied to be crowned world champion.

Behind the scenes, another battle was playing out with just as much ferocity, as a wealthy Qatari businessman sought the presidency of the governing body of international table tennis, the latest example of Gulf interests trying to extend their influence over global sports.

For many people, table tennis may evoke images of college dorms or suburban basements, but it is one of the world’s most popular sports and a growing commercial force, particularly in East Asia.

Interviews with dozens of the sport’s current and former officials and players have cast light on the rising power of Gulf nations like Qatar and raised concerns about a history of bribery and lavish spending by Qatari officials, both in table tennis and in other sports.

Vietnamese officials are rushing to secure a deal before a 90-day pause on the new tariffs ends in early July. They met with administration officials in Washington this week for a second round of talks. The talks will resume next month, Vietnamese officials said.

The Trump administration wants Vietnam to do more to crack down on companies that are rerouting goods from China to Vietnam to avoid tariffs, a practice known as transshipment.

But the administration is also taking a view of the issue that goes beyond the usual definition of transshipment as it tries to wean the American economy off its dependence on Chinese imports. That puts countries that rely on China to make goods they export under heavy pressure.

For Vietnam, the challenge is proving that what it sends to the United States was made in Vietnam and not in China. In a sign of the awkward position it finds itself in, Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser to Mr. Trump, recently called Vietnam “a colony of China.”

Vietnam was a big beneficiary of tariffs that Mr. Trump placed on Chinese goods during his first presidency. Its trade surplus with the United States swelled to $123.5 billion in 2024, from $38.3 billion in 2017.

Plastic Spoons, Umbrellas, Violins: A Guide to What Americans Buy From China The things the U.S. imports a lot, the things it doesn’t and everything in between.

Tariffs are up. Tariffs are down. Shipping is frozen. Shipping is back on.

In the past several weeks, Chinese imports to the U.S. have been on a seesaw, leaving Americans uncertain how tariffs will affect their lives.

It’s impossible to say what tariffs will do to the price or availability of any particular item, although even the Trump administration’s current level of 30 percent tariffs — on top of previous levies — will certainly make many things more expensive.

But thanks to detailed trade data, we know what Americans buy from China, and how much of it, and thus what might be most sensitive to future swings in trade status.

Here are several ways of understanding what’s on those container ships, based on 2024 data from the U.S. International Trade Commission.

First, the products where the greatest share of our imports are Chinese imports:

Goods Americans import almost exclusively from China ITEM Pct. from

Source: U.S. International Trade Commission

This list is the simplest way to think about which Chinese goods the U.S. relies on most. But percentages aren’t everything. Americans buy so much from China that even goods with smaller imported shares from there could still be significantly affected by tariffs.

Chinese goods that Americans spend the most on ITEM Pct. from

This list skews slightly toward more expensive goods that the average American purchases infrequently, particularly electronics. But the International Trade Commission also tracks how many of each good the U.S. imports.

In that list, you can see Americans’ well-documented reliance on China for plastic products.

Many of America’s major imports from China are consumer goods: things you buy for yourself, like clothes, housewares or entertainment. Drill down into those categories and specific products stand out.

For example, American wardrobes are somewhat dependent on China: about a fifth of U.S. clothing imports. But a majority of neckties and gloves and pantyhose are imported from China.

The U.S. is more reliant on China for things made with polyester and nylon (like pantyhose) than for those made with cotton.

Athletes, especially racket-sport players, are also dependent on China:

There are also consumer-goods categories whose “Made in China” status may not be as well known. For example, the U.S. gets a lot of its imported string instruments — such as violins and cellos — from China.

The Japanese company Yamaha manufactures some of its instruments in China, including trumpets and drums.

The U.S. relies heavily on Chinese imports to build electric vehicles in particular: Some 70 percent of its imported lithium-ion batteries are from China.

Even batteries made in the U.S. often rely on raw materials from China, particularly graphite. (China tightened its export controls on graphite at the end of last year, so this year’s numbers could end up looking very different.)

Mr. Trump’s newest tariffs are not the only levies imposed on Chinese goods, and there’s a complicated interplay of which tariffs apply to which products. Some goods that a lot of Americans buy received exemptions from the latest tariffs (though perhaps not future ones), including one item the U.S. imports almost exclusively from China: children’s books.

That’s a window into what Americans buy from China. But for some imports, the U.S. doesn’t rely on China. It’s a list that includes large vehicles, precious metals and tomatoes, all of which America imports largely from other countries.

Includes categories where less than 0.5 percent of goods are from China.

It’s also worth noting what America exports to China. Though the U.S. sends fewer goods to China than it receives, these could still be affected in a trade war. (China has been instituting its own exemptions, which are broader than those of the U.S.)

The invitees for President Trump’s private dinner for customers of his cryptocurrency business on Thursday included a Chinese billionaire fighting a lawsuit from U.S. regulators, a lawyer for Justice Clarence Thomas and a former basketball star, according to a guest list obtained by The New York Times and social media posts.

The dinner, at which Mr. Trump gave remarks, was an extraordinary moment in which the president leveraged his position to make money — for his crypto business and for his Virginia golf club, which hosted the event.

The event’s invited guests were not known publicly beforehand, even to each other. They were identified only by the pseudonyms they used on the electronic wallets where they kept their $TRUMP memecoins. Most had gained an invitation by becoming one of the top 220 holders of that memecoin over a certain period of time. The top 25 of those were given V.I.P. status and afforded a more intimate gathering before the dinner and an unofficial tour of the White House on Friday.

News Analysis

Nearly $5 billion in goods and services cross the Atlantic between the United States and European Union every single day, by E.U. estimates.

The European Union has been following tried-and-true rules of global commerce as it tries to negotiate with the Trump administration to avert painful tariffs on cars, pharmaceuticals and just about everything else.

The problem? President Trump is ripping up that rule book.

Mr. Trump announced in a Truth Social post on Friday morning that he is recommending a 50 percent tariff on European imports as of June 1, claiming that the bloc’s trade barriers, taxes, corporate penalties and other policies had contributed to a trade imbalance with the United States that was “totally unacceptable.”

“The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on TRADE, has been very difficult to deal with,” Mr. Trump wrote, adding, “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!”

The surprise announcement comes after months of back-and-forth talks between the two enormous economies that have made, as Mr. Trump suggested, limited headway.

European officials have approached negotiations as though they are reasoning with an ally. But they have met with a Trump administration that sees this less as a chance for two geopolitical friends to seek a mutually beneficial solution — and rather as an opportunity to pressure a commercial rival into making concessions.

Mr. Trump has imposed round after round of tariffs on the 27-nation economic bloc and the world since taking office in January. He has hit sectors like steel and aluminum and cars with specific tariffs, while also threatening to place higher across-the-board levies on most American trading partners. But back in April, he announced that he would pause that latter category for a 90-day period as countries negotiated deals.

The president’s announcement, if implemented, would not only hit the European Union with those across-the-board tariffs before the end of that planned negotiating period, it would also more than double the rate the bloc expected.

In talks, the bloc’s policymakers have suggested what they have billed as win-win solutions, including a plan to drop tariffs on industrial products to zero and buying more American gas.

But American negotiators have been looking for one-way offers, diplomats, officials and people familiar with the negotiations have said, and White House officials themselves have implied this is not a give and take. It is just a take.

“I believe the president believes that the E.U. proposals have not been of the same quality that we’ve seen from our other important trading partners,” Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury secretary, said on Fox News on Friday.

Tariffs are only one arena in which the United States has been overhauling its relationship with Europe, which has for generations ranked among America’s closest allies.

Mr. Trump has taken verbal shots at Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, while pulling back from full-throated support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. He has insisted that America will no longer foot the bill for Europe’s security, and has even suggested that it might not come to the support of NATO members that he says are not chipping in enough for their own defense.

As Mr. Trump remolds the basic contours of the U.S.-Europe relationship, he is pressuring the bloc to make several trade-related changes that E.U. officials are unwilling to even consider.

Mr. Trump wants European nations to nix their Value-Added Tax system, a key consumption tax — which negotiators say is not on the table. Administration officials have suggested that they want Europe to change food sanitation standards so that it imports more American beef — another non-starter.

Administration officials have also come after Europe for its regulation of digital services and social media companies — also policies that European officials have been unwilling to reconsider.

But unlike smaller economies like Britain, which has already struck a deal with the Trump administration, the European Union has a big enough trading relationship with the United States that its officials have believed that they had some amount of leverage.

Europe’s trading relationship with the United States is the largest in the world, by some measures. Nearly $5 billion in goods and services cross the Atlantic between the two partners every single day, by E.U. estimates. And while Europe sells America more goods than it buys — the goods trade deficit was about $180 billion in 2023 — it purchases more American services than it sells back.

Maros Sefcovic, the E.U. trade commissioner, and his colleagues have traveled repeatedly to Washington to talk with Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, and Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative.

Mr. Sefcovic talked to his counterparts in the United States on Friday after Mr. Trump’s threat, and posted on social media afterward that “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.”

Besides making offers, European officials have also prepared two waves of countermeasures that would hit American goods coming into Europe with higher tariffs if no deal is reached. The second set of countertariffs — which would target 95 billion euros-worth of American goods that could range from bourbon to soybeans — is still being refined.

Neither Europe’s offers nor its threats have been greeted warmly by the administration.

“There are some countries that are impossible, like the European Union,” Mr. Lutnick said at an Axios event earlier this week.

Analysts in Washington and Brussels said on Friday that they viewed the 50 percent tariff as a negotiating tactic. But how the feud might resolve was unclear.

“There is some serious daylight between the E.U.’s expectations of what it can achieve in these talks and what the U.S. administration is willing to give,” said Jörn Fleck, senior director with the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council in Washington.

If 50 percent tariffs were to actually take effect and last, they would be crushing for the bloc. The European Union currently faces 10 percent across-the-board tariffs on its exports, like other nations. After the 90-day pause expires in July, the bloc was expecting to face 20 percent tariffs, based on what the United States had previously announced.

European officials have been holding out hope that tariffs would instead return to something like what had prevailed before this year, a reduction from even the current 10 percent rate. But that is not what Mr. Trump’s team is currently offering.

“The president will decide if they’ve made us an offer worthy of modifying their tariff terms,” Mr. Lutnick said earlier this week. “If they haven’t made us an offer that modifies it, the president will write them a letter saying, ‘Dear country A, we deeply appreciate doing business with you. Here’s your tariff rate.’”

And, he said, “there will be no floor below 10.”

A federal judge ordered the Trump administration late Friday night to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who had been deported to Mexico, despite fearing persecution and having told U.S. authorities about the violence he had experienced there.

The man, known by the initials O.C.G., is gay and is now living in hiding in Guatemala, “in constant panic and constant fear,” according to a sworn declaration. “I can’t be gay here, which means I cannot be myself.”

The ruling, by Judge Brian E. Murphy of the U.S. District Court in Boston, criticized the government for first claiming that O.C.G. had said he was not afraid of being sent to Mexico, where he said he was raped and held captive, but later admitting that it was “unable to identify” the officials to whom he had supposedly made that statement.

Judge Murphy also found that O.C.G. was likely to “succeed in showing that his removal lacked any semblance of due process.”

A bipartisan group of senators on Friday arrived in Ottawa seeking to stabilize the United States’ relationship with Canada, determined to mend a once-tight alliance that President Trump has tested in recent months with tariffs and tough talk.

Sporting lapel pins of the American and Canadian flags and red and white friendship bracelets, the group — four Democrats and a lone Republican — met with Prime Minister Mark Carney and senior Canadian officials in a bid to defuse the tension that has built up in recent months after economic pressure and political rhetoric from Mr. Trump that many Canadians have viewed as both destabilizing and deeply insulting.

“We know how important Canada is to our states and how important the United States and the Canadian relationship is to both countries,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, after a day of meetings with government officials and business leaders.

She was part of a delegation that included fellow Democratic Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Peter Welch of Vermont, as well as Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, the sole Republican.

The latest confrontation between Harvard University and the Trump administration began last month with a far-reaching demand for data on international students.

Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, sent a letter to Harvard requesting, among other things, coursework for every international student and information on any student visa holder involved in misconduct or illegal activity.

Harvard rebuffed parts of the request, and the Trump administration retaliated on Thursday. In one of its most aggressive moves so far against the university, the government said Harvard could no longer enroll any international students, who account for about one-fourth of its total enrollment.

It also expanded its request for records to include any videos of international students, on campus or off, involved in protests or illegal or dangerous activity.

A federal judge has already blocked the move for now, but my colleague Michael Schmidt, an investigative reporter who has been covering every twist in this story, tells me the damage may already be done. Today, he explained just how dire Harvard’s predicament has become — and why the federal government’s power over the nearly 400-year-old institution is even greater than he had appreciated.

JB: You have long covered the way Trump has used the power of the government to target his perceived enemies. How is this time different?

MS: There’s been an audacity and creativity to the way that Trump has tried to use his power in the second term, and this is the latest example. Coming into this, we concentrated on his threats to lock up his enemies, like Liz Cheney or James Comey. The use of the government’s power for purely political ends has manifested itself in ways that I think go beyond what we had imagined, and even beyond what Project 2025 contemplated.

Today, a judge temporarily blocked this Trump effort to bar international students from Harvard. Is that good news for Harvard? Is this over?

It’s not over at all. For now, it allows foreign students to continue to attend Harvard. But what it doesn’t remove is the question of what’s going to happen.

“This became the Belichick girlfriend story of politics,” he quipped at one point, referring to the recent media attention around the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill football coach. “It just keeps going and going.”

After his discharge from Walter Reed in 2023, Mr. Fetterman embraced a role as a stigma-busting spokesman for the power of treatment and used his challenges as an opportunity to bridge partisan politics.

“Red or blue, if you have depression, get help, please,” he said in an interview later that year.

These days, Mr. Fetterman is not so sure it was wise to talk about any of that. He doesn’t think it’s anyone’s business whether, as some former aides have suggested, he is or isn’t following the regimen that his doctors recommended to treat his mental health issues. He sings the praises only of Mounjaro, the injectable diabetes and weight-loss drug that he credits with making him feel “a decade younger, as well as clearer-headed and more optimistic than I’d been in years.”

Still, there have been big gaps in his attendance.

Since his return from Walter Reed, Mr. Fetterman has missed more votes than all but two senators, both of whom were campaigning for president last year: Republicans JD Vance of Ohio and Tim Scott of South Carolina, according to a New York Times analysis of Senate roll call records.

This year, the analysis found, Mr. Fetterman also has missed more votes than all but two of his colleagues: Senators Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont. Ms. Murray has been absent to care for her ailing husband, while Mr. Sanders has been on his “Fighting Oligarchy Tour,” speaking out against President Trump and drawing a total of 265,000 people to events across 12 states so far, according to a spokeswoman.

With the largest and deadliest conflict in Europe since the end of World War II now in its fourth year, the scale of the devastation wreaked by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues to mount.

The front line is a place of ghastly violence where hundreds of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or wounded, according to conservative Western estimates. The list of Ukrainian cities and towns largely leveled to the ground by Russian bombs and artillery grows with each passing month.

Russian forces have moved forward in small increments, sustaining a staggering number of casualties to take cities like Avdiivka, which they captured last year. Ukraine has been able to slow the advance by committing some of its limited reserves to counterattacks, including into the western Russian region of Kursk in a surprise assault, and in the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk in recent weeks.

President Trump has recently signaled a thawing relationship between the United States and Russia, in what he characterized as the beginning of a negotiation to end the war. That has raised concerns he could favor Russia in a peace deal while leaving Ukraine on the sidelines.

Negotiations to end the war will shape the future of Ukraine, and the recent developments mean some of its territory is likely to remain under Russian occupation.

Away from the front, millions of Ukrainians have spent hours in bomb shelters as Russia rains down missiles and drones on military units and civilians across the nation. Ukraine’s energy grid, severely damaged, is working but sporadically. Thousands of schools, hospitals and cultural institutions have been damaged or destroyed. Millions of people have lost their homes.

For all that time, photographers with The New York Times and other news organizations have chronicled the war, capturing a slice of how soldiers and civilians have experienced it. Some images, our photographers say, will never leave them.

The European Union approved a new package of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday, targeting covert oil exports, days after the top E.U. official announced plans for a further set of even tougher restrictions.

The point is to intensify Russia’s economic pain — and by doing so, to prod President Vladimir V. Putin toward peace talks to end the war in Ukraine. The push comes as questions mount about how the United States will approach future sanctions.

After a call between President Trump and Mr. Putin on Monday, the White House backed off its demand that Russia declare an immediate cease-fire. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said at a news conference that it was unclear whether the United States would join with Europe in stepping up sanctions.

E.U. nations have imposed extensive sanctions on Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The ones they approved on Tuesday are the 17th set. These take aim at Russia’s so-called shadow fleet — old tanker ships that Moscow uses to covertly transport and sell its oil around the world.

From where Olena Boiko lives in Sumy, a Ukrainian city under relentless bombardment by Russia, the idea that President Trump may be stepping back from his role trying to end the war in Ukraine was disappointing but hardly surprising.

Mr. Trump’s diplomatic effort was a “theatrical performance that has nothing to do with the reality of trenches or bomb shelters,” Ms. Boiko said on Tuesday.

She and her family, she said, had suffered immense losses and desperately wanted the war to end. “My daughters and I have lost the most precious things to this war — my husband, their father, and my childhood home, which was destroyed down to its foundation,” she said.

Mr. Trump took office declaring he could swiftly end the war. But after a phone call on Monday with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Trump suggested he was prepared to step back.

Ukraine fired hundreds of exploding drones at Russia beginning on Tuesday night and continuing into Thursday morning, in one of the largest attacks in more than three years of war, Russian authorities said.

The Russian Ministry of Defense reported that 485 drones were shot down, 63 of them over the Moscow region. In total, 10 Russian regions were targeted in a barrage that lasted for some 36 hours, the authorities said. In Tula, one of the drones struck the roof of a multistory building.

It was not clear how much damage was caused by the strikes. Ukraine has not commented on the attack.

The drone swarm came just days after a telephone call between President Vladimir V. Putin and President Trump resulted in no breakthroughs in negotiating a peace deal. Since Mr. Trump took office and began his efforts to broker a deal, the conflict has intensified.

The hot dog statue wore tennis shoes and held a Ukrainian flag in its left hand and an American flag in its right. (The hot dog had hands.)

Standing outside the flagship store of the Ukrainian gas station chain Socar, the statue displayed a sign advertising “Nathan’s Famous” hot dogs in the same green curlicue script that promotes the chain at its original location in Brooklyn’s Coney Island and Nathan’s outlets everywhere.

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, Ivan Pozniak, a 35-year-old airline pilot, walked past the statue and into the store connected to the gas station. He was about to try his first Nathan’s Famous hot dog.

“Overall, it’s delicious,” Mr. Pozniak said after his first bite of the so-called New York hot dog, with mustard, ketchup and sweet pickle relish. “I usually prefer more classic sauces like Tabasco or the standard ketchup and mayonnaise — that’s what I’m used to. This pickle relish surprised me, but in a good way.”

Russia and Ukraine engaged in large-scale dueling air assaults overnight Saturday, launching hundreds of drones in hourslong raids. The attacks came as both sides were carrying out the war’s largest prisoner exchange — a stark reminder that despite ongoing efforts to de-escalate the conflict, a resolution remains far off.

Russia’s attack on Ukraine was particularly significant, involving 250 long-range drones and 14 ballistic missiles, with Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, the main target. Ukraine’s air force said it had intercepted six missiles and nearly all the drones, but at least 15 people in Kyiv were injured as drones and debris from intercepted weapons crashed into apartments, setting them ablaze.

Kyiv residents were jolted awake by the booms of the city’s antiaircraft batteries trying to down incoming missiles and drones. The night sky lit up with bright streaks from climbing air defense missiles and red tracer trails from heavy machine guns. Explosions set off car alarms, adding to the cacophony of gunfire and the buzz of attack drones.

“It was a difficult night for all of Ukraine,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement Saturday morning. “With each such attack, the world becomes more certain that the cause of prolonging the war lies in Moscow,” he added, noting that Russia had repeatedly ignored Ukraine’s offers to enforce a temporary cease-fire.

In the right’s retelling, Mr. Floyd did not die from being deprived of air, and Mr. Chauvin was railroaded by a country that flew into a panic over race and did not consider the facts soberly. To build this case, conservatives have packaged misleading details from court documents, images of burning and looting during the protests, Mr. Floyd’s criminal record and drug use, and legal theories that lawyers say are distorted.

Disputing facts that most people once agreed on has become part of a new political playbook, often employed by right-leaning pundits and politicians. But the killing of George Floyd on May 25, 2020 was not just any news story. For conservatives, it was the catalyst for a kind of liberal mania that, some of them assert, led directly to racial hiring quotas, “woke” curriculums in school and white guilt.

“President Trump’s war on wokeness cannot be considered complete unless he addresses the fundamental injustice that started it all,” Mr. Shapiro said in March, in one of five episodes of his show on the Daily Wire devoted to “The Case for Derek Chauvin.”

Many prominent Trump supporters have joined the defense of Mr. Chauvin, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Charlie Kirk and Christopher Rufo. “America will not be made whole until we receive justice for Derek Chauvin,” Jack Posobiec, the Trump loyalist and conspiracy theorist, told a cheering audience in December, adding, “The truth must come out about what happened with George Floyd. It was a lie and it was always a lie.”

Some suggested the decrease in the number of unarmed people being killed could be a natural outcome in a country where a large percentage of people own guns. It is difficult to evaluate gun ownership in the United States, but polls have shown that more than 40 percent of adults report having a gun in their household.

“In a world in which we are awash in guns, and getting more awash, that’s what’s going to happen,” said Barry Friedman, a professor at New York University’s law school who specializes in policing.

Others were more skeptical.

Justin Nix, an associate professor at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, said he hoped that the data was a reflection of improvements in policing and training, but that he was hesitant to draw any conclusions. That’s in part because of how rare police killings of unarmed people are and the fluctuating number of cases where it is unclear whether the person who was killed had a weapon.

Mr. Nix, whose focus is on criminology and criminal justice, said the difficulty in interpreting the data was indicative of a larger problem, which is that data on police force and killings remains sparse. For example, he noted, there is very little data on police shootings in which a person is not killed. One study estimated that there were roughly 800 of these nonfatal shootings each year.

The Outlook for Policing Oversight

Despite the rise in the overall number of police killings, legislators across the country have rolled back several attempts to reduce police violence.

Organizers of this year’s Cannes Film Festival cast a conservative shadow over the red carpet with the release of a new dress code noting that, “for decency reasons, nudity is prohibited.” The rule was seen as an attempt to tamp down on so-called naked dressing, a trend that in recent years has inspired more people to wear less coverage as a way to get attention.

Whether it stopped people from showing skin was debatable. But it certainly didn’t stop stars from making waves with their appearances. Some, like the actor Jeremy Strong, took Cannes as an opportunity to test color palettes: He wore a range of pastels (purple, green, salmon) that would rival the selection at an Easter egg hunt. Others, like the models Bella Hadid, used the festival to debut new hair (she went blond).

Of all the clothes on display at Cannes, which ends on Saturday, these 15 looks were some of the most memorable for myriad reasons — nakedness mostly not among them.

Isabelle Huppert: Most Brat!

Travelers across the country are feeling anxious and uncertain during a time of upheaval at U.S. airports, and the upcoming Memorial Day weekend — the traditional start of the summer travel season — is shaping up to be especially fraught.

AAA forecasts a record 45.1 million people in the United States will travel at least 50 miles from home during the five days starting Thursday. IHG Hotels & Resorts reports seeing double-digit-percentage increases in holiday weekend travel bookings in areas like the California wine country and Palm Beach, Fla. According to the Airlines Reporting Corporation, which tracks data that covers about two-thirds of global sales, domestic travel is up 4 percent this year, and fewer Americans are planning trips abroad this summer — which could make U.S. destinations particularly crowded. Disruptions related to air traffic control at Newark Liberty International Airport in recent weeks, which could reverberate across the U.S. air travel industry, and recent air crashes have exacerbated the nervousness.

With increased demand on the beleaguered aviation industry, here’s what to know about traveling this holiday weekend.

The Real ID transition has been smooth, so far

The impact of the May 7 Real ID deadline has not prevented most passengers from flying, but could still lead to delays at security checkpoints. The T.S.A. said this month that it planned to conduct additional screening for travelers without the federally compliant state-issued identification “until it is no longer considered a security vulnerability.”

It was less than two hours before United Airlines Flight 110 was scheduled to depart for London from Newark when Nikki Brooks got word that something was wrong.

A team delivering blankets and pillows for the overnight long-haul flight reported damage on a rear plane door around 4 p.m. on Thursday. A photograph showed what appeared to be a scratch that maintenance needed to inspect. So Ms. Brooks, a manager at the airline’s Station Operations Center at Newark Liberty International Airport, delayed the flight.

From a fifth-floor perch with views of Terminal C and the runways, Ms. Brooks and her colleagues make hundreds of decisions a day, about mechanical and medical issues or gate assignments — all to keep United’s operations smooth and ensure planes aren’t delayed.

If they do their jobs right, no one hears about the more than 600 flights a day that United operates at Newark, one of its hubs. Lately, keeping those planes on time has been harder to do.

I grew up going to amusement parks and fairgrounds in Quebec and the United States. Back then, the only thing on my mind was worrying about having my head turned upside down on the rides. My memories are full of the bright lights, fast rides and greasy food stands of those carnivals.

Years later, when I revisited this world as an adult, all I could see was what was happening behind the scenes: workers busy building a wonderful world for children who aren’t their own, and men and women trying to escape a well-ordered life to find freedom and hope in their own way.

The short documentary above was born out of my encounter with Kim Lalonde, who has spent a large part of his life working in carnivals, doing his best to put a smile on strangers’ faces. He also dreams of following other passions, but leaving the close-knit carnival world and his best friend, Billy, would be like losing a family. This tension between freedom, roots, kinship and new possibilities touched me — I wanted to capture this world where people never stop dreaming of somewhere else.

When I first met Nick in 2019, at a dating and self-improvement summit in Miami, it wasn’t immediately obvious why he was paying so much money to pseudo-authority figures from the manosphere. He had looks, cash and some of the easy swagger of London done good.

Nick was over 6ft tall and had nice white teeth, labrador eyes and a healthy quotient of melanin courtesy of the sunbeds at the health club he went to twice a week. Financially, Nick had done well for himself, creating a mobile phone app and selling it to a big company. He’d put some of the proceeds down on a small flat in west London – not bad for someone in his mid-20s with no family money. Nick had even helped his parents buy an apartment in Spain on the Costa Blanca where the family holidayed twice a year, frequenting English bars and greasy spoons with all the other English people. He bought a lot of designer clothes, too (Armani, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Stone Island, Off-White, Hugo Boss). “Important to have the basics sorted,” he’d say, splashing Tom Ford cologne on his neck before a trip to Mayfair.

I was clearly missing something: in particular, any concept of what he thought he was missing. The outward trappings of success were visible, yet internally there was a sense of inadequacy. Nick was not enough, or at least he thought he wasn’t, and somewhere out there was a course that would fix him.

What the various dating and masculinity coaches were selling Nick was a fantasy of control. That if he performed a certain set of actions, he would get a reliable set of results. Unsettling variables would be extracted from the equation. All it would take was somebody with a bit of charisma going off on YouTube, then the credit card would be out; another workshop booked in three weeks’ time. He was a sucker for the promises of spectacular transformations and “guaranteed results for a limited time only and there aren’t many places left so register now while there’s still time”.

I occasionally went out with Nick to the clubs and cocktail lounges of west London. Most of his mates from school were petty criminals, or wide boys from Fulham who were unreliable on a night out. They would drink too much and start talking about doing lines, and it wasn’t even midnight. Nick knew I was writing a book about the manosphere. He also knew that, as a freelancer, I had fewer excuses when it came to going out on a weeknight. I’d get a WhatsApp message in the afternoon asking if I was up for it. I’d reluctantly iron a shirt, put on uncomfortable shoes and tell myself that I might get some copy out of it.

We usually ended up in a club in Mayfair. Nick might eventually approach a woman he was interested in. Occasionally, the two of them would go home together at the end of the night. She’d notice him, glance over a few times coquettishly, and then, after psyching himself up, Nick would glide over and introduce himself. From there it was usually smooth sailing: she’d like him from the off and he hadn’t done anything to ruin the magic. Yet when I’d touch base with Nick the following day, his recollection of the night would usually differ from my own. For him it was all about the techniques he had used in the club: the power stances, the “alpha” tonality of his voice and the dominant frame control.

Nick’s emotional health would cycle through several different iterations. He would discover the latest influencer and seem content for a while. Feelings of self-doubt would recede while the hidden code retained its novelty. He would like to proselytise about it, too. We would meet at a bar or food court and he would wax enthusiastically about the latest stuff he was into. “Women want a leader of men, but society put us inside these boxes and made us passive,” he said while making the shape of a cube with his hands. “That way, we aren’t a threat to the status quo.” Nick would radiate confidence and authority as he let me in on some newly acquired piece of forbidden knowledge. After a month or so of this, the disillusionment would steadily kick in. Nick was a poor disciple, for the same reason he was good with technology. He would always discover some flaw in their inelastic models of the world – some nugget that didn’t quite sit right. Nick would take a few steps back and his search for answers would start over again, the zealous apostle metamorphosing back into the angst-ridden sceptic.

Dating is increasingly depicted as a winner-takes-all world in which a small percentage of men at the very top take the spoils

Nick reckoned he was 15 when his dad tried to have a solemn talk with him about women. “He acts like he knows a bit because the only woman he ever asked out said yes,” Nick, whose parents had been married for 25 years, told me through a smirk. “In his mind he’s got a 100% success rate.” The Talk made Nick cringe still 10 years later. “He said if I liked a girl, then I should buy her flowers, make a gesture and show her how I feel.” I asked Nick if he’d ever tried his dad’s approach. “Once,” he told me – when he was 16. “Nothing really happened. She didn’t take the piss, which was what I was most worried about. But it went nowhere. She ended up getting with another guy who wasn’t doing any romantic stuff. He used to take the piss out of her in class. I thought he was being a dick. But there was another level I wasn’t seeing.”

Nick had been looking for a girlfriend when I had first met him in Miami. He had a whiteboard in his room with a “vision” on it for where he wanted his life to be in six months’ time. He was fully bought into the self-help dogma about building momentum and improving – always improving. He planned to drop down a few percentage points of body fat, listen to more audiobooks (always on 1.5x speed) and find a quality girl to spend time with on weekends: someone to go out to restaurants with or watch films with on a rainy day. When Nick told me about the vision board, his goals sounded achievable and I was tentatively in favour of them. However, a few months later he scrubbed out the third goal and wrote a new one in its place. This one was more ambitious; it also seemed to have been implanted in Nick’s head by someone else. Finding a girlfriend was no longer one of the objectives. Now he wanted a “rotation”: a micro-harem of women who would share him between themselves and never demand exclusivity. “Women would rather share an alpha than get with a beta,” he told me, ventriloquising some red-pill huckster I had definitely heard say the same thing.

The manosphere has long divided the world into rigid and distinct hierarchies. Women are rated on a scale from one to 10. Men apply a similar taxonomy of social rank to themselves and each other. There are alphas and betas; red-pilled and blue-pilled; high-status and low-status. With the advent of social media, the process of stratification intensified. Dating is increasingly depicted as a winner-takes-all world in which a small percentage of men at the very top take the spoils. The rest are surplus men, condemned to a life of onanistic obstinacy.

In one sense the manosphere reflects wider market logic, which continually pushes its tentacles into new areas of life. Instagram launched in 2010; 10 years later it was home to 1.4 billion users. For some of them, life would steadily become a series of monetisable content opportunities. For others, this and similar platforms fostered subjective feelings of pauperisation. Users were more keenly aware of what they didn’t have; who their competition was; and how they were failing to market themselves correctly as consumable brands. At around the same time, dating apps were injecting market logic into the intimate domains of love, sex and romance. The LGBTQ+ app Grindr went online in 2009, followed by Tinder in 2012. Other people were becoming two-dimensional objects, marketed to potential consumers via these digital catalogues of flesh.

In the manosphere, these technological developments helped to spur the emergence of two contrasting – and mutually antagonistic – communities. “Incels”, a shorthand for involuntary celibates, subscribe to an ideology they call the “black pill”. Followers of the black pill accept most tenets of the red pill. Sex and relationships are viewed as rigid and hierarchical. Women, whom they depict as shallow, deceitful and opportunistic, are said to be “programmed” by their biology to sort men into desirable alphas and repulsive betas. Men outside the community are viewed as “blue-pilled” and brainwashed. Intimate relationships take place within a “sexual marketplace” (SMP). “High-value” individuals have a greater sexual market value (SMV: exchange value) than “low-value” individuals.

If the blue pill is synonymous with ignorance and the red pill about understanding the matrix to manipulate it, the black pill is rooted in the decision to relinquish hope altogether. Incels see themselves as the unwanted detritus of successive sexual and social media revolutions. Refusing to compete with the torrent of perfect images, they stew in nihilism and despair, denied access to the main currency of masculinity: women’s bodies.

Nick wasn’t an incel; he was one of the men who saw incels as a cautionary tale – the ultimate destiny of anyone who failed to mould themselves to the dictates of the digitised sexual marketplace. These men subscribed to many of the same reductive theories as the incels. They knew all about “SMVs” and – in common with just about every other faction in the manosphere – they frequently made men and women sound like eBay collectibles. Yet they were status-maxxers. Instead of marinating in resentment on subterranean forums such as 4chan and Reddit, they were spending eye-watering sums of money in the hope of joining the digital sexual elite. And, inevitably, a new generation of masculinity salesmen were on hand, promising to make their dreams come true.

By the summer of 2022, London was getting Nick down. He’d recently attended yet another pick-up bootcamp. The instructor had got the students to do “social pressure drills” in and around Leicester Square. First, he made them pair up and stand on opposite sides of the street in Piccadilly and yell at each other. Then he had them tap a stranger on the shoulder and attempt to start a conversation using gibberish – for example, “Orange peels. I like orange peels.” The exercises were meant to desensitise the students to rejection so that, later on, when they were in the thick of the action in the nightclub, things would seem easy by comparison.

It was the final drill that did it for Nick. The instructor told the men to attach themselves to lamp-posts in one of the city’s busiest thoroughfares. They were then to simulate having sex with it. Nick did what he was told because he was “trusting the process” (another self-help dictum). As was often the case on these programmes, clients would spend a lot of money and then rationalise it by following orders.

Nick located a suitable piece of street furniture and took up the position. He began with a gentle motion of the hips. The instructor was bearing down on the students, ensuring they were pushing through the fear. “Let’s see some enthusiasm, guys,” he bellowed. “Imagine you’ve just pulled a hottie back to yours from the club. Visualise it.” Nick tried closing his eyes to shut out the passing crowds. He started pummelling away until he reached a steady rhythm. He felt himself letting go as the crowds began to dissolve; maybe it didn’t matter what people thought of him.

It was at that moment that a tingling sensation began to radiate upwards from his loins. He snapped back to reality and looked down: his phone was vibrating inside his trouser pocket. The instructor was berating another student who had detached himself from a lamp to swat away some tracksuited teenagers. Nick slipped his phone out surreptitiously and saw the word “Mum” flash on the screen. He had spoken with her already that day but he took the call anyway; he assumed it must be important. She sounded choked up when he answered. It was his grandad. He hadn’t been answering the phone all morning, so one of Nick’s cousins had gone round. He’d had to go in through an upstairs window because their grandad wasn’t answering the door either. Then he found him still lying in bed, propped up by a couple of pillows. He’d died during the night. “It was a lot to take in,” Nick told me.

Men like Andrew Tate showed Nick it was OK to have muscles, a sports car, more than one girlfriend. And you weren’t ‘toxic’

The instructor wasn’t letting up, though. “Fight the fear,” he bellowed as Nick nestled the phone between his shoulder and ear, and listlessly gyrated his hips. “People in the street had completely faded out by that point,” he said. “I wasn’t feeling fear because I wasn’t feeling anything.” His mum was still on the line, fussing about her dad’s affairs that would need sorting. Had his grandad wanted to be buried or cremated? How should he know? He was still half-heartedly going at the lamp-post when the first salty tear ran down his cheek and into his mouth. At that point, “ it was like: what the fuck am I doing with my life?” Nick finally gave up when a drunken woman kicked him between the legs from behind with a bulky heel. The pain took a moment to reach his stomach but when it did, it brought welcome clarity. Nick said goodbye to his mum, wiped his eyes on his sleeve and tottered to the nearest underground station, hunching over to dull the pain.

Talking to Nick, the same names kept coming up: Michael Sartain, who charged students as much as $10,000 to attend his Men of Action course, which he likened to Noah’s Ark – a life vessel designed to rescue them from the rising swamp of involuntary celibacy; Dan “Blitz” Bilzerian, the self-proclaimed “king of Instagram”, widely known in the 2010s for his ostentatious portrayal of bachelorhood; Andrew Tate. There were other influencers, too, whose names I hadn’t heard before. I would look them up and invariably see the same loud and in-your-face wealth – enormous houses, luxury vehicles, yachts, private jets. But the most important prop of all was always the women, half-naked and willing – the more the better.

Nick regarded the Tate brothers, Andrew and Tristan, as high-status men. They hadn’t been arrested for suspected sex trafficking at that point; I just knew Andrew as this obnoxious guy from the internet. For Nick, however, men like him were showing the world that it was OK to have muscles and a sports car and more than one girlfriend. And you weren’t “toxic” or “problematic” for wanting those things. A normal life seemed boring by comparison. Nick agreed with Tate when he said that not every man wanted beans on toast, television at night, a nine-to-five job and a homely wife. Some men had a fire inside them, and Nick believed he was one of them.

There was also the question of expediency and not being left behind. “It does get rubbed in your face more nowadays,” he said one day out of the blue. “You see some guys getting all this attention.” From this, Nick had concluded that women were no longer interested in “average” men. Instead they wanted the best. Not just some women but all women. He was convinced he needed to lay the foundations of a high-status lifestyle. “Social media has ruined it for average guys,” he told me one night while we were at a bar in east London. “Girls see what they’re missing out on. Polygyny is nature’s equilibrium, and we’re going back there because it’s a better proposition for women than being with a beta.” Nick had been watching YouTube, listening to red-pill podcasts. He’d also been reading up on evolutionary psychology, comparing the events that supposedly took place in our ancestral past with the things he was seeing on social media and out at the club. The reality was brutal and shouldn’t be sugar-coated.

Nick liked to point out that 16 million men in the former Mongolian empire were direct descendants of the warrior-ruler Genghis Khan. “This is what happens when hypergamy goes unchecked,” he told me one evening during a catchup, blithely leaving out the raping and pillaging. “Look around you,” Nick said wearily. “High-status men have all the options.” We were getting food at Boxpark in Shoreditch, east London, on a wet and windy January evening. We were sitting at a picnic table. Next to us were some mixed groups of twentysomethings who, like us, were drinking beer out of plastic cups. “You really believe that?” I asked Nick. “On here I mean,” he said, waving his phone in the air. He then laid it on the table and took in the flesh and blood world for a moment. “They aren’t fucking those dudes any more,” he added, pointing to a group of men sitting at an adjacent table. “That girl, she’s probably talking to a high-status guy behind his back, or at least hoping he’ll slide into her DMs. That’s what social media has done; it’s changed expectations.”

In this, Nick seemed to be parroting another red-pill guru, Rollo Tomassi, who has accused social media of “grossly inflating [women’s] egos”; others have described them as being “delusional” about their dating prospects. Of course, the most delusional thing here was the idea that social media was boosting women’s self-esteem. In fact, Instagram has made body-image issues worse for one in three girls, according to internal Meta research leaked to the Wall Street Journal. In one study of teenagers in the UK and the US, more than 40% of Instagram users who said they felt “unattractive” said they started to feel that way after using the app.

I asked Nick if he thought his own sense of reality had been distorted at all by social media. (He admitted to watching internet porn for “at least 10 minutes” on most days.) “Maybe,” he replied before slamming the door firmly shut on that train of thought. “But I reckon I would want those things anyway,” he added. “As men, we aren’t programmed to be with one woman. Our proclivities weren’t created by reason, but by natural selection.”

Nick was ventriloquising one of his favourite gurus again.

On the streets of Gaza City this week, there were two sounds that never ceased, day or night. In the west, the Mediterranean breakers crashed on the rubbish-strewn shoreline. In the east, the shells, missiles and rockets exploded with dull thuds and occasional ear-splitting cracks.

At least 100,000 people have come to Gaza City, once the bustling commercial and cultural hub of the Palestinian territory. All are fleeing the new offensive – dubbed Gideon’s Chariots – recently launched by Israel into the ruined towns and neighbourhoods of northern Gaza.

The blasts that the newly displaced can hear, as they crowd into makeshift shelters and hastily constructed encampments, or simply set up their tents or tarpaulins on the pock-marked pavements, sometimes come during direct clashes between Israeli troops and Hamas, though the militant Islamist organisation remains elusive, often underground.

Much more often, they are the sounds of airstrikes and artillery bombardment which have killed about 750 people and injured 2,000 more across Gaza in the last week, mostly women and children, according to medical officials there.

On Wednesday, Mohammed Abu Nadi moved his family from Jabaliya, a neighbourhood east of Gaza City that has been reduced to ruins in multiple Israeli offensives and raids.

“What happened this week was another escalation … There were relentless bombings everywhere,” the 33-year-old said. “My friend was on his way to get a vehicle to move his family to Gaza City, but when he returned, he found his home reduced to rubble. His wife and children were all killed.

“They were just young children, innocent civilians with no involvement in anything. I was shocked when it happened. I quickly carried my wife and family and left the area heading towards Gaza City.”

Abu Adam Abdul Rabbo, 55, said more than 80 members of his extended family had been killed during the 19-month conflict, which was triggered by a Hamas attack into Israel in which militants killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and abducted 251, of whom 57 remain in Gaza. The ensuing Israeli offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, also mostly civilians, and reduced much of the territory to rubble; smashing roads, health facilities, schools, religious sites, sanitation systems and much else. Israeli officials say they only attack military targets and accuse Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge it denies.

A week ago, Rabbo said he was woken by the sound of a huge blast that had targeted his brother’s house, killing five.

“We struggled to transfer their bodies to hospital as a quadcopter drone was firing bullets everywhere. We managed to bury them in the Jabaliya town cemetery. After that, we decided to leave, fearing for the lives of our remaining children.

“We were able to carry only a few basic items – some clothes and food. My wife was crying bitterly, asking: ‘How will we survive? What can we take with us? How long will we remain displaced?,’” Rabbo said.

This month, food security experts backed by the United Nations said the territory was at critical risk of famine, with cases of malnutrition rising rapidly.

UN warehouses in the territory are empty and most of the free bakeries that many relied on for their daily bread shut down weeks ago – though aid agencies have been able to keep some community kitchens running to produce about 300,000 meals a day. The limited food available to buy is too expensive for almost everybody, with 1kg of tomatoes or onions costing the equivalent of $13.

“Every corner of every street is crowded with people,” said Amjad Shawa, the director of the Gaza NGOs Network who is based in Gaza City. “They are living in rubbish dumps, cesspits. There are flies, mosquitoes. We have no water to deliver, no food, no tents or blankets or tarpaulins, nothing. People are very, very hungry but there is nothing to give them.”

UN officials said on Friday that their clinics and pharmacies were no longer able to offer 40% of the treatments categorised as essential by the World Health Organization. Medics interviewed last week reported seeing many abscesses and skin diseases among patients, as well as acute cases of diarrhoea and respiratory illnesses – in addition to the many injuries from airstrikes.

“We see some children with malnutrition, but everyone complains of being hungry,” said Dr Iain Lennon, a British emergency medicine consultant in Mawasi, southern Gaza. “We often see patients who are tired or dizzy because they just have not eaten enough.”

In recent days, Israel has eased the tight blockade into Gaza imposed in early March, when the first phase of a fragile ceasefire expired. On Friday, 100 trucks entered the territory, but very little aid had been distributed.

Humanitarian officials said a key problem was security. Law and order improved in the territory during the ceasefire from mid-January to March when Hamas-run police were on the streets, but it has collapsed since. Of a convoy of 20 trucks each carrying 20 tonnes of wheat flour for the World Food Programme, only three arrived at their destination on Thursday night after two broke down and 15 were hijacked by looters and driven away.

“You don’t see lines of children with rib cages and spines showing like in Africa,” said one UN official, “but there you have no roads and a population scattered over an area the size of Europe. Here, there is 130,000 tonnes of aid just the other side of the entry points into Gaza, a few kilometres away.”

Few have confidence that a US-backed Israeli scheme to bring in aid due to start next week will improve the situation. The plan involves a small number of distribution hubs in southern of Gaza being run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops who will vet recipients. UN aid workers describe the scheme as dangerous, impractical and possibly unlawful.

To get aid, Palestinians will have to travel up to 25 miles (40km) across rubble-strewn roads during an active conflict, despite an almost total lack of available transport, to retrieve a monthly 20kg food parcel.

“It would be very difficult to go there, and there is no guarantee that you can come back,” Shawa said. “This is an engineered strategy to displace people and start clearing the north of Gaza.”

Israel said the plan was necessary to prevent Hamas seizing and selling aid to fund its operations. Aid officials in Gaza said on Friday there was no evidence of any widespread diversion of aid at any stage of the conflict.

Meanwhile, the vulnerable suffer the most. Six weeks ago the eldest son of Ihab al-Attar, from Beit Lahia, tried to return to the family home to retrieve food and clothes, but he was targeted by a missile and badly injured. There was no warning and no evacuation orders from the Israeli military, Attar, 41, said.

A series of operations saved 21-year-old Mahmoud’s life but left him without much of his intestines and an infected wound. When the new Israeli offensive began 10 days ago, the family were forced to more from their battered but habitable home to a tent on a street in Gaza City. With almost all hospitals in northern Gaza no longer functioning and the remaining few overwhelmed, the family were trying to care for Mahmoud themselves.

“Now Mahmoud’s condition worsens day by day,” Attar said. “The hardest part is watching my son dying before my eyes and being unable to do anything for him. I fear I will lose my son.”

Also in great danger is Yazan, Nadi’s eight-year-old quadraplegic son who, his father said, needed a special diet and care.

“He has become extremely thin and is suffering from severe malnutrition. I took him to the hospital several times, but the doctors told me they can’t do anything for him.”

Few hold out much hope for any relief soon. Negotiations for a new ceasefire have stalled, and aid is likely to take days, even weeks to arrive, in northern Gaza, if at all.

Umm Ammar Jundiyea, 65, who is in Gaza City after fleeing the eastern neighbourhood of Shujaiya, described a “bleak” future.

“The world does not care about what is happening in Gaza, even if we all die,” the mother of eight said. “This world is deceitful and hypocritical. It claims to be civilised and humane, but it only sees with one eye.”

I have been dating my boyfriend (we are both in our 20s) for almost a year. I’m absolutely smitten. He makes me feel a better person, and I believe we are really good together.

Sadly, he doesn’t have a very good relationship with his family. I haven’t really seen this play out because I’ve not seen them together that often, but he’s told me about his childhood and that he discusses his family in his regular therapy sessions.

I, on the other hand, have a really positive relationship with my family. I am aware of how much of a privilege this is, but I am worried I can’t really understand how his childhood affects who he is and how he acts, and that I can’t support or know him properly.

He has mentioned how unusual he finds a family that spends time with each other and interacts positively, which breaks my heart.

I would love to invite my boyfriend to spend more time with my family, but don’t want to pull him away from his own or seem like I’m “showing off” mine. We did a special trip to introduce him to my parents, and on some level, I feel like not doing a similar thing with his parents or siblings means he doesn’t feel as strongly towards me as I do towards him (I’ve only ever seen his parents in passing), which makes me sad. I know this isn’t the case, but it’s hard for me to separate emotion and logic here.

It makes me feel unsure about our future. I don’t know what sort of parent he would make. I don’t know what sort of parent I’d make either, or whether we would even choose to have kids. I know a lot of the time people who have abusive parents make great parents because they know how it felt to have otherwise.

Can you help me get some clarity on how I should think about this?

Well, first: wow for being such an amazing and thoughtful partner. I went to UKCP-accredited psychotherapist Katherine Walker, who is the author of Step Up, a book about blended families. “I would not underestimate the importance of what your relationship means to your partner,” Walker assured. “Having a safe and loving relationship with someone who encourages you to be your best self is the holy grail of what most spend their time searching for, and it sounds like you’ve [both] already found that!”

Walker emphasised that it’s OK to have different experiences of our families: “You won’t be spending most of your time with them, so as long as your relationship itself is strong, everything else is a really lovely bonus. Diversity is vital. If we were all the same we’d never appreciate our privileges [as you do]; neither would we have the opportunity to observe a healthier dynamic and learn to question things when we are/were treated badly.”

If and when you get to talking about children, a good idea might be therapy for both of you, to discuss your expectations

You are right that how we are parented (and I would say how our siblings treated us too) affects us. But we can either choose to emulate that or challenge it and change it (or, what most people do: a bit of both). It sounds as if your boyfriend is already doing that by talking about his family when he wants to and going to therapy, so he’s changing the script. Walker explained that sometimes people are quite blind to how they were brought up and never think about it or discuss it. “When things are kept in the shadows,” she said, “and not worked with, we don’t have the opportunity to grow or learn.”

Your relationship is only a year old. It’s young but sounds extremely promising. If and when you get to talking about children, a good idea might be therapy for both of you, to discuss what your expectations are (if only more people did this!).

You said in your longer letter that you didn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable by asking questions, but both Walker and I think that, while you shouldn’t bombard him, it’s an idea to let him know that he can talk with you if he wants to. “If you can learn to develop a healthy and open communication style now, when your relationship is in its relatively early stages, it will pay dividends as your relationship matures,” she said. “It can also give him the opportunity to say how he feels about spending more time with your family. At the moment you’re projecting how you think he might feel.”

Overall, there’s lots of promise in your relationship – for discussion, connection and a happier future. Try not to worry too much; there’s far more to celebrate.

Benjamin Netanyahu and Vladimir Putin enjoyed a friendly phone chat earlier this month, marking the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat. The Israeli and Russian leaders have much in common. Both claim to be still heroically battling Nazis, in Gaza and Ukraine respectively. This fiction is used to justify the mass murder of civilians, spiralling troop casualties and huge economic and reputational costs. Maybe it helps them sleep at night.

Bibi and Vlad: the world’s most wanted men – and possibly the most despised.

Overseeing the random killing, maiming and traumatising of thousands of children is one of many shared behaviours. These two authoritarian “strongmen” have each plunged their countries into global pariahdom and moral purdah. Conflict keeps them in power. They milk patriotic sentiment to cow domestic opponents and vilify foreign critics as antisemites, terrorist sympathisers or Russophobes. They wage war because they fear peace. Both are on the run from international justice, with warrants issued for their arrest for heinous crimes.

Netanyahu and his far-right cronies deny Palestinians the right to an independent state – the exact same right asserted by Israel’s founders. Likewise, Putin rejects the reality of Ukraine as a sovereign country. Both project messianic, expansionist visions – of a “greater Israel” and a revived Soviet imperium. Underpinning such views is a racially supremacist, ultra-nationalist mindset.

European leaders predict Putin, if unpunished, will eventually turn his guns on them. Netanyahu has already expanded the Gaza war to Lebanon, Yemen and Syria. Latest US intelligence reports suggest he is preparing to attack Iran, hoping to scupper nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran.

And would-be peacemakers, especially the US president, Donald Trump, fail to grasp another visceral similarity: neither actually wants lasting peace. Forever war is their preferred option, their default setting. They depend for their survival on violence. If the fighting stops, they know they face a potentially ruinous reckoning.

What will people say in Rostov-on-Don, Omsk or Nizhny Novgorod when thousands of returning veterans let on what really happened at the front? How long may Putin last when Russia’s elites begin to total up the mind-boggling economic and social cost of his failed gamble? When peace comes, Netanyahu will face elections – and probable defeat. Jail time for alleged bribery and corruption could follow. The international criminal court will demand their surrender. Both could be down and out.

That’s why they fear peace. And that’s why relentless international insistence on ending the wars, backed by increased military and economic aid for Ukraine and tougher sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Israel’s government, is the way to unseat two of the foremost villains of the age. No wonder this pair, whose sometimes rocky relationship goes back two decades, exchanged “warm greetings” on the phone. They need each other now.

Perhaps they discussed ways to beat down critics such as Keir Starmer, as Netanyahu brutally tried to do last week. Netanyahu thinks the appalling 7 October 2023 Hamas atrocities mean he is free to do anything he wants, however illegal and immoral. He’s wrong. Or perhaps he and Putin swapped tips on manipulating, flattering and bamboozling Trump. It’s a game at which both excel.

This Netanyahu-Putin-Trump triumvirate, this mutually reinforcing, cynical political fan-dance, is now the major obstacle to peace on all fronts. The chaotic policymaking that characterised Trump’s first term is reaching new, dangerous levels of incoherence in his second. If the wars are to end and the Netanyahu-Putin era brought to a close, US power and leverage must be fully deployed in close cooperation with Washington’s allies.

Right now, the opposite is happening. Visiting the Gulf, Trump more closely resembled a spivvy travelling salesman than a US president. Personally indifferent to starving Palestinians in Gaza, he is belatedly trying to curb Netanyahu’s embarrassing excesses – and stop him bombing Iran. But that doesn’t mean Trump has seen the light on Palestine. Now his ugly “Gaza riviera” wheeze has flopped, he seems to have lost interest. There’s nothing in it for him.

If the temporary Gaze ceasefire is reinstated, and more hostages released, Trump will claim credit. But the fundamental problem remains: he is aiding and arming a rogue prime minister and a far-right governing clique that, like American neocons after the 9/11 attacks, is exploiting the Hamas atrocities to advance a chauvinist agenda while flouting international law – and going even further than that by threatening genocide.

On Ukraine, it’s no better. Trump torpedoed a joint British-French-German-Polish ultimatum demanding Putin immediately accept a 30-day ceasefire, saying he knew best. But when he spoke to Russia’s president last Monday, he caved. Once again, Putin made a chump of Trump and divided the US and Europe.

Trump’s dawning realisation that he is neither God nor pope, and that the force of his personality is not by itself sufficient to resolve all worldly woes, offers a glimmer of hope for Gaza and Ukraine. In a snit, Trump is threatening to walk away. If only he would! The US must remain engaged on multiple levels. But a Trappist stance of presidential silence would greatly assist the cause of peace.

Like a quack doctor misdiagnosing problems, Trump makes matters worse. Each day, Netanyahu and Putin get away with murder due in large measure to their clueless, narcissistic White House bro. Each day, more children’s lives are devastated.

Trump should stop grandstanding and delegate Gaza and Ukraine peacemaking to experienced US career diplomats, UN envoys, Arab and European mediators, intelligence chiefs and military experts. In short, he should leave it to people who know what they’re doing. As for Netanyahu and Putin, he should wash his hands of both.

In your first memoir, My Favourite People and Me, you picked Kylie Minogue as one of your favourite people – but added that you stopped loving her when I Should Be So Lucky came out. To make this a question: how dare you?

Ah, Kylie. She’s completely adored everywhere she goes, and I adore her as well. I fell for her when she was Charlene in Neighbours – I was a student studying drama in the 80s and the only drama that any of us cared about was Neighbours. Australian girls were the pin-ups for everybody in England.

There was a studio in the UK called London Studios where we filmed QI for years until it closed down. There was a picture outside my dressing room of Kylie Minogue singing to Kermit the Frog. She looked so exquisitely beautiful, and Kermit, of course, is very cute as well. After a wrap party, I’d had a few wines so I tried to get it off the wall to take it home. It was so screwed on that all I did was crack the glass and cut my finger. I was like, “Oh my God, what am I doing?” There was almost certainly CCTV in that corridor. And blood splattered on the picture.

I am very enamoured of Kylie Minogue. Subsequently to the picture incident, I actually ordered a Kylie wristwatch. There is a picture of her on the face of the watch, which presumably is lifesize because she is a very, very small lady.

You are about to tour Australia for the first time in a decade. After all your visits, is there anything you still don’t quite understand about it?

The antipathy towards New Zealand! It’s so extraordinary. The hostility is off the scale. New Zealand’s beauty doesn’t take away from the extraordinary natural beauty of Australia. You’ve got fantastic marsupials. There’s no denying it. Why do you guys hate each other? But it’s the same if you go to Devon and Cornwall. These are two of the most beautiful counties in Britain – and they detest one another! The thing that kills people who live in Cornwall is that you have to go through Devon to get to it.

What is your most controversial pop culture opinion?

Will Ferrell should have won an Oscar for Blades of Glory. They never give it to a comedian, do they? In that film you cannot take your eyes off him. It’s an astonishing performance. There’s one bit where he’s got no shirt on – I love him because, like a normal person, he hasn’t been to the gym. He’s just a regular bloke with three terrible tattoos. He turns around and says to someone, “Checking out my ink?” It just makes me laugh so much. I also think he should have won an Oscar for Elf: “You’re sitting on a throne of lies!”

Where is the weirdest place you’ve been recognised?

There is always a urinal involved. I was at a festival where they had these urinals in the gents where you all face one another – so you’re obscured from the waist down, but you end up looking people in the eye while you’re trying. There is nothing that stops the flow quicker than someone staring you in the face. Anyway, someone started shouting, “Oh, it’s him. It’s him. It’s that bloke. You’re not funny. You’re the one with the lisp on that show.” You know, loads of abuse. I’m standing there thinking, can you all just shut up for five seconds so I can wee? Eventually I left without peeing.

Me and the kids absolutely love The Mandalorian – looking back now, that’s the moment to be a Mandalorian, in your helmet. No one would ever be rude to a Mandalorian. He’d wipe the floor with you, while he’s having a wee.

Do you ever get called Jonathan Creek?

Oh God, yeah. “Jonathaaan!” I’ve also been called Jonathan Ross. Wrong Jonathan – and I’m not even Jonathan! Nowadays people think I’m James May from Top Gear. I get that a lot. I was on a train and I saw a kid coming up from about three carriages away, looking at me the whole way. He stood right in front of me and said, “Oh no, that’s not James May.” And he turned around and went away!

Once, when I was a teenager, someone – very generously – compared me to James Dean. I don’t look like James Dean, obviously, but I liked the comparison! But to go from James Dean to James May is a terrible, crashing descent. No disrespect to James May, but he’s not James Dean. Also, James Dean died in a car crash and James May has been driving like a lunatic for 30 years. Life is unfair.

What is the best piece of advice you have received?

“Enjoy yourself.” It was said to me by a Canadian comedian called Mike Wilmot, who is a gnarled and grizzly old guy and a very funny, quite dark comedian. I was coming back to standup in 2011 after 10 years away. I’d become very recognisable from television and I missed standup, but comedy clubs were sometimes very tricky for me. It upset me, because it’s the thing I love to do the most. So I got some stuff together and went to try some new material at a night in London. I was waiting to go on and I was obviously giving off trepidation and fear, so Mike Wilmot came up to me and said, [gravelly voice] “Hey. Enjoy yourself up there.” Honestly, I remember that before every single gig I do now.

Do you get hecklers?

Not really. I actually try to encourage it because, when you’re touring, you want to find out a little bit about the place you’re in. I remember doing a show in Blackburn in Lancashire. I said, “What’s Blackburn like? What’s the absolute shithole of the area?” And they all went, “Burnley!” They hated Burnley, which is about 20 miles away. So I went, “Is anyone in from Burnley?” And a load of people went, [cheerfully] “Yeah!” The people from Burnley said they refer to Blackburn as just “Bastard” – they won’t even say the name of the town!

I like a bit of interaction with the audience. The best heckle I ever had was when I was younger. I used to wear these lime-green moleskin trousers and someone shouted, “Are you colour blind?” The audience all laughed and it took me a couple of minutes to get them back. If you really want to upset a comedian, heckle them about their appearance.

What has been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity?

I was lucky enough to meet and work with Bob Monkhouse, the famous comedian and TV host. When he met new people, he would put his hand out with a big smile on his face, and he’d say, [reassuringly] “Bob Monkhouse.” Which I think just put people at ease, because everyone knew it was Bob Monkhouse. So I thought, “Oh, that’s really good, I’m going to do that.”

So one time I met Kriss Akabusi, who was this Olympic medallist who has a very effervescent personality – he was popular and had a television career after his hurdling career ended. When I met him, I put out my hand, and I said, [reassuringly] “Alan Davies.” And he said, “Nice to meet you, Dave.”

He had no idea who I was. I’m not Bob Monkhouse. Some people know who I am. Some people think I’m called Jonathan. But Kriss Akabusi had no idea who I was and to this day I cringe about it. Why did I do it? I’d be better off saying, “Bob Monkhouse.” He’s such a nice bloke, Kriss Akabusi, but he thinks I’m called Dave to this day – we never met again.

Are you able to wheel out facts you learned from being on QI?

I only have one fact that has stayed in my brain, because I can’t remember anything. Multiple times on the show I’ve said, “I don’t know how I know this but … ” and they go, “You know this because we did it in series G!!!”

This is the fact: when the Vikings left Scandinavia in their longboats and went looking for land, they took ravens with them. They would release a raven and it would fly incredibly high – and, if it saw land, it would fly towards it. So you follow the raven, right? If it doesn’t see land, it comes back to the boat because they can’t land on water. That’s the only fact I can remember and I’ve been doing QI for 23 years.

What is the strangest thing you’ve done for love?

Katie, my now wife, and I were in Germany. We’d been on a boat on Lake Starnberg, which is south of Munich. Beautiful place, you can see the mountains of Austria and so on. But we couldn’t see anything that day because there was an absolutely terrifying electrical storm. We thought we were all going to die. So we got off the boat at this little place called Tutzing. There was a guy who ran a kiosk on the jetty there and it was really raining, so we’re hiding under his awning and he said [in a German accent] “You want a beer?” So we did. Then he went “You want some snuff?” I’ve never had snuff in my life but I said OK. So he gave me this menthol snuff – it was like chewing gum for the brain! And about two minutes later I proposed to Katie. So the strangest thing I’ve done which resulted in love was snuff. We’ve been married for 18 years – worked out all right.

It was Darren McMullen’s obsession with padel that led him to missing an audition and changing the course of his life. Known for his role as Alex Larden on House Husbands and for presenting shows such as The Voice Australia, he had increasingly been sucked into padel tournaments.

“My agent went crazy: ‘What were you thinking? What’s your bread and butter?’” McMullen says. “I was like, ‘God, you’re right. I should open a padel centre.’”

That was 2023; now he has three sites in Sydney and Canberra, including one in Moore Park with a sauna, ice baths and DJ decks. While Racquet Club does have pickleball courts as well, McMullen is firmly a padel man. “I think it’s the best game ever invented,” he says.

Pickleball may be one of the fastest growing sports in Australia, not least because courts are popping up in breweries. But padel is snapping at its heels. Australia is relatively late to the party, but there are now 14 padel clubs around the country, and the delirium that the sport attracts overseas, in Europe and South America in particular, is feeding the buzz over here. (Incidentally, McMullen advises you don’t poshly pronounce “padel” as “padelle”, since to do so would mark you out as someone who “goes to Barcelona once and refuses to say the name without a lisp”.)

Both padel and pickleball appeal to wannabe or retiring tennis players, since they’re less hard on the body (particularly thanks to the underarm serve) and can be played with a lower skill level, but they also attract a broader demographic because of the sociability of being doubles sports. Pickleball, originally invented as a family game, is played on an open 13.41 x 6.1m court with a plastic ball, while padel is played on a 20m x 10m glass-walled court (for squash-like returns), using a ball that’s more like a tennis ball.

The upstart sports have attracted the attention of celebrity fans, too. Team Padel includes tennis pros from Rafael Nadal to Pat Rafter, who is Padel Australia’s founding ambassador, while Lionel Messi co-owns a padel team and Cristiano Ronaldo owns clubs. Team Pickleball counts Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf (who both have signature pickleball paddles), and Billie Eilish and Coldplay have stopped by Racquet Club for a pickleball playoff.

There’s a sense of tribalism that arises from loyalty to one sport or the other. The Telegraph UK called this jousting “the battle for the new middle class favourite sport”.

“Pickleball’s a fantastic game,” McMullen says generously, “but it’s a game, not a sport.”

So which should we emotionally invest in – is this rivalry just VHS v Beta all over again, with one bound for extinction? The Guardian asked three players with skin in the game.

Which requires more skill?

Rosa Morris is a former tennis player who gave up when a shoulder injury got in the way of her overarm serve. She and a friend were trying to find unusual things to do, which led them to dragon boat racing, axe throwing and then pickleball. She now competes internationally and reached No 1 in Australia for masters. Yes, pickleball can be fun, but as Morris says “I never do anything for fun”.

“The speed of pickleball is incredible,” she says. “The ball comes rocketing at you and you’ve got to change direction very quickly. The rallies you have at the net are called fireflies or hand battles. It’s like ping-pong on steroids.”

Morris isn’t sure about padel. “I’ve watched a bit of it,” she says. “It’s crazy. They can go out of the door and play the ball and it looks like no one can ever win a point; it goes on and on.”

To this attitude, McMullen replies, “I could give my mum, who’s never played a racket sport, a pickleball paddle and she’d be able to have a back and forth.”

No matter how skilled a player is, there’s always an opportunity for injury. Rob Daley is chief operating officer of Game4Padel in Australia, which has clubs expanding across Victoria and an ambassador in Andy Murray. He also plays on the national senior men’s padel team and half-jokes that padel could become our new most dangerous sport in the same way that squash was in the 80s, when middle-aged executives suddenly started exerting themselves.

Morris admits to having “done two hammies” from the fast pivoting that pickleball requires. Geelong-based GP (and occasional pickleball player) Adrian Jury told the Guardian that he had heard radiologists were seeing an epidemic of Achilles ruptures in older players who’d had a few drinks before hitting the court.

Which is more affordable?

Depending on the site and time, Game4Padel charges $50-$80 for an hour of padel and $20 for pickleball, while Racquet Club charges $60-$100 for a hour of padel compared with $30-$50 for pickleball. “When you take into consideration that each padel court costs $100,000, we spend close to $2m fitting out a warehouse, and our rent is close to a million dollars a year, I would say it’s quite reasonable,” McMullen says.

By contrast, Pickleball courts often get marked out on existing volleyball, badminton and indoor soccer courts, making them much cheaper. “The lines get freaking confusing,” says Morris, who prefers to travel 90 minutes to use a $50-an-hour purpose-built court.

Which is likely to make it to the Olympics first?

Game4Padel plans to develop junior programs and high performance programs, to develop the sport’s growth and get a young generation Olympic-ready.

“There’s an arms race to try and get a spot in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics,” Daley says. “Padel’s a fair way in front, but there’s a pretty big checklist to tick off and probably a few things that the governing body is still a bit short on. With pickleball, there’s no single international governing body … and if you haven’t got that, the reality is you’ve got no chance.”

McMullen is frustrated by all the red tape. In part, it’s a lack of enthusiasm from local councils and constituencies – “It’s like we’re asking to put in a fucking nightclub” – but he also cites the ambivalent approach of Tennis Australia, who promote padel, but who also recommend that the integration “not come at the expense of well-utilised tennis facilities or tennis programming”. In other words, tennis clubs aren’t encouraged to surrender a court to accommodate padel.

Rivalry aside, in the end all three players think that interest in one sport will naturally boost interest in the other. And tennis will come around. Eventually.





Russia has launched the largest air raid in three years of the war against Ukraine in a second straight night of massive drone and ballistic missile strikes which saw the capital city, Kyiv, once again the focus of heavy attack.

Across the country at least 12 people were killed, according to officials, including three children in the Kyiv region, and dozens more injured, as officials released the first assessment of casualties and damage on Sunday morning.

Ukrainian officials later confirmed that Russia had launched 298 drones and 69 missiles in multiple waves. Russia’s defence ministry said its air defences had shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the United States to speak out against the Russian attacks.

“The silence of America, the silence of others in the world only encourages Putin,” Ukraine’s president wrote on Telegram. “Every such terrorist Russian strike is reason enough for new sanctions against Russia.”

But he also said he expected officials to press on with a major prisoner swap agreed during talks last week in Istanbul. The swap, in which Russia and Ukraine exchange hundreds more prisoners on Saturday, amounts to a rare moment of cooperation amid otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire.

Russian strikes hit locations across Ukraine on Saturday night into Sunday, from the southern coast and east to the west. Four people were reported dead in the western Khmelnytskyi region, four in the Kyiv region, and one in Mykolaiv in the south.

Sergiy Tyurin, the deputy head of the Khmelnytskyi military administration, said in a Telegram post: “Last night, the Khmelnytskyi region came under hostile Russian fire, which resulted in the destruction of civilian infrastructure … Unfortunately, four people were killed.”

Emergency services said four people had been killed and 16 injured in the Kyiv region, including three children in the “massive night attack”.

Kyiv’a mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said that by 3am on Sunday there were “already 10 injured” in the capital, adding that a student dormitory in Holosiivskyi district had been hit by a drone and one of its outside walls was on fire.

The intensity and frequency of this weekend’s strikes contrasted sharply with Trump’s claim that Vladimir Putin was interested in peace. Trump, who has been talking up his peace efforts, has not yet commented on the weekend’s heavy strikes.

The attacks meant Kyiv Day – celebrated on the last Sunday in May – began with exhausted residents sheltered in bunkers, metro stations and basements.

Odesa, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Konotop, Chernihiv, Ternopil, and Kharkiv were also hit, according to local media reports.

With waves of drones beginning at about midnight on Saturday, accompanied by warnings of ballistic missile launches as the night wore on, a Guardian reporter in Kyiv heard three drones reach the centre of the city, despite action by air defences, and the sound of loud detonations.

Russian authorities reported that a dozen drones flying towards Moscow had been shot down.

The attack on Kyiv began with Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city’s military administration, warning “the night will not be easy” as residents tracked waves of launches on air raid warning apps.

At one point Tkachenko reported more than a dozen Russian drones were flying around the capital.

“Some of the drones over Kyiv and the surrounding area have already been dealt with. But the new ones are still entering the capital,” he posted.

Ukraine and its European allies have sought to push Moscow into signing a 30-day ceasefire as a first step to negotiating an end to the war.

In a blow to their efforts, Trump this week declined to place further sanctions on Moscow for not agreeing to an immediate pause in fighting, as Kyiv had wanted.

Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram: “Without pressure, nothing will change and Russia and its allies will only build up forces for such murders in Western countries.

“Moscow will fight as long as it has the ability to produce weapons.”

08.53 BST At least 12 people killed in heaviest Russian air attack on Ukraine since war started

At least 12 people have been killed and dozens others injured after Russian forces launched the biggest overnight drone and missile attack across Ukraine since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022, officials said.

Three children – aged 8, 12 and 17 years old – were killed in Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv, four people in the Kyiv region were killed, one in Mykolaiv in the south, and four in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to officials and reports.

The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was a particular focus of the drone strikes. The city’s mayor Vitali Klitschko said it was “under attack” but reassured people that the “air defences are operating” as they should.

Ukraine’s air force said on Sunday that Russia attacked the country with 298 drones and 69 missiles overnight, one of the largest aerial attacks since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. It said it downed 45 missiles and 266 drones.

It was “the most massive strike in terms of the number of air attack weapons on the territory of Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022,” Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s air force, told the Associated Press. The overnight strike was the largest attack of the war in terms of weapons fired, although other strikes have killed more people.

Russian air defences, meanwhile, intercepted 110 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 13 over the Moscow and Tver regions, the country’s defence ministry said. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

In Moscow, restrictions were imposed on at least four airports, including the main hub Sheremetyevo, the Russian civilian aviation authority said.

A day earlier, Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 14 ballistic missiles and 250 attack drones on Kyiv, injuring 15 people in one of the biggest assaults on the Ukrainian capital since the beginning of the war more than three years ago.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the attacks indicated Moscow was “prolonging the war … Only additional sanctions against key sectors of the Russian economy will force Moscow to agree to a ceasefire.”

As my colleague Peter Beaumont notes in this story, the air raids came as Russia and Ukraine exchanged hundreds more prisoners on Saturday in a continuing major swap that amounted to a rare moment of cooperation amid otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire.

Russian drones attacked the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and its surrounds early on Sunday, injuring at least 11 people, killing another three people and damaging homes and other buildings, officials said. Officials in the Kyiv region said three people, all children, died. The head of Kyiv city’s military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, said “more than a dozen enemy drones” were flying around the capital early on Sunday. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said the city was “under attack” but “air defences are operating”, telling citizens to stay in shelters.

In all at least nine people died, officials said, as the attacks extended to a string of regional centres, including Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, as well as Mykolaiv in the south and Ternopil in the west. In north-eastern Ukraine, mayor Ihor Terekhov of Kharkiv, the second-biggest city, said drones hit three city districts and damaged a business. Blasts shattered windows in high-rise apartment blocks.

A day earlier, Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 14 ballistic missiles and 250 attack drones on Kyiv, injuring 15 people in one of the biggest assaults on the Ukrainian capital since the beginning of the war more than three years ago. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the attacks indicated Moscow was “prolonging the war … Only additional sanctions against key sectors of the Russian economy will force Moscow to agree to a ceasefire.” Patrick Wintour reports Trump’s refusal to impose the promised “bone-crushing sanctions” over Russia’s rejection of a 30-day ceasefire has left European leaders frustrated and despondent.

The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, spoke of “another night of terror for Ukrainian civilians”, posting on X. “These are not the actions of a country seeking peace,” Lammy said of the Russian strike. Katarina Mathernová, the European Union’s ambassador to Kyiv, described the attack as “horrific”. “If anyone still doubts Russia wants war to continue – read the news.”

In addition, 13 civilians were killed on Friday and overnight into Saturday in Russian attacks in Ukraine’s south, east and north, regional authorities said. Three people died after a Russian ballistic missile targeted port infrastructure in Odesa on the Black Sea, local governor Oleh Kiper reported. Russia later said the strike targeted a cargo ship carrying military equipment.

On Saturday 307 Russian prisoners of war were exchanged for the same number of Ukrainian soldiers on the second day of an extended prisoner swap set to be the largest in the three-year war, according to announcements in Kyiv and Moscow. “Tomorrow we expect more,” Zelenskyy posted. The first part of the large-scale swap involved 270 soldiers and civilians from each side on Friday. More swaps are expected on Sunday to bring the total to 1,000 as agreed in talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul last week.

Russian troops advancing slowly on the eastern front captured two settlements in Donetsk region as well as one in Ukraine’s northern region of Sumy, the Russian defence ministry said on Saturday. The claims could not be confirmed. A Russian defence statement said its forces had captured the village of Stupochky in Donetsk region, east of Kostiantynivka, a town under recent Russian pressure. It also said it had taken control of Otradne, a village farther west along the 1,000-km front and announced the capture of Loknya, a village inside the Russian border in Sumy region. Ukraine acknowledged no such losses.

Gen Keith Kellogg, Donald Trump’s somewhat estranged special envoy on Ukraine, is said by some US diplomats to like to joke that the president did indeed say he would solve the Ukraine crisis in 24 hours, he just never specified which 24 hours.

Dark humour may be all that is left to Europeans as they absorb not just Trump’s refusal to impose the promised “bone-crushing sanctions” over Russia’s rejection of a 30-day ceasefire but also the increasing signs that the administration will wash its hands of Ukraine and instead focus on forging a new economic partnership with Russia.

The mood among the European leaders who heard Trump’s description of his two-hour phone call with Vladimir Putin on Monday – a call that brought a ceasefire no closer – was said to range from despondent to apoplectic. Accounts vary of whether Trump told the European leaders that Putin did not want peace, or simply that Putin thought he was winning. Either way, no sanctions were imposed.

Yet, only 24 hours before, Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president and sometime Trump golf partner, had spoken optimistically of Trump losing patience with Putin’s prevarications and of the possibility that the US Senate would start the process this week of imposing sanctions drawn up by the president’s close ally Lindsey Graham that would penalise countries that buy Russian oil. The seven hours Stubb had spent in March on Trump’s golf team nursing a tournament victory seemed to have been to no avail.

Trump blamed big egos and said the conditions for a deal could only be agreed by the warring parties, “because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of”. He said he still thought “something might happen, and if it doesn’t happen I’ll simply step aside and they’ll have to move on”. He continued: “Once again, this was a European matter and it should have remained a European matter.” The vice-president, JD Vance, simply said: “This is not our war.”

But days before, Kellogg had referred to a 20-point US peace plan starting with a ceasefire that had been shared with the Europeans, completely contradicting Trump’s claim that only the warring parties could have a view on Ukraine’s future.

The episode raises what is now the holy grail of modern diplomacy: how best to influence the US president’s thinking, whether it is over Ukraine, Gaza, Iran or China.

A former US diplomat close to the Ukraine talks urged Europeans to be patient with Trump. “He has gut instincts, those instincts are OK, they are not always wrong, he zigzags, and in the case of Ukraine he is most governed by the tactics he needs to get a ceasefire,” the former diplomat said.

“He is quite aware and not naive in this. He knows the only reason there is not a ceasefire is because Vladimir Putin wants to wage war. So he knows his target is to pull Putin in tactically. He is dangling rewards – the G8, resource deals, lifting sanctions, summit meetings.

“Putin does not want to do this. He has no interest in a ceasefire. He has an interest in eliminating Ukrainian national identity and taking it over. He is playing this out deliberately. He is playing games. He is moving the goalposts almost every day and trying to get everyone to follow him … Trump has continuously made excuses for him, but in the hope he can pull him in.”

The former diplomat said Trump had four basic objectives in Ukraine. “Trump genuinely wants a ceasefire and the killing to stop. He wants reciprocity so he will be able to tell the US taxpayer ‘you are not throwing your money away on Ukraine’. He wants to deter Putin from doing it again, but he wants Europe to take the lead in preventing him attacking again. I find that acceptable.

“The US and Ukraine are more in alignment on the ceasefire than they have been at any point since Trump took office. Trump has said on several occasions he will not throw Ukraine under the bus as an independent state.”

That judgment was confirmed by Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, who told a Senate hearing this week: “Russia wants what they do not currently have and are not entitled to, and Ukraine wants what they cannot regain militarily. And that’s been the crux of the challenge.”

As to the possibility of Trump fulfilling his threat first made in March to hit Russia with punishing sanctions, the Europeans have few options but to wait. They have invested heavily in Graham, a South Carolina Republican senator and someone to whom Stubb talks most days. Graham spoke this week to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.

The former US diplomat said: “Congress cannot force Trump to do anything, but they can be in a position to say we can pass legislation on sanctions to strengthen Trump’s position. The Republicans on the Hill are not portraying this as an alternative to Trump but saying ‘this is how we support his strategy’.”

As such, the 80 senators who support Graham’s bill imposing tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil must also wait for Trump’s green light. Of course, that light may never turn green. Rubio told the Senate foreign relations committee: “If you start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking.”

Moreover, Russian accounts of the two-hour call between Putin and Trump dwell on its warm personal nature and Trump’s praise for Russian sacrifice in the second world war. In return, Putin offered to pen a memorandum on a possible peace accord. No deadlines were agreed.

As a result, Europe’s nightmare – Trump walking away from Ukraine – draws nearer. But there are many ways to walk away. Would he turn off the intelligence, unilaterally lift sanctions on Russia and block even lend-lease agreements that would allow Ukraine to buy US weaponry? In the slow transition to Europe taking the lead in supporting Ukraine, Trump can cooperate or be disruptive. “It can be a managed process or chaotic and fractious,” said Jack Watling, of the defence thinktank Rusi.

The new US ambassador to Nato, Matthew Whitaker, told the Lennart Meri conference in Tallinn – an annual gathering of diplomats and security experts – that after the Nato summit in June the US would lay out plans for troop withdrawal from Europe. Although Whitaker told his audience the withdrawals would be done in an orderly way, not everyone was reassured. Bruno Tertrais, an associate expert at the Institut Montaigne, said: “The words ‘Trump’ and ‘orderly’ in the same sentence do not inspire confidence.”

Some reduction in the 100,000 US troops in Europe is manageable for the continent, given the Biden administration surged roughly 20,000 troops after the Ukraine invasion, but the scale and method of the withdrawal matters.

And it is hard for the Nato summit to agree a new set of capability targets if the scale of US withdrawals will not be known until the autumn. “Nato decisions on capabilities will be made without knowing the future US force posture in Europe,” said Torrey Taussig, of the Atlantic Council. “These decisions about capability targets for meeting Europe’s own defences and a ceasefire force in Ukraine are near-term decisions, yet we do not know what America’s contribution to Europe will look like.”

The sense of frustration is deepened because the European Nato members feel they have agreed a fiscally demanding package on defence spending in time for the Nato summit that addresses all Trump’s complaints about freeloading. Nato states will adopt a new target over the next five to seven years of reaching 3.5% of GDP spent on hard defence and 1.5% on cybersecurity and defence-related infrastructure investment such as roads and bridges to improve troop mobility. (The aim is for the hard defence component to rise annually by 0.2%.)

That might be enough to get Europe over the hump of the Nato summit without Trump exploding but it does not deal with the more fundamental problem of Trump’s benign view of Russia. Stubb argues Europe has to understand Trump’s take on great-power politics and find a way to disabuse him. “What we fail to see in Europe is that the US and its foreign policy doctrine is based on global competition, not Ukraine and Russia. We have to get out of the mindset that the US is only focused on Ukraine. It is not.”

Stubb added: “Trump’s worldview is not far from what we saw in the 19th-century concert of powers – a big power era sometimes of competition and sometimes cooperation. We have to convince the US administration that free trade and common rules are better than transactional deals, and we show we are serious about defence in Europe and that we are security providers and not security consumers.”

If Trump’s vision is broadly one of 19th-century great-power spheres of influence, Stubb argues, then it is necessary to convince Trump that Russia is not a great power and is not worth jettisoning Ukraine and its allies for. “We need to explain that Russia is not any more a big power, economically. It is smaller than Italy, slightly larger than Spain [in terms of its economy],” he said. “Militarily it wanted to deny the independent sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine three years ago. It has advanced less than one percentage point this year, and its interest rate is over 20% and its reserves are out. These are the kind of messages that you have to convey. It is not an easy game, but you just have to keep on engaging the American administration.”

The Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski offers a variation: that the great power of the future is Europe, not Russia. He argues Putin has “woken a giant” in the continent. “He has yet no idea how costly this is going to be. Since President Trump came to power we have already doubled our defence spending,” he said.

Sikorski predicts that by the end of the decade, when Nato countries meet the new spending targets, Europe will dwarf Russia. “We are a $19tn economy. Russia will be a trillion-dollar economy. As Europe, without the US, we are spending two and half times more than Russia on a peace footing than Russia is spending on a war footing. All it takes is to spend the money better, on the basis of learning the lessons from Ukraine and then having the will to gel this into a fighting force. We should be grateful to the US for telling it like it is.”

But that is five years hence, and the immediate issue is whether Europe and Ukraine, with the US on the sidelines, have the means to make Putin reassess the price of victory.

Watling, the defence analyst, argued that Ukraine risks leaving gaps on an extended frontline this summer, but if it can survive then Russia will have exhausted its stocks and be reliant on new production, making its war machine more vulnerable to international supply chains. He said Ukraine’s problem was not manpower but training and ammunition.

Either way, iron has entered the soul of European leaders. They fear Trump is unpersuadable and set on a different course, leaving Europe as the protector of Ukraine.

Kaja Kallas, Europe’s foreign policy chief, said she had been through the five stages of grief over the transatlantic relationship and reached acceptance, but even so she cannot hide the loss.

“The issue of trust is like a vase,” she said. “You broke the vase, you can glue it back together, but it is not the same vase.”

An Israeli airstrike on Gaza hit the home of a doctor, killing nine of her 10 children while she was on duty at her hospital.

Dr Alaa al-Najjar, a paediatric specialist at al-Tahrir hospital within the Nasser medical complex, was treating victims of ongoing Israeli attacks across the Palestinian territory on Friday when she received the bodies of nine of her children killed by a strike in Khan Younis. The eldest of the children was 12.

Nasser hospital reported that one of Najjar’s children and her husband were injured but survived.

Graeme Groom, a British surgeon working in the hospital, told the BBC he had operated on her surviving 11-year-old boy.

Groom said he had been told the father, who is also a doctor, had “no political and no military connections and doesn’t seem to be prominent on social media”.

Footage shared by the director of the Hamas-run health ministry – and verified by the BBC – shows bodies of children being pulled from the rubble of the building near a petrol station in Khan Younis.

The news was confirmed by the hospital in Khan Younis where Najjar works, according to the BBC. Her husband had just returned home after accompanying her to work when the building was struck by Israeli airstrikes.

“Enough! Have mercy on us! We plead to all countries, the international community, the people, Hamas, and all factions to have mercy on us,’’ Youssef al-Najjar, a relative, told Agence France-Presse. “We are exhausted from the displacement and the hunger, enough!”

Mohammed Saqer, the head of nursing at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, told the Guardian: “Dr Alaa al-Najjar watched with her own eyes as the charred bodies of her seven children were pulled from beneath the rubble – while two remain missing – all while she was on duty at Nasser medical complex.

“Harrowing details recounted by Ali al-Najjar paint one of the most heartbreaking tragedies to befall a paediatrician who dedicated her life to saving children, only to have her own motherhood stolen in a moment of fire and deafening silence.”

It was later reported that nine children had died.

Groom, who is volunteering at Nasser hospital, attended to al-Najjar’s surviving child, Adam.



“The last patient on my list today was an 11-year-old boy who seemed much younger as we lifted him on to the operating table,” Groom told the Guardian.

“His injuries were bad enough but the background, I think, was worse. His father was very badly injured but nine of his brothers and sisters were killed.”

“It is unimaginable,” said Groom. “The father [al-Najjar’s husband] is a physician here at Nasser hospital. We’ve asked about him and he has no political or military connections … it is a particularly sad day.”



Dr Victoria Rose, who is volunteering alongside Groom, received a video of the aftermath of the attack.

“The video shows all of the children being pulled out of the fire and they are absolutely charcoaled to a crisp. It is so horrific,” she said.

On Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the Guardian: “Yesterday, an IDF aircraft struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis.

“The Khan Younis area is a dangerous war zone. Before beginning operations there, the IDF evacuated civilians from this area for their own safety. The claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.”

Thee IDF said it had targeted more than 100 sites across the Gaza Strip over the course of the day, as it intensifies its military offensive despite aid agencies warning that the Palestinian population is plunging deeper into malnutrition and famine.

At least 79 people have been killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza in a 24-hour period, leading up to Saturday evening, the territory’s health minister said, adding that the death toll was expected to rise due to ongoing attacks.

On Friday, 30 people and members of the Dardouna family were killed in airstrikes, including very young children. One of the photos – shared by newly awarded Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Mosab Abu Toha – shows the body of a girl less than a year old being pulled from the rubble, still wearing her pyjamas.

Hamas described the airstrike on the home of Najjar as “a horrific massacre”, adding: “This heinous crime clearly expresses the sadistic nature of the occupation, and the level of the deep-rooted spirit of revenge that drives Netanyahu and his gang of murderers and human monsters.”

Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, said the attack represented a “distinguishable sadistic pattern of the new phase of the genocide”.

Israel may start allowing aid groups operating in Gaza to take charge of non-food assistance as pressure mounts to get more aid into the battered territory, according to a letter obtained by the Associated Press.

The letter says food distribution would be left up to a newly established group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is backed by the US and Israel but is not yet up and running. Israel accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid but the United Nations and aid groups deny there is significant diversion.

Israel had blocked food, fuel, medicine and all other supplies from entering Gaza for nearly three months, worsening a humanitarian crisis for 2.3 million Palestinians. Experts have warned of a high risk of famine, and international criticism and outrage over Israel’s offensive has escalated.

Israel is investigating “several cases” involving soldiers who have forced Palestinians to act as human shields in Gaza, sending them into buildings and tunnels to check for bombs and gunmen.

“The use of Palestinians as human shields, or otherwise coercing them to participate in military operations, is strictly prohibited in IDF [Israel Defense Forces] orders,” the Israeli army said in a statement.

“Allegations of conduct that does not comply with these directives and procedures are examined. In several cases, investigations by MPCID [Israeli military police criminal division] were opened following suspicions of involving Palestinians in military missions.”

Earlier on Saturday, the Associated Press reported that several Palestinians and Israeli soldiers had said troops were systematically forcing Palestinians to act as human shields in Gaza . They said the practice had “become ubiquitous during 19 months of war”, AP reported.

Seven Palestinians described being used as shields in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, and two members of Israel‘s military said they had engaged in the practice, which is prohibited by international law.

Rights groups expressed alarm, saying it had become standard procedure and used increasingly in the war.

“These are not isolated accounts; they point to a systemic failure and a horrifying moral collapse,” said Nadav Weiman, the executive director of Breaking the Silence, a whistleblower group of former Israeli soldiers who have collected testimonies about the practice from within the military. “Israel rightly condemns Hamas for using civilians as human shields, but our own soldiers describe doing the very same,” Weiman told AP.

One alleged victim, Abu Hamadan, said he was detained in August after being separated from his family, and soldiers told him he had help with a “special mission”. For 17 days he was forced to help search houses and inspect every hole in the ground for tunnels, he said.

Soldiers stood behind him and, once it was clear, entered the buildings to damage or destroy them, he said.

The two Israeli soldiers who spoke to the AP – and a third who provided testimony to Breaking the Silence – said commanders were aware of the use of human shields and tolerated it, with some giving orders to do so. Some said it was referred to as the “mosquito protocol” and that Palestinians were also referred to as “wasps” and other dehumanising terms.

The soldiers, who said they were no longer serving in Gaza, claimed the practice sped up operations, saved ammunition and spared combat dogs from injury or death.

In October, the Guardian collected testimonies from former Palestinian detainees which were largely consistent with the reporting by AP. The IDF said the investigations were ongoing but provided no more details.

The forcible use of Palestinian detainees to enter houses and tunnels in Gaza first became public in footage broadcast by Al Jazeera television in June and July 2024. An investigation by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz in August gathered testimony from Israeli soldiers who said the Palestinians used as shields were known as “shawish”, a word of Turkish origin meaning “sergeant”. The soldiers suggested it was an institutionalised tactic approved by senior officers.

In 2002, Israel’s high court issued an injunction prohibiting the IDF from using what was known as the “neighbour procedure”, detaining a Palestinian in an area of unrest and ordering the detainee to knock on the doors of their neighbours and oversee the clearance of their houses.

The use of human shields continued, however. In 2010, two IDF staff sergeants were demoted for forcing a nine-year-old Palestinian boy to open a number of bags suspected of containing explosives.

Kamala Harris has criticised Elon Musk, noted “it’s important that we remember the 1930s” and raised concerns about AI when speaking to an audience of 4,500 real estate agents at an industry conference on the Gold Coast.

The former US vice-president, who is visiting Australia for the first time, was the guest of honour at the 2025 Australian Real Estate Conference on Sunday.

She was interviewed for an hour on stage by the real estate industry veteran John McGrath.

Without naming Musk, she cited the Trump administration adviser as an example of a person holding “this misplaced idea that the sign of the strength of a leader is who you beat down”.

“There was someone that is very popular these days, at least in the press, who suggested that it is a sign of the weakness of western civilisations to have empathy,” she said.

“Imagine. No, it’s a sign of strength to have some level of curiosity and concern and care about the wellbeing of others.”

Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, criticised Harris’s Democratic administration and its attitude to immigrants in an interview with the podcaster Joe Rogan released in March.

“The fundamental weakness of western civilisation is empathy, the empathy exploit,” Musk said. “They’re exploiting a bug in western civilisation, which is the empathy response.”

Introduced by McGrath as “one of the most successful women in history” with “her best work ahead of her”, Harris joked: “I am unemployed right now.” She walked on and off the stage to a standing ovation and the strains of Beyoncé’s Halo.

Harris spoke about her upbringing and career. She shared anecdotes from her time as California attorney general negotiating with the JP Morgan Chase chief executive, Jamie Dimon.

She did not mention by name Donald Trump, or JD Vance, or her narrow defeat at November’s US presidential election.

Harris concluded with thinly veiled remarks about the new US administration’s foreign and trade policies.

“I do worry, frankly, about what’s happening right now in the world,” she said.

“I do worry that it is important that we remember history. It’s important that we remember the 1930s. It’s important that we remember that history has taught us that isolation does not equal insulation

“It is important that we understand and remember history, which taught us the interdependence and interconnection between nations.

“History that has taught us the importance of relationships of trust, of the importance of friendships, integrity, honesty.”

She tried to turn personal anecdotes – many taken from her 2019 book – into life lessons for those attending the conference.

Harris said she had often become the first woman in a job – despite discouragement.

“I don’t hear no. I eat no for breakfast. I don’t hear no until maybe the tenth time. I can’t begin to tell you the number of times it has been explicitly or implicitly said to me – it’s not your time. You’re not ready, they’re not ready.

“Don’t you listen. And this is again what I mean about applauding ambition.”

She said Americans distrusted AI because it threatened jobs and risked spreading misinformation.

“It is important to celebrate innovation but, again this may be just the prosecutor in me, one must ask also: are there vulnerable people and are we doing what we can to ensure they’re safe?”

Other speakers at the conference included the British entrepreneur and podcaster Steven Bartlett and the Sydney real estate agent David Walker.

AREC is being held at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre. It runs until Monday. Organisers would not disclose how much speakers were paid.

North Korea has detained three people over an accident that occurred during the launch of a new warship this past week, state media reported early on Sunday.

Pyongyang has said that “a serious accident occurred” at Wednesday’s launch ceremony in the eastern port city of Chongjin for a newly built 5,000-tonne naval destroyer, in which sections of the bottom of the vessel were crushed.

The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, called the mishap a “criminal act caused by absolute carelessness”.

He said the accident damaged the country’s dignity and vowed to punish those found responsible.

Those detained are Kang Jong Chol, the chief engineer at the Chongjin shipyard; Han Kyong Hak, head of the hull construction workshop; and Kim Yong Hak, deputy manager for administrative affairs, the Korean Central news agency (KCNA) reported.

The KCNA report said the three were “responsible for the accident”.

On Friday, KCNA reported that shipyard manager Hong Kil Ho had been summoned by law enforcement.

Kim has ordered the ship to be restored before a ruling party meeting in June. KCNA said the rehabilitation plan was pushing ahead.

South Korea’s military said US and Seoul intelligence authorities assessed that North Korea’s “side-launch attempt” of the ship failed, and the vessel was left listing in the water.

KCNA, however, reported that an “underwater and internal inspection of the warship confirmed that, unlike the initial announcement, there were no holes made at the warship’s bottom”, calling the extent of the damage “not serious”.

Satellite imagery shows the warship, covered in blue tarpaulins, lying on its side, with the stern swung out into the harbour, but the bow remaining on the side slipway, according to the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Based on its size and scale, the South Korean military said the newly built warship is believed to be similarly equipped to the 5,000-tonne destroyer-class vessel Choe Hyon, which North Korea launched last month.

Pyongyang has said the Choe Hyon is equipped with the “most powerful weapons”, and that it would “enter into operation early next year”.

Seoul’s military has said the Choe Hyon could have been developed with Russian help, possibly in exchange for Pyongyang deploying thousands of troops to help Moscow fight Ukraine.

Analysts say the warship involved in Wednesday’s accident may have also been constructed with Russian assistance.

The UK Border Force is in effect under military command, reflecting a wider increase of “hyper-militarisation” in policing, according to a new report on international law enforcement.

A report by the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), timed to coincide with the fifth anniversary of George Floyd’s death, says the 21st century has seen the emergence of paramilitary and “political” policing across Europe, employed at borders, during civil unrest and against public protest.

It cites the Home Office’s 2020 request for Ministry of Defence (MoD) support and the creation within the Border Force of a new post of clandestine Channel threat commander as evidence of the Channel becoming “hyper-militarised”.

Liz Fekete, the director of the IRR and the report’s author, said: “What they have begun at the border does not end at the border.

“First, the government portrays asylum seekers arriving in small boats in an already militarised Channel as a national security threat. The plan to allow French police to push back boats in the Channel can only lead to more injuries, more deaths.

“Second, we know that plastic bullets (still used in Northern Ireland) have already been authorised for use at the Notting Hill carnival and BLM (Black Lives Matter) protests of 2020 and that, since then, BLM protests have been subjected to baton charges, horse charges and pepper spray, and that student occupations for Palestine have been violently suppressed.

“Third, we know that discrete firearms units have been created within crime fighting units (recall the deaths of Mark Duggan and Chris Kaba) and that Jean Charles de Menezes died as a result of the ‘shoot to kill’ approach of Operation Kratos.

“This is why we are saying to the government today that ‘it’s time to take stock’. For this is demonstrably not policing by consent.”

The report says the MoD’s oversight for policing small-boat crossings in the Channel has “effectively [put] elements of the UK Border Force under military command”. In support of this analysis, it also highlights Keir Starmer’s announcement last year that he was giving Border Security Command counter-terrorism powers to deal with people-smuggling, and Drone Watch UK’s written evidence to the House of Commons defence committee in which it said that the Channel had been militarised through the use of military-grade drones.

Another theme of the report, titled Paramilitary Policing Against the People, is the “creeping” growth of “less-lethal weaponry”, which can nevertheless cause life-changing injuries, such as Tasers, which were introduced to policing in England and Wales in 2003, Northern Ireland in 2008 and Scotland in 2018.

The report discusses 69 deaths of migrants, refugees and other racialised people across Europe through the use of such weaponry, mostly asylum seekers from sub-Saharan Africa at the Spanish-Moroccan border. The weaponry is often used in public order situations, it says.

Kojo Kyerewaa, a national organiser for Black Lives Matter UK, said: “Only racism can explain the British state’s fear of Black people on the streets.

“The Met’s 5,900 plastic bullets and 700 officers trained to fire them are not ‘public safety’ tools. They are instruments of racial terror. When we flooded the streets to denounce police brutality, the Home Office aimed those very weapons at us – weapons proven to blind, maim and kill. This is not an oversight. This is their vicious racist designs against us.”

The Met previously said it was “inaccurate and irresponsible to imply the ethnicity of those likely to be involved in an event or protest influences the tactics considered”.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “Britain has a long tradition of operational independence for the police who keep our streets safe. Any use of their powers is an operational decision.”

A group of five Labour MPs is travelling to Taiwan for meetings with government officials for the first time since Labour came to power.

The Labour Friends of Taiwan delegation is due to land in Taipei on Sunday morning and is expected to meet senior government officials, parliamentarians, unions, businesses and civil society groups.

It includes Navendu Mishra, the Labour MP for Stockport, Paula Barker of Liverpool Wavertree, Connor Naismith of Crewe and Nantwich, Gill Furniss of Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, and Tahir Ali of Birmingham Hall Green.

The visit follows a trip by Tsai Ing-Wen, the former president of Taiwan, to the UK weeks after China staged large-scale military drills around Taiwan.

This is the first delegation of Labour MPs to visit Taiwan since Labour entered government last summer. The last trip in March 2024 drew a strong reaction from Beijing. China’s embassy in London called it a “blatant violation of the one-China principle and serious interference in China’s internal affairs” and warned that “any act that undermines China’s interests will be met with forceful responses”.

Mishra, who is the chair of Labour Friends of Taiwan, said the visit was “about more than symbolism. It’s about real, practical partnerships between the UK and Taiwan – two societies that value freedom, fairness and international cooperation. We want to ensure Taiwan has friends in the UK parliament who will speak up when it matters most.”

Last month, China launched large-scale military exercises around Taiwan, accusing its leaders of being “separatists” and “parasites” who were pushing the democratically run island into war. The Foreign Office expressed concern about the drills and said they were “part of a pattern of activity which is increasing tensions and risking dangerous escalation in the Taiwan Strait”.

Taiwan, which has never been ruled by the People’s Republic of China, operates as a sovereign state with its own democratically elected government, military and currency. Its people overwhelmingly oppose the prospect of Chinese rule. Beijing, however, claims Taiwan is Chinese territory and is building capability potentially to seize it by military force.

Speaking at an event in the House of Lords this month, Tsai said that “Taiwan’s insistence and the resolve of its people are crucial deterrents to China’s expansionist ambition”.

“Taiwan will continue contributing to security and democracy in the region and we will deepen our relationships with fellow democracies so that we are all better equipped to overcome challenges and to safeguard our democratic freedom,” she told MPs and peers. Tsai also addressed the University of Cambridge and the London School of Economics during her UK trip.

The Guardian reported last year that Tsai scrapped a plan to visit London during the autumn after the Foreign Office intervened because it coincided with David Lammy’s visit to China.

Andrew Yeh, the executive director of the China Strategic Risks Institute, a thinktank, said: “There is a growing realisation across Westminster and Whitehall that Taiwan matters deeply to the UK: as a trade and investment partner, but also as a vital link in the UK’s critical supply chains – from MRI scanners to advanced weapons systems.

“As the UK faces growing ‘hybrid threats’ from both Russia and China, it has much to learn from Taiwan’s resistance to China’s grey-zone coercion – from countering disinformation campaigns to protecting critical undersea infrastructure.”

An explosion on a boat carrying raw sewage that was docked on the Hudson River in New York City killed a longtime city employee, authorities said.

Another worker on the city-owned Hunts Point vessel was injured and taken to the hospital after the blast about 10.30am Saturday near the North River wastewater treatment plant, according to city deputy assistant chief David Simms of the fire department. A third worker refused medical treatment.

The cause of the explosion was under investigation, but the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, said criminal intent was not suspected. The men on the boat, which takes raw sewage from the city to be treated, were doing work involving a flame or sparks when the explosion occurred, said the US coast guard.

First responders found a 59-year-old man unconscious in the river, New York police said, and he was declared dead at the scene.

The man had been a longtime employee of the city’s environmental protection department. The mayor said he was “a devoted public servant who gave 33 years of service to the New York City, and our hearts go out to his family, friends, and colleagues during this painful time”.

The blast spread raw sewage over the deck of the boat, and firefighters and other first responders had to be decontaminated, Simms said.

Nigel Farage will commit to restoring the winter fuel payment to all pensioners and to scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a report has suggested.

The Reform UK leader is expected to appeal to leftwing voters with announcements in a speech next week, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

The newspaper said Farage would describe Keir Starmer as “one of the most unpatriotic prime ministers in our history and this past week has been evidence of that”, in his first speech since Reform made large gains in the local elections.

Reform UK is riding high after its victories in town halls and the Runcorn and Helsby byelection. Farage, the MP for Clacton, spent last week on holiday while the House of Commons was sitting.

While MPs have left Westminster for recess, he is expected to return to the political arena and say: “The prime minister is out of touch with working people, he doesn’t understand what they want and how they feel about the big issues facing Britain.

“It’s going to be these very same working people that will vote Reform at the next election and kick Labour out of government.”

A Reform source told the newspaper: “We’re against the two-child cap and we’d go further on winter fuel by bringing the payment back for everyone.

“That’s already outflanking Labour.”

This week at prime minister’s questions, Starmer signalled he wanted to restore the winter fuel payment to more pensioners, which is likely to take place at the budget in the autumn.

The payment was previously made to all pensioners, but Labour reduced it to only those receiving pension credit in one of its early acts in government.

Ministers are planning to restore the payment to all but the wealthiest pensioners, the Sunday Times reported.

Civil servants have warned that any changes are very unlikely to be made before the winter due to ageing computer systems, the newspaper said.

Elsewhere, the government’s action plan to tackle child poverty – a document likely to contain proposals to scrap the two-child benefit cap – has been delayed until the autumn.

The plan is likely to be aligned with the budget so it can be fully costed.

The Observer newspaper reported Starmer has privately backed plans to scrap the cap, and made it clear he wants to drive down child poverty.

The government is facing pressure from its own backbenchers to eliminate the cap, all while the threat of a rebellion over a wide-ranging package of welfare reforms looms.

Opinion polls don’t always provide a precise picture of voters’ mood – and the next general election is still four years away. But Labour strategists will doubtless be poring over the data, and it’s not pretty.

Analysis by the Guardian found Labour’s drop in the opinion polls in its first 10 months of power is the largest of any newly elected UK government in 40 years.

Whether it is losing a majority of the seats it contested in the local elections or dropping behind Reform UK in recent polling, there are several warning signs that Labour is facing an increasingly disenchanted public.

Strategists are split on the significance of the poll ratings so early into the term, and whether this will prove to be a permanent blot against Keir Starmer’s government or whether it can bounce back with a few years of gradual improvement.

However, as Labour’s poll ratings slip further – the latest monthly polling average put the party on 23% in May – concerns are growing that time is already running out.

There have only been two other times in the last 40 years when Labour has been so unpopular: in 2009, when Gordon Brown was dealing with the financial crash a year before he was ousted from government, and in 2019, when Jeremy Corbyn was months away from being defeated by Boris Johnson in a landslide election result.

The slip in polling ratings for Labour since the 2024 general election is the worst for any government since 1983, when data from PollBase begins. Labour has dropped from polling at 37.5% in July 2024 to 25.2% in March 2025 – a fall of 12.3 points in just eight months.

Before this, the biggest recorded drop in popularity for a new government was in 1992, when John Major’s Conservatives fell 7.7 points in 10 months.

One glimmer of hope for Starmer is that the Conservatives have failed to capitalise in any meaningful way, gaining just 1.5 points. The main beneficiary of this lack of trust in the two main parties has been Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.

Aside from the party positions in the polls, the ratings for the prime minister himself are also worrying. Starmer’s favourability rating was -31 in May, according to data from Ipsos’s Political Pulse. While that was a slight improvement on February, it was still one of his lowest ratings since becoming prime minister.

Starmer’s drop in favourability across the 10 months since the general election, of 38 points, is similar to that of Boris Johnson in the 10 months to February 2022, at the height of the Partygate scandal. This ultimately led to Johnson having to resign as prime minister, and the Conservatives never really recovered their poll ratings after that.

Ipsos’s director of politics, Keiran Pedley, said: “With up to four years until the next general election, a comeback is certainly possible. However, if Starmer wants to remain in No 10 beyond that election, he will have to persuade the public his government is delivering on key issues like the economy, cost of living and public services and that Labour’s plans for the future, above others, are the right ones for Britain.”

Polling on policy areas also makes for troubling reading for the government. Data from YouGov shows that the public think immigration, the economy and health are the three biggest problems facing the UK in May. Crime, defence and housing are next on the list.

The proportion of the public who think Labour can handle each of these six problems the best has dropped since the party took power. The biggest drops were recorded in health, housing and the economy. Each of these are areas that Starmer identified as ones he wanted his government to improve, but so far the public remain unconvinced.

In July 2024, 29% of people thought Labour would handle the economy best; now that proportion is now just 16%. Labour is now behind both the Conservatives and other parties collectively on the economy. YouGov did not break out support for Reform in these policy areas, but it can be assumed that the recent rise in support for “other” parties can be in part attributable to its rise in support.

Joe Twyman, the founder and director of the public opinion consultancy Deltapoll, said: “If Labour are going to restore their position in the polls, they need to restore trust in these key areas. At the moment they’re not – but at the same time, it could be reasonably argued that no party really is. This is a problem but also an opportunity for them.”

Labour is not winning the blame game on the economy – something that it put a lot of emphasis on in its early days of power with the chancellor Rachel Reeves’ claims of a “£22bn hole” of unfunded commitments for 2024.

Among those who view the economy negatively, Ipsos polling shows that the decisions of Starmer and Reeves are seen as the biggest contributing factor (56%) – more significant than the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

When looking at where Labour’s 2024 voting coalition is at now, we can see why there may be confusion about how to target these voters. Different polling companies have slightly different figures on this, but one thing is clear: the Liberal Democrats and Reform are each claiming about one-tenth of Labour’s 2024 voters. The Greens are polling at about 5-10% among this voting group, and the Conservatives are picking up a nominal amount.

Losing votes in three directions – to the left, the right and to the centre – presents a significant challenge for Labour, in that there is not a clear way to easily target the voters it is losing.

Polling experts agree that the fall in ratings across the board – whether it’s about parties, personalities or policies – is cause for concern.

Prof Sir John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, said: “You need to define what a government is about. Starmer has come into government posing as your friendly neighbourhood plumber. He’s said he’s going to repair broken pipes of the economy, fix the broken heating of the health system. The trouble is, the public wants an architect who will have a vision to build a new building, rather than fixing the old.”

He argued that while Labour is losing voters, there is still hope – if the party can find a way to position itself where it wants to be.

“The world is different – in a world of five-party politics, you might only need 30% to win a general election,” he said. “If the plumber can eventually fix things in three or four years, people might be sufficiently happy that they return. In the meantime, you have Farage voicing people’s discontent.”

A cryptocurrency investor was arraigned in Manhattan criminal court on Saturday morning and charged with kidnapping an Italian man and then beating and torturing him for several weeks, allegedly to extract cryptocurrency passwords.

The 37-year-old crypto investor, John Woeltz, was arrested on Friday after allegedly torturing the man in a swanky home in the upscale Manhattan neighborhood of Soho. The victim reportedly escaped the five-story home on Friday and sought help from the police, who later arrested Woeltz.

According to the New York Times, the police found Polaroid photos inside the home that documented the weeks-long torture.

Woeltz and two accomplices allegedly detained and tortured the 28-year-old man in the home Woeltz had been renting for roughly $30,000 a month. The alleged victim told the police he arrived in the US on 6 May, when he was kidnapped by Woeltz.

The Times reports that Woeltz and another man stole the victim’s devices and passport and demanded he give up his Bitcoin password so they could steal his cryptocurrency. When the victim refused, the weeks-long torture began.

The victim told the police Woeltz and the other man beat him, shocked him, hit him with a gun and pointed it at his head, and dangled him from the top of the five-story home, threatening to kill him. They also cut his leg with a saw, he said, threatened to kill his family and forced him to smoke crack cocaine, the New York Daily News reported.

Reports say that Woeltz refused to speak with the police and retained legal representation immediately. He was arraigned on Saturday on four felony counts, including kidnapping with intent to collect ransom, and pleaded not guilty. Judge Eric Schumacher ordered that he be remanded without bail.

A 24-year-old woman was also arrested on Friday, although she was confronted by a reporter while walking freely on a New York street on Saturday, and the Guardian was unable to find any charges related to her on the Manhattan court’s online criminal case locator.

Many details of the episode remained unclear on Saturday, including how Woeltz and the man knew each other. Woeltz is scheduled to be back in court on Wednesday.

On Friday 26 August 2016, Naweed Ali drove to his first day of work at a delivery company in Birmingham. His next door neighbour and close friend Khobaib Hussain had already been working at Hero Couriers for a month. The name seemed appropriate. There was something heroic about the work they did. Ali and Hussain were hired to drive around the country reuniting airline passengers with lost property. The pay was great, too – £100 a shift, cash in hand. It seemed too good to be true.

So it proved. Hero Couriers was a front for Operation Pesage, an undercover police operation.

When Ali arrived at Hero Couriers in Birmingham at about 7.15am in his Seat Leon, he discovered there were double yellow lines and nowhere to park. His manager Vincent told him he’d park the car for him in the lock-up, as he’d been doing for Hussain. Ali happily handed over his car keys.

Vincent, like the other two men working at Hero Couriers, was an undercover cop using an alias. At 8.45am, MI5 officers arrived to insert an audio bugging device into the car. They found a drawstring JD Sports bag sticking out under the driver’s seat. It contained a “partially constructed” pipe bomb – a section of narrow pipe half full of explosive powder bolted to live shotgun cartridges. And there was more: an unfired 9mm bullet; a magazine attached to an air pistol with tape; and a meat cleaver with the word “kafir” (unbeliever) scratched across it.

A year later, in August 2017, four men, including Ali and Hussain, were jailed for life at the Old Bailey for plotting a terrorist attack. The judge, Mr Justice Globe, said he was satisfied it was only because of the work of undercover police and the security services that a terrorist attack “involving a considerable loss of life” had been stopped.

After the verdict, the renowned lawyer Gareth Peirce, who represented Ali and Hussain, did something she’d never done before. She issued a public statement questioning the jury. “We register our unqualified respect for the system we have of trial by jury in this country,” she said. “But jurors can on occasion get things wrong.”

Peirce is famous for successfully fighting miscarriage of justice cases, representing Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four, and also the Birmingham Six, who had their terrorism convictions overturned in 1989 and 1991 respectively. She was appalled by the verdict in this case, saying it reminded her of the 1970s, when innocent Irish people were being framed for terrorism offences – only now it was Muslims. That’s when she started referring to the men as the Birmingham Four, a deliberate echo of the previous wrongful convictions.

The trip to Pakistan and the courier job

It all started six years earlier, in August 2011. That was when Hussain and Ali first got into trouble. After being radicalised by local Islamists in Birmingham, they decided to join a military training camp in Pakistan. Hussain was a 19-year-old law student; Ali a stuttering 23-year-old who had been on the special educational needs register at school. As soon as the boys arrived in Pakistan, they panicked. Their parents rang to ask where they were. They told them everything and said they wanted to come home. Their parents told them not to do anything stupid and arranged flights for them. Three days later, they were back in Birmingham. They seemed to have got away with it.

Three months later, the police raided their homes and they were arrested. Mariam, the oldest of Hussain’s four sisters, says it was the most terrifying day of her life. “It was horrifying. We were so young, and we’d not got a criminal record, but we were all treated like criminals. It took a massive toll on us.” Hussain and Ali pleaded guilty to preparing for terrorist acts and were sentenced to 40 months in prison. The judge, Mr Justice Henriques, acknowledged the pair, “took the decision not to proceed with terror training and … realised what a shocking mistake you had made”.

The two men were released in 2015. Mariam says Hussain was determined to rebuild his life, but it soon became clear what a struggle this would be. His conviction meant he couldn’t continue his law degree at the University of Wolverhampton. His bank account was closed. When prospective employers found out about his conviction, they wanted nothing to do with him. “You can’t live a normal civilian life,” Mariam says. “Every door was closing.”

So when Hero Couriers got in touch, he couldn’t believe his luck. Hussain had put his CV online, saying he was looking for work and had a clean driving licence. For the first month, everything appeared to go well. But his sister’s car, which he drove to work, had been bugged. After four weeks, the police team appeared to get impatient. They were convinced Hussain was up to no good, but he had given nothing away.

That is when Ali was invited to work for them, too. Remarkably, on his very first day the pipe bomb and weapons were discovered in his car. The two men were arrested and held in custody. Police believed they were in this together. After all, both men had travelled to the training camp in 2011 and been convicted.

On the same day, two more men were arrested in Stoke. Mohibur Rahman had met Ali and Hussain in prison. Rahman had also been convicted of a terror offence in 2012 after pleading guilty to the possession of an al-Qaida publication with terrorist content. The fourth man, Tahir Aziz, had only recently got to know Rahman. A large samurai-style sword was found by the side of the driver’s seat of his car. Police captured an image of the four men walking in a park five days before they were charged.

Operation Pesage was created on a hunch, that Khobaib Hussain and Naweed Ali were a threat to public safety, having already been convicted of a terror offence. The other two, Rahman and Aziz, were identified by the police later as co-conspirators. If the men were rightfully convicted, Operation Pesage may have saved many lives. If they were wrongfully convicted, there may well be police officers who still feel it saved lives because Hussain and Ali had travelled to a training camp in Pakistan. But there was no suggestion in 2011 that the two men ever wanted to attack a British target. They say their dream was to help overthrow the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, because, as Hussain put it: “My view was, and is, that Assad has committed genocide by dropping chemical weapons on the population.”

The trial began in March 2017 and lasted four and a half months. The jury was told about Hussain, Ali and Rahman’s previous terror convictions. The undercover officer Vincent was the main prosecution witness, giving evidence over 15 days behind a screen, including 12 days of cross-examination. The jury was introduced to the concept of “mindset evidence” – evidence based on the defendants’ state of mind, mainly derived from what was found on their devices. They heard how Ali, Hussain and Rahman often communicated with a larger group of about 30 people through the encrypted Telegram app. The prosecution showed that they shared content about violence across the Muslim world and hatred towards the west, praising men who had laid down their lives for Allah on foreign battlefields. It argued that this reflected a terrorist mindset, but the men said they bore no hostility to the west.

The Three Musketeers and Telegram

On 11 August, 15 days before the JD Sports bag was found in Ali’s car, Hussain messaged him and said: “Make new group… me u n Mohib only.” The encrypted Telegram chat was called The Three Musketeers Group, represented by a cartoon of the characters from the 1993 Disney film. They spoke to each other about visions of heaven, how guilty they felt at having done so little while others made real sacrifices. Days before their arrest, Ali and Hussain made an overnight trip to Rahman’s home in Stoke. He messaged to tell them not to bring their phones, but to use pay-as-you-go handsets he had bought on eBay for the three of them. By now, the prosecution argued, the Musketeers were set on wreaking terrible damage.

Much of the mindset evidence hinged on phone messages sent the night before they were arrested. The men chatted by text about a National Geographic documentary called The Liquid Bomb Plot, about the surveillance operation that prevented a mass transatlantic terror attack in 2006. Rahman posted a link to the film; Ali’s browsing history showed he was searching “liquid bomb plot”. Ali posted to the group: “May Allah make it easy for us.” Rahman told his friends, “I feel so guilty. Look how weak I’ve become. I can’t even make a sacrifice as little as my PS4 [games console].” Hussain texted: “What are we doing, akhi [my brother]? Sitting here, working, and that’s it.” He added. “Nothing happening – we just talk. We gotta do something.” The prosecution argued that Tahir Aziz was brought into the plot right at the end by Rahman.

There was no talk of a plot. Rather than being men of action, they appeared to be men of inaction

But the defence argued that the prosecution had joined unconnected dots to create a fake narrative. They said there was no evidence that they would go on to do something. Or what that something could have been. There was no talk of a plot. No mention of bombs, guns or gunpowder. Rather than being men of action, they appeared to be men of inaction. In fact, many of the messages they sent each other suggested apathy and uselessness, and a comic self-awareness about it – they couldn’t even sacrifice their games consul for Allah, while others sacrificed their lives. They even joked about their inadequacy, comparing Ali with one of the useless characters from the satirical film Four Lions.

At the Old Bailey, the undercover police gave evidence behind screens. They described how the fake courier group was set up, how they bugged Hussain’s car, how MI5 arrived just in time to find the deadly bag of explosives and weapons in Ali’s car.

The undercover officers insisted they had not been in touch with each other throughout the trial. But the prosecution was forced to disclose an astonishing trail of communication. The police initially insisted phone messages had been deleted. After the defence said they had access to experts who could recover them, the prosecution produced more than 1,000 “deleted” texts between Vincent, his fellow undercover officers Andy and Haji and their unit, going back to Hussain’s recruitment a month before the raid and continuing through the trial. Vincent texted his boss during the lunch break on the first day he was being cross-examined, but he insisted it was about a personal matter and not the evidence. Vincent and Andy also met at a service station and layby during the trial. The defence said that officers from the unit perjured themselves and fabricated evidence in court, alleging that Vincent had planted the incriminating evidence in Ali’s car. In his summing up, Justice Globe said: “Vincent said that he had an unblemished career in law enforcement. He said he had never been investigated, disciplined or prosecuted for any criminal offence in his career. He took exception to the allegation that he had committed the criminal offences of planting evidence, concocting evidence and committing perjury.”

The police texts and DNA evidence

The officers were old-timers working for the Counter Terrorism Unit of West Midlands Police, whose Serious Crime Squad had been disbanded in 1989 after a series of set-ups, cover-ups and forced confessions. The exchanges are brazen. Before giving evidence, Vincent texted his boss to say: “I’m even more determined to put in an Oscar performance when I get in that box.” In another message, he writes: “We are getting older … but not too old to twirl them and put them away for a long time,” signing off with a winking emoji.

Vincent texts his fellow undercover officer Andy, who is about to retire, and says he hopes his leaving card gives him a laugh. Andy replies: “Not as much as reading your statement earlier!!! Joke joke joke …” In court, Stephen Kamlish KC, defending Ali, read out Vincent’s “farewell” text to Andy, in which he mentioned how much he was going to miss him as a colleague: “So you wanker … U leave me with a load of fucking wet wiped nob heads who don’t know how to put a job together wipe arses or cover tracks … Wanker … Miss you.”

From the recovered messages, it appears Vincent has psychic powers. A month before the MI5 findings, he predicts something pertinent will be found in a car. Then, just before the MI5 officers arrive, he tells his boss “they will look and photograph anything”, even though there is no reason to anticipate finding anything. At 8.19am that day, he tells Haji, who is away from the depot, that there “has been a development” and he shouldn’t return immediately – but the MI5 officers hadn’t even arrived by then, never mind made their discovery.

A major difficulty for the prosecution case appeared to be connecting the bag to the other three defendants. The police had suggested it was the same JD Sports bag Hussain had regularly taken to work, but it turned out his bag was black and white and this one was coloured. The prosecution had also hoped to show the jury evidence that Hussain’s DNA was on the weaponry in the bag. But this evidence was initially ruled out. Three months into the trial, a new ruling allowed the evidence to be put forward, and now the jury saw why it was so controversial.

Among the messages that had been deleted by the police officers was an elliptical one from Vincent sent a month after the JD Sports bag had been found, saying: “It’s a sticky tape story – you were right.” It appeared to be a reference to sticky tape that was found binding the magazine to the gun, but its meaning was opaque. However, when the prosecution finally presented their DNA evidence, another reading became clear. Hussain’s DNA was found on the adhesive side of the sticky tape. But so, surprisingly, was that of his sister, Aisha, who owned the car he drove to work. In fact, most of the DNA evidence belonged to Aisha, who was never charged. The defence said there was a simple reason for this – that Hussain had been framed. It suggested that the DNA had been obtained by pressing the adhesive side of the tape to the steering wheel of the car owned by Aisha and driven by Hussain or to tissues (later found in the incriminating bag) from the glove compartment.

The defence waited for the case to be thrown out. But it wasn’t.

What nobody could have anticipated was the febrile atmosphere in the country and in court. During the 2017 trial, four terrorist attacks occurred in England: five people were killed on Westminster Bridge on 22 March, the day the trial started; 22 people were killed and more than 200 injured in the Manchester Arena bombing on 22 May; eight people were killed on London Bridge on 3 June; and one person was killed and 12 others injured in Finsbury Park on 19 June. All but the final crime were committed by Muslims.

The judge warned the jury to ignore what was happening in the outside world, but this was easier said than done. One day a jury member turned up late. She told the judge she had seen a man reading the Qur’an on her train into court, and feared he was a terrorist, so she got off and waited for the next train.

At times, the trial resembled a farce. In July, a jury member was discharged after asking the court usher on more than one occasion to find out whether one of the police officers (who wasn’t undercover) was single, after another juror told her she found him attractive. The juror who had made it clear she was interested in the officer was not discharged, even though the defence argued this undermined the impartiality of the jury and that the entire jury should be discharged. Justice Globe said: “I have had to ask myself if it is so important that I should not allow you as a group to continue considering this case.” He did allow them to continue.

Everything about the case was mired in controversy. Barristers for the defence, Kamlish and Rajiv Menon KC, defending Hussain, alleged that Justice Globe’s summing up of Vincent’s evidence was unfair. Menon told the judge: “In our submission, this deadly combination of bias, distortion and omission in this case crosses the line into what is impermissible comment on the evidence.” Justice Globe responded: “I reject all defence propositions. I dismiss the applications to discharge the jury or to alter the summing up in relation to Vincent’s evidence.”

On 2 August 2017, the jury returned a guilty verdict, and all four men were given life sentences – Ali, Hussain and Rahman a minimum of 20 years in prison, Aziz a minimum of 15 years. Justice Globe said the men were gripped by a “long-standing, radical, violent ideology”. In his sentencing remarks, he said: “But for the intervention of the counter-terrorism unit of West Midlands police and the security services,” he believed there would have been, “terrorist acts in this country using at the very least the explosives and/or one or more bladed weapons.”

The parallels with the Birmingham Six

At the top of a terraced building in Camden town is the office of Gareth Peirce. On the shelves are numerous files documenting many of the great miscarriages of justice and state scandals of the past half century – the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six; Orgreave miners beaten by south Yorkshire police; Jean Charles de Menezes killed by the Metropolitan police; Moazzam Begg, who was detained in Guantánamo Bay.

She looks remarkably unchanged from how she appeared almost 36 years ago, when the Guildford Four were acquitted (Peirce was played by Emma Thompson in the 1993 film, In the Name of the Father). Same sea-blue eyes, bobbed hair, long black dress and boots. And the same grasp of detail.

For Peirce, this case is personal. In many of her other battles, she became involved post-conviction to clear up the mess. With the Birmingham Four, she was there from the start. “This was our trial. It was on our watch. It’s our continuing responsibility, and they shouldn’t have been convicted.”

Peirce says she realised she was dealing with a familiar pattern of behaviour when she discovered the officers had been using notebooks and had handwritten their notes. One text reveals that a week after the arrests, Vincent’s boss texted him to say: “We have agreed … that you will write your pocketbook for Pesage, not type, hope that helps.” This was years after West Midlands police had computerised their notes. Kamlish pointed out in court that Vincent and Andy were the only two undercover officers in the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit to have used them since January 2015.

She’d seen this before, when the same police force investigated the Birmingham Six in the 1970s. “I said: ‘I know this!’” She raps her fingers on the desk. “I’m saying to our team: ‘Look at this, look at this, we’ve seen it before.’ The West Midlands Serious Crime Squad used notebooks to record alleged contemporaneous interviews and what led to their downfall was the elementary concept of, if you write something and rip out that page, there’s an indent of what you originally wrote.” She rips out an imaginary page. “That’s what ended the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four in the end.” The final page of Vincent’s notebook was missing. “He was told, ‘It’s OK to write up your notebook now a week later’, but his evidence is that his notebook had been created day by day as a log. Yet it was all in the same ink, continuous. It was complete nonsense. And then he got the date wrong. So he had one entry the day before it actually happened!’’

Mariam listens as Peirce talks. I ask Mariam why Hussain and Ali went out to Pakistan in the first place. “There was a lot of unrest in the Muslim community about Syria,” she says, “similar to what we’ve just experienced with Palestine. If you’re practising and you’re from the religion of Islam, it doesn’t matter if you’re not blood related, you’re cast as one nation, and you feel that empathy for one another. But when that trial concluded, the judge said these were young men who made the wrong decision and were influenced by older people.”

She says the trouble is that so many people seem to believe that, even if the police operation was a set-up, it’s acceptable, because her brother and Ali had gone out to Pakistan in the first place. “Everyone makes mistakes, everyone’s human. They were really young at the time. It feels like double standards – Muslims aren’t given a second chance.”

Did they get to the training camp? “They got to the first stop and then one of them rang home, and they fell apart,” Peirce says. “The grandfather of one of them had to bring them back because they were so frightened and had got themselves in such a mess.”

Peirce seems fond of the men she’s representing, but she doesn’t mince her words about them. “There was a pecking order in the Pakistan trial because there were older men who were trying to get involved in something more serious [three of the men were given life sentences for plotting suicide-bomb attacks] and then some were trying to siphon off money that had been raised for good causes, and then right at the bottom you had these chumps!”

I ask Mariam about the evidence that the four men were planning a terrorist attack in 2016. She insists it’s nonsense. Take the Telegram app. “I’ve got Telegram. It’s a social app like WhatsApp. And in terms of content that’s shared in the joint app, it’s content that’s shared quite widely.” What she means is that you’d find many orthodox Muslim men saying similar things about feeling bad that they’re not supporting fellow Muslims abroad.

At the trial, lyrics were quoted from nasheeds (songs focusing on Islamic values) that the men were listening to in a similar way that drill music has been used in the prosecution of young black men in Britain. “Khobaib and Naweed didn’t even speak Arabic,” Mariam says. “They didn’t understand what they were listening to.”

The unlikely couple

Naweed Ali declined to give evidence, citing his stutter and lack of confidence. This proved disastrous. After all, the case began with him. The bag was found in his car. It meant he never challenged the charges against him, first-hand. Much of the mindset evidence could be accounted for relatively simply, but the “liquid bomb trial” references proved difficult, particularly as Ali didn’t take to the stand to say why he had been searching for it. Later in the trial, Hussain explained that on the night before their arrest the three men had been chatting about how they had watched The Liquid Bomb Plot while they were in prison. He said Rahman wanted to watch the film again because he had met some of the plotters in prison. Rahman’s reference to feeling guilty, Hussain said, was because he felt he should be financially helping prisoners he had been jailed with and their families more than he was. When Rahman gave evidence, he provided a similar account.

As for saying, “We’ve got to do something … just nothing really happening”, Hussain insisted that was nothing to do with any plot, it was about the general rut the three of them were in – their failure to help other prisoners and their families financially as they had pledged to; their lack of marriage prospects; their failure to find fulfilling jobs. Although he was pleased to be doing shifts for Hero Couriers, it was hardly the law career he’d anticipated. “I didn’t feel I was progressing … I wasn’t able to move on like others in my family,” he told the court.

Mariam says Hussain and Ali have been monstered by the media, and the reality couldn’t be more different. She describes them as an unlikely but lovable odd couple – Hussain, smart and academic; Ali, older and so unsure of himself. “I think what connected them is they’re very simple souls.” She talks about the innocence of Ali – the way he dressed, she says, is almost a metaphor. “Naweed wears Islamic dress – a thawb. You can’t hide anything in a thawb. Everything would just stick out. For me, that’s a reflection of his personality. He is so pure.” But that’s not how the jury saw it.

Lawyer Matt Foot says he will never forget the day he was called out to represent Hussain and Ali after they were arrested. Not only did Hussain and Ali know nothing about the offences they were alleged to have committed, he says, nor did the police officers interviewing them. “It’s the scariest situation I’ve ever been in. It became apparent that the police who were interviewing did not know the provenance of the key exhibits that were being put to Naweed and Khobaib, which formed the basis of the whole allegation.”

Back then, Foot, co-director of miscarriage of justice charity Appeal, was working for the law firm Birnberg Peirce. For two weeks, Hussain and Ali were interrogated by the police. Foot had previously represented them when they were charged after travelling to Pakistan. This time though, he says, they didn’t have a clue why they had been arrested. “I saw their reaction independently of each other and that helped to confirm it. It was like something out of The Trial. Completely Kafkaesque.” He remembers them being shown a photo of the meat cleaver with the word “kafir” scratched into it. “I asked the officers who found this and when, and there was no answer.”

At that point neither he nor Hussain and Ali had been told Hero Couriers was a fake company. “I went to check out the place, and there was nothing there,” Foot says. “There’s no company. I’m asking people who work in the street have they seen anything and none of them want to get involved. It’s like: what is going on here?”

The samurai sword

On Friday 26 August 2016, Tahir Aziz had just finished his shift at Primark as a retail assistant and collected his children from school. Aziz’s life was largely divided between work, his kids and the mosque. But the mosque was relatively new to his life. He had spent much of his life as a secular Muslim, and had two children he adored with his non-Muslim wife. It was only since they had separated that he had found comfort in religion.

The children split their time between their mother and Aziz, who lived with his parents. He tried to work around them. So he’d end his shift at Primark in time to pick them up from school, then in the evening he worked as a delivery driver for a local takeaway.

On this particular evening, he stopped off at the petrol station to fuel up. As he stepped out on to the forecourt, he was pinned against the wall by police and arrested under the Terrorism Act. “He didn’t know what was happening,” his sister Nazreen tells me. “He said: ‘I haven’t done anything.’ We didn’t see him until he was in court months later. He was taken straight to Belmarsh. It was so shocking.”

We are talking by video link. Nazreen, who lives in Stoke, starts crying. She still hasn’t recovered from the shock. Nor has her family. “Dad was a kidney patient. His kidneys were functioning at about 40% and when my brother was arrested they dropped significantly. He got to a stage where 5% of his kidneys were working.” She tries to speak, but no words come out. Her father died in July 2018. “It was too much for my dad. Tahir was the son my dad relied on. He used to take him to hospital, look after him, and give him money towards the running of the house.”

Aziz was the second eldest of seven children, with four sisters and two brothers. Nazreen, the oldest sibling, a former phlebotomy supervisor who has retrained as a lawyer, says all three boys struggled at school in an Islamophobic environment. They were provoked, got into trouble, and one by one they were expelled before their GCSEs. After Aziz was kicked out of school, Nazreen says he started hanging out with two men who were a bad influence. All three were sentenced to five years in prison for selling drugs. He was only 19 or 20 when he was convicted. When he was released, he settled down to life as a hard-working father and didn’t get in trouble again until that moment on the forecourt in 2016.

Aziz, who was 38 when convicted, is another puzzle in the story of the Birmingham Four. He had only got to know Rahman in the months before his arrest and had only just met Hussain and Ali. Even the prosecution struggled to explain his involvement. He was clearly not one of the “Three Musketeers”. Unlike the other three, he was not under surveillance. The prosecution argued that although he was a latecomer, he was a co-conspirator and that the sword found in his car pointed to his guilt. Aziz said it was an ornamental Japanese sword he had bought from a sports shop as a deterrent to would-be attackers he encountered while delivering takeaways.

The prosecution pointed out Aziz had downloaded extremist material, including the al-Qaida English language magazine Inspire, which featured an article on how to make a bomb. Aziz said he had deleted it as soon as he had seen what it contained. Kamlish told the jury: “You may despise the things they were looking at online, but it does not mean they were plotting to kill.”

Although the jury was ordered to ignore the political climate, Nazreen believes it was impossible. Her brother and the other defendants, “were surrounded by these incidents and they were facing a terrorist trial. Even though the judge said not to take any of the matters happening outside into consideration, you can’t stop a human mind from believing that. It’s human nature to think: if we release these men, maybe they will attack.”

When she saw her brother in court, she couldn’t believe how different he looked. “He had always shaved his head and face or had a short beard. Now his hair and beard were long. They made him look like a terrorist by not allowing him to access a barber to have his beard or hair cut.” Had he wanted to cut his hair? “Yes, he did want to, and he wasn’t allowed,” she claims. “They wanted to show the jury, this is a person we have alleged is a terrorist and look at him.”

In court, Hussain described Rahman as “paranoid”. Perhaps it’s not surprising he was paranoid. Rahman told the court that, since 2015, two MI5 officers called “Rob” and “Greg” had made a number of attempts to recruit him as an informant. Rahman said Rob told him he was interested in Ali and Hussain and handed him £200 in cash as an inducement to work for them. (Ali had also been approached, separately, without success.) Rahman told the court that he feared for his life from MI5, and this was why he had sent Ali and Hussain new phones and told them not to use their regular phones in each other’s company.

The MI5 officers and the Court of Appeal

People who claim to have been unfairly convicted are granted an automatic right to apply for permission to appeal, and usually have to do so within 28 days of their conviction. In November 2018, the Birmingham Four’s appeal (founded on the judge’s refusal to discharge the jury or lift the anonymity order on the undercover officers, and his summing up of Vincent’s evidence) was rejected by the Court of Appeal.

In its judgment, Lord Justice Holroyde said: “We have considered whether anything put before us casts doubt on the safety of the convictions. We are satisfied that there is nothing that does so. The jury by their verdicts plainly rejected that the evidence had been planted. Having done so there was ample circumstantial evidence against each of the accused to support the convictions.” Now the Birmingham Four had to look to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) if they wanted to challenge their guilty verdict.

The CCRC was formed in 1997 after a series of high-profile miscarriages of justice in the 1970s and 1980s, including the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six. It was given new statutory powers to investigate alleged wrongful convictions and refer them back to the Court of Appeal when there were strong grounds.

Miscarriages of justice had previously been dealt with by a Home Office department known as C3. Peirce was a fan of the CCRC in its early days. “At the beginning, the commissioners who were first appointed were strong, confident individuals who’d had successful careers in another field. There was an energy there, and the original commissioners had a motivation to get cases referred back.”

That’s long gone now, she says. Today, the commission is underfunded, conservative, rarely uses its investigative powers and is unbelievably slow. Critics say that, rather than providing a gateway to justice, the CCRC acts as a gatekeeper for the Court of Appeal.

In 2023, Andrew Malkinson had his conviction for rape overturned 14 years after first submitting grounds to appeal to the CCRC. Last week, Peter Sullivan had his conviction for the murder of 21-year-old Diane Sindall overturned after spending 38 years in prison – thought to be the longest in British history that a person has been imprisoned before being cleared. The sentence was quashed after Sullivan applied to the CCRC again in 2021 and new forensics tests revealed that his DNA was not on samples preserved at the time. Sullivan first applied to the CCRC in 2008, asking the commission to look at DNA evidence that could exonerate him. Back then, testing was cruder, the CCRC was told by forensic scientists that they were unlikely to be able to recover useful DNA, and his application was rejected. The same testing technique led to his conviction being overturned 17 years later. Critics say if the CCRC had been more assertive or proactive, Sullivan would have been cleared years ago. On Friday, a committee of MPs published a damning report on the CCRC calling on its chief executive, Karen Kneller, to resign. In January, its chair Helen Pitcher resigned after successive justice secretaries indicated that they had lost confidence in her.

In the case of the Birmingham Four, Gareth Peirce believes they are hampered by all the evidence of police misconduct that came out at their trial. If it had emerged after the trial, she would have an easier job in convincing the CCRC to refer the case back to the Court of Appeal because the CCRC relies so heavily on “new” evidence in its considerations. “Every single thing that happened would have led to the case being reopened and the conviction quashed,” she says, “but because it all came out in a trial, the CCRC can say the jury heard all this and they convicted.”

The commission can demand to see evidence that was not disclosed to the defence. Peirce is convinced this would provide even more proof of an unsafe conviction. “They have the power to find internal evidence of discussions and decisions within police departments, but all they’ve done so far is send preservation orders to different bodies to preserve their records.”

At the end of the prosecution’s evidence, Peirce asked the judge to strip the undercover officers of their anonymity on the basis they had perjured themselves, most notably in saying they had not been in touch with each other throughout the court case. Justice Globe refused, rejecting the allegation of perjury. The police being undercover is a huge obstacle to justice, says Peirce. For example, if the defence had known Vincent’s real identity, it could have checked his spending history to see whether he had bought any of the items found in the bag, and tested his DNA and fingerprints to see if they matched that found on the tape. (The defence asked the prosecution to make both of these checks, but it refused.) In previous cases, Peirce has been able to investigate the history of officers she has suspected of corruption. Here, she is working in a vacuum.

It’s more than a year since she submitted grounds for appeal to the CCRC on behalf of Ali and Hussain. “It’s like a thriller that explains everything – the dynamics of the trial, the jury’s reactions, the impact of the terror attacks. It’s got everything they need to know.” The problem is, Peirce says, the CCRC is ossified and takes years to reach a decision. “So my next task is: ‘I’m going to point you to what you can do – forget all the rest, I’ll just point you to X, Y, Z.’” She’s talking to me, but addressing the CCRC. “We’ve baked your cake. All you need is a crumb and you’ll find more than a crumb here.”

Peirce and Mariam make a good team. “We know the CCRC have higher powers,” says Mariam. “They don’t need to be too fixated on new evidence. It’s just that this body chooses not to use those powers.’”

“So the case has been presented in both ways,” Peirce continues. “We’ve said there’s enough here for you to just send it back. However, if you think there needs to be more, this is the more that didn’t come out, or this is the route to more.” When I ask what the more is, she becomes coy. “A couple of things I can’t tell you because they’re personal and they require consent, which we don’t have.”

There’s another problem, Peirce says. Lack of popular support. Again, it’s familiar to her. She experienced it when she took on Irish cases decades ago. Now it’s the same with Muslims. And what further complicates matters is the previous convictions of the two men she’s representing. “We’re in a very tricky situation because the subject is terrorism. And if you’re a convicted terrorist there isn’t a great lot of sympathy there.” Her frustration is visceral. As far as she is concerned, she’s dealing with a blatant miscarriage of justice that is destroying the lives of four men and their families.

I talk to Peirce soon after the death of Paddy Hill, a member of the Birmingham Six. She says it’s a reminder that history does repeat itself. “There are significant similarities between the Birmingham Six and Birmingham Four. The defendants were members of suspect communities, and evidence was fabricated with utter arrogance and self-justification by the police.” She refers to it as “noble cause corruption” – the belief that a group of people are dangerous and need to be taken out, with the ends justifying the means. “These undercover police are clearly corrupt and dishonest. Having defined themselves as being there for a purpose – to get suspects out of the way permanently – they have succeeded in doing so for decades.”

Mariam exhales loudly, and says she is praying the CCRC does the right thing – and quickly. “Every second wasted is so precious,” she says.

When asked to comment, West Midlands Police told the Guardian: “In 2018, a full Court of Appeal examined the safety of these convictions in great detail and upheld the findings of the jury.”

The Guardian asked the CCRC if it had ordered West Midlands Police and MI5 to hand over relevant documents that were not disclosed at the trial and whether there is a mechanism to speed up the review process. “I can confirm we have received applications on behalf of Mr Hussain, Mr Ali and Mr Aziz, and reviews are underway. It would be inappropriate to comment further while the reviews are ongoing,” a CCRC spokesperson said.

The impact on the families

In Sparkhill, Birmingham, Hussain’s father Shab is watching the snooker, cheering on Ronnie O’Sullivan. He’s just finished his shift as a cab driver. In the kitchen, Hussain’s mother Nusrat is cooking up lamb and loki, cauliflower and potato, pakoras, bhajis and chapatis. Mariam and her husband Faisal join us. Then Ali’s brother Ghaf and his mother pop round from next door. Neither family can disguise their devastation.

Around the dinner table they discuss all sorts – the mindset evidence, miscarriages of justice in general, Liverpool’s premier league title and who is the greatest snooker player ever.

But inevitably it returns to the case of the four men, and in particular their two boys. Ali’s elderly mother Parveen, who doesn’t speak English, clasps her hands in prayer. Ghaf translates. “She’s saying: ‘Can you help us?’ We’ve had so much stress. My dad passed away while Naweed’s been in prison and Mum says he didn’t get a chance to see his father, and she’s worried he won’t get a chance to see her.”

Nine years on, they still can’t get their heads around what happened. Ghaf boils it down. “Do they think Naweed is such an idiot that he’s going to go to work with a bomb in his car, and give them his keys?”

“Who the hell would do that ?” Shab says. “That’s the thing that gets me. Think about it. First shift!”

Hussain phones while we’re eating. The family hangs on his every word. He tells them what he’s been up to – doing his shift in the workshop, assembling headphones for Virgin Atlantic; gym early evening; bang-up at 6.30pm. He talks about what he would like the world to know about his case. “I just want people to know that miscarriage of justices do happen and people can get wrongly convicted and lost in the system. People know what happened in my trial, but the narrative always gets spun in a way, depending on the verdict. So if you get found guilty they’ll paint you into a monster.”

One reason he has found himself lost in the system is that the Ministry of Justice has made it so difficult for him to campaign against his conviction. The governor of the category A prison he is in rejected my request for a visit and the prison returned the letters I sent him.

After the cache of deleted police messages resurfaced, Hussain says he was sure the case would be dropped. “If Vincent, the key witness for the police, is in contempt of court and we’ve shown that their evidence is fabricated, surely the case has to be dropped. Stephen Kamlish burst into the room and said: ‘That’s it lads, we’re going home.’ He was so excited. But then it dawned on me that I was looking at getting convicted because of the climate.”

As Hussain talks to his family, it becomes obvious how aware he is of life passing him by. He says it’s his family and faith that are keeping him strong. “I know the truth always comes out in the end, and that keeps me going.” It’s not simply about recognising the innocence of the Birmingham Four, he adds, it’s equally important to address the behaviour of the police. “What about the guys who put us in jail? Unless there are proper repercussions for their actions, this kind of behaviour is going to carry on.”

After he says his farewells, everybody looks at each other, deflated.

“Don’t get me wrong, there are people with these ideologies,” Shab says. “If Khobaib had done something, I would say, yes, let him rot in there. But what boils my blood is all the evidence is there. They were monitoring him for months and didn’t find anything. At the end of the day, think about it, they’ve lost their life. Look at the family – what we have to suffer through. Over what?”

Seconds after a catastrophic series of power outages struck across the UK in the summer of 2019, a phone rang in the control room of the Dinorwig hydropower plant in north Wales. It was Britain’s energy system operator requesting an immediate deluge of electricity to help prevent a wide-scale blackout crippling Britain’s power grids.

The response was swift, and in the end just under one million people were left without power for less than 45 minutes. While trains were stuck on lines for hours and hospitals had to revert to backup generators, that phone call prevented Britain’s worst blackout in a decade from being far more severe.

Almost six years later, the owners of Dinorwig, and its sister plant at Ffestiniog on the boundary of Eryri national park, formerly Snowdonia, are preparing to pump up to £1bn into a 10-year refurbishment of the hydropower plants that have quietly helped to keep the lights on for decades.

Ffestiniog was one of the first pumped hydroelectric systems in the UK when it opened in 1963, while nearby Dinorwig – the largest and fastest-acting pumped storage station in Europe – followed in 1984. The refurbishment could mean the plants continue to provide reliable clean energy on demand for decades to come – and serve as giant grid batteries to store Britain’s renewable electricity for when it is needed most.

Miya Paolucci, the UK boss of the French energy company Engie, one of Dinorwig’s owners, said refurbishing the plant will cost a third of the investment needed to build a new hydropower plant on a similar scale, making the overhaul an “intuitive” decision to secure another 25 years of life from the “much-loved” power station.

Britain has used gravity and the flow of water to generate electricity since 1878, when a hydroelectric generator first powered an arc lamp at the Cragside manor house in Northumberland. The project involved dropping water 100 metres vertically to turn a Siemens generator that would go on to power a series of newly invented incandescent lightbulbs in the country house.

Dinorwig and Ffestiniog use the same principles as the Cragside manor house to generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of almost 2 million UK households in a matter of seconds. When power is plentiful, the plants use electricity to pump water from a lower reservoir up to an elevated dam. Later, when power supplies are tight, the water is released to drive the turbines, generating power.

Dinorwig or Mynydd Gwefru, as it is known locally, can be called upon to generate electricity within 75 seconds by releasing 86,000 gallons of water a second down a cavernous 500-metre vertical tunnel. The water crashes into six turbines, each weighing about 500 tonnes, which generate high-volume blasts of renewable power on demand.

Overall, hydropower makes up only 2% of the UK’s total electricity – but often at times when its electrons are at their most vital to keeping the lights on. It provides many of the key benefits of large fossil fuel power plants – but without the carbon emissions.

Unlike wind and solar farms, hydropower projects can be called upon by the system operator at specific times when the grid needs more generation to meet demand. The spinning mass of its generators can also help to stabilise the frequency of the power grid at about 50Hz, the level required to avoid power outages. In the event of a blackout, hydropower can even help to restart the power system.

But after 140 years generating electricity it is hydropower’s potential as an energy storage technology that is key to its future. Pumped hydropower can effectively work as a long-duration battery by using renewable electricity when it is abundant to pump water up into a reservoir and release the water to generate electricity when renewable energy wanes.

Unlike grid batteries, which are often designed to charge during the day and discharge electricity at night, long-duration energy storage systems can store energy for hours, days or even weeks so it can be used when needed.

The government hopes to bring forward investment in 18GW of storage by 2035, of which 10GW should be long-duration storage such as hydropower. But pumped hydropower projects are struggling to find a place in Britain’s energy landscape

There are geographic hurdles: there are only so many vast mountains and brimming reservoirs, and the projects can also provoke concerns within the local community. But in locations where they are viable developers have been left to wait for government officials to confirm the details of its financial support framework.

One of the UK’s biggest renewable energy developers, SSE, hopes that its Coire Glas project in the Scottish Highlands could be the first major pumped storage hydro scheme built in the UK in more than 40 years.

The project could power 3 million homes for up to 24 hours, and would nearly double Great Britain’s total current electricity storage capacity, but it needs the final details of a government support scheme before SSE can fully commit to the project.

A House of Lords report published late last year warned that a large-scale rollout of long-duration energy storage technologies was “not being treated with sufficient urgency”.

The report found that a wide-scale rollout would allow more renewable power to be available, potentially lowering the overall cost of electricity for consumers.

Better energy storage could, the committee said, make the grid more flexible and avoid paying to switch off wind and solar farms when there is more clean power being generated than consumers can use.

Paolucci said: “Flexible storage is essential for net zero carbon operation of Britain’s electricity system. It helps balance the system by ensuring there’s always a large volume of ‘back-up’ power on standby, that can be delivered in very fast timescales if required. We’re very proud to contribute to the electricity security of supply and green energy ambition of the UK with these extraordinary assets.”

A vacation lodge known as the Wagon Box Inn in the tiny town of Story, Wyoming, has emerged as an unlikely hub of rightwing ambitions to reorient US politics and culture.

Events held there since it opened, and others planned for this spring, have brought together figures from the so-called “dissident right”, political figures backed by reactionary currents in Silicon Valley, and proponents of the “network state” movement.

The dissident right is a term that describes rightwing intellectual currents that go beyond and even attack mainstream conservatives for their perceived concessions to liberals on issues like race, feminism and LGBTQ+ rights. Network state proponents envision a network of extra-national communities that exist beyond the control of nation-states.

The Guardian contacted the Wagon Box founder and owner Paul McNiel for comment. He did not respond directly but instead posted a screenshot of the request to X appended with commentary.

There, McNiel said he was driven by “good-faith curiosity” that events there had been “largely focused on a suspicion of ‘the machine’” and boasted of the “breadth of the politics represented”, citing appearances by the likes of Patrick Deneen and Seneca Scott.

Deneen is a Notre Dame professor and conservative political theorist whose 2023 book Regime Change “offered a preview of the Trump administration’s intention to breathe fire on America’s cultural institutions” whose fans include JD Vance, the vice-president.

Scott, who McNiel described as a “90s Democrat who wants a safe community for his family and goats”, is a former union organizer based in Oakland, California, whose activism, political campaigning and social media output have targeted transgender people, homeless encampments, local media organizations, progressive politicians and city employees.

‘Liberalism is crumbling’

Sheridan county property records indicate that Paul McNiel bought the property that includes the Wagon Box – formerly a holiday destination and RV park – in August 2022.

Property records, satellite imagery, and media posted on social media platforms and on the Wagon Box website indicate a semi-rural location on the western fringes of Story.

Since McNiel took control of the property, it has played host to a string of events, many of them featuring figures associated with overlapping rightwing movements.

The project has drawn concerns in local media, but garnered a laudatory write-up in the Bari Weiss-founded Free Press. Free Press investors include rightwing tech figures like Marc Andreessen and Trump administration “crytpo czar” David Sacks.

McNiel – billed as a millionaire in an appearance on a real estate investment podcast in 2021 – is the principal of a legion of LLCs, according to company records in Alaska, Wyoming, Montana and North Carolina.

Property records and data brokers indicate that McNiel or LLCs controlled by him have bought and sold dozens of properties – many of them trailer parks or similar sites for low-cost housing – in at least three states.

According to founding documents on its website, Wagon Box is run as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), a term for organizations managed in part via decentralized technologies like blockchains and smart contracts.

A 2021 Wyoming law allows DAOs to incorporate in the state, despite their often anonymous ownership structure. The sparsely populated state is notorious for a “cowboy cocktail” of loose financial regulations and opaque company ownership.

“We’re not northern Idaho or even Montana. We’ve so far managed to not attract the crazy far right to our state,” said Elizabeth Storer, a Democratic state representative from Jackson who has spoken critically of Wyoming’s libertarian financial laws and opacity.

“We’ve allowed just about anyone to come into Wyoming because of our low tax environment, our limited liability corporation laws and the use of registered agents all over the state – it allows people to offshore funds in Wyoming with a great deal of secrecy,” she added.

The current version of a document explaining the DAO aligns the project with the network state movement, claiming that “the grand project of liberalism is crumbling, and that in its wake people are looking for new avenues of allegiance and interdependence”.

The document continues “Balaji Srinivasan, among others, has identified this shift and suggested a process for uniting modern technologies with ancient human trends of association to create network states”, providing a link to Srinivasan’s self-published 2022 book of the same name.

Reverse diasporas

Srinavisan is an entrepreneur and investor formerly associated with companies including Andreessen-Horowitz and Coinbase. (That company’s current CEO, Brian Armstrong, is another outspoken booster of network states).

For more than a decade, Srinivasan has advocated a radical anarcho-capitalist vision in which like-minded people can “exit” and place themselves beyond the legal and economic reach of nation-states in parallel, networked special economic zones.

His ideas are often couched in vituperative attacks on his perceived enemies, including academics, government employees and the media.

As early as 2013, Srinavisan was advocating a “reverse diaspora” in which people enabled by technology could assemble in “cloud cities … outside the United States”. These “could be floating cities in international waters as put forth by Peter Thiel, or one of the more ambitious 80,000 person colonies on Mars desired by Elon Musk”.

Soon after, in response to reporting linking Silicon Valley figures to the anti-democratic neo-reactionary movement and its leading light, Curtis Yarvin, Srinavasan reportedly emailed Yarvin with the suggestion that “it may be interesting to sic the Dark Enlightenment audience on a single vulnerable hostile reporter to dox them and turn them inside out”.

He later cited Yarvin in The Network State, writing: “As Yarvin in particular has documented at length, the most important left-authoritarians are not formally part of the elected state at all. They are the professors, activists, bureaucrats, and journalists.”

He describes people in these fields as constituting “the control circuitry for the US government”.

Last September, he opened a residential network school for would-be builders of network nations, reportedly located in Malaysia’s Forest City, whose “requirements include an admiration of ‘western values’, seeing Bitcoin as the successor to the US Federal Reserve, and trusting AI over human courts and judges”.

The network state vision has already inspired an attempt to build a city, California Forever, in rural Solano county, with investors including Andreessen and the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Network state advocates also reportedly want to construct a similar “charter city” in Greenland if it is annexed by the United States.

Donald Trump has floated the idea of creating 10 such “freedom cities” on federal land, including San Francisco’s Presidio.

The movement also overlaps with efforts to mount a rightwing takeover of city governments in San Francisco and Oakland, with the likes of the Y Combinator CEO, Garry Tan, backing both projects.

Srinivasan has offered lurid fantasies of what a tech-controlled San Francisco might look like. In an October 2023 podcast interview, he envisioned a city controlled by tech-aligned “grays” enjoying privileged access to large parts of the city, bribing a pliant police department, and with “blues” – San Francisco’s liberals – subject to exclusion and hostile propaganda.

Devin Burghart, the executive director of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Righs and a longtime observer of far-right organizing in the mountain west, told the Guardian in an interview that the Wagon Box was significant for being one of the first real-world attempts at constructing a “network state” hub beyond California.

“They’ve tipped their hand a bit with the constant references to [accelerationist theorist] Nick Land and Italian futurism. This is a different veneer of the apocalyptic, post-democratic world view that is also quite common with militia and prepper types.”

The Wagon Box reportedly attracted immediate scepticism from residents of tiny unincorporated Story in the months following its establishment.

Attenders at a 2023 public meeting reportedly expressed concerns both about the draft DAO document’s vision of “‘capital seed for a nascent network state’ and … a place for either gatherings or apocalyptic retreat”, and McNiel’s association with the notorious anti-government activist Ryan Payne.

In 2018, Payne was sentenced to federal prison on conspiracy charges after playing the role of, according to a federal judge, “an architect” of the 2016 Malheur national wildlife refuge occupation, in which he participated alongside the likes of the current fugitive Ammon Bundy.

‘A criminal regime’

Wagon Box has hosted a series of events since McNiel’s acquisition, many with guests and themes associated with the far right.

The 27 April event, Dawn in the West: A Futurist Serata (DitW) was subtitled “An UncleTed Talk”, a reference both to Ted talks and a nickname for the so-called Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski.

Advertising materials highlighted themes including the work of Land, who, alongside Yarvin, is one of the progenitors of the neo-reactionary movement, whose anti-democratic ideas have been cited as an inspiration for the Trump administration’s gutting of the federal government.

Another advertised speaker at that event was Jonathan Keeperman. The Guardian identified Keeperman in 2024 as the man behind the L0m3z X account and rightwing publisher Passage Press.

Keeperman-founded Passage Press is also listed as a participant in Wagon Box’s 31 May roundtable Coalition for Cultural Renewal (CCR).

The schedule for a Wagon Box event last August promised a conversation between Keeperman and the journalist James Pogue on “the failure of liberalism and globalization”.

Pogue has written extensively about the new right for media outlets including the New York Times and Vanity Fair.

In a post at the Wagon Box’s Substack newsletter, Pogue and McNiel are pictured together in a photograph purportedly taken inside the Passage-Press-sponsored Coronation Ball in Washington this January, and described in a caption as “Wagon Box brothers”.

Keeperman is one of the overlaps between Wagon Box and a broader far-right milieu.

Keeperman, for example, spoke last month at a pro-natalist conference in Austin, Texas, whose speaker roster included self-described eugenicists and promoters of race science.

At the event, in response to a small protest on site, Keeperman took to X, posting: “NATALISM IS NAZISM Say it loud say it proud.”

Balaji Srinivasan spoke at the same conference in 2023.

The Natalism conference founder, Kevin Dolan, is listed in Texas company records as the principal of a natalism.org non-profit; a newly incorporated Eternal Capital Texas Inc; and Exit, a men-only organization which he characterized in a Substack newsletter as a rightwing business network which is “not just about making life in the regime more tolerable … setting ourselves up to succeed as it declines”.

He founded that organization following Guardian reporting in 2021 that identified him as the man behind an influential “DezNat” account, “@extradeadjcb”.

Exit is billed as a participant in Wagon Box’s CCR event, which will include other far-right publishers , along with Murphy’s Other Life and hard-right online magazine IM-1776.

The Guardian previously reported on IM-1776’s support of authoritarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin and El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele; its enthusiasm for extremist political figures such as Gabriele D’Annunzio and Kaczynski; and its close links with contemporary hard-right activists like the culture warrior Christopher Rufo, Erik Prince and would-be “warlord” Charles Haywood.

IM-1776’s literary editor, Daniel Miller, is a speaker at DitW, and in YouTube videos posted to Wagon Box’s channel he is characterized as a writer-in-residence.

In a January article for IM-1776, Miller called for Donald Trump to overthrow the government of the UK led by Keir Starmer and “liberate” the country, saying it was run by “a criminal regime” dominated by “a mafia-like organization of pathological personalities”, a necessity “as clear as the imperative of the Vietnamese to invade Cambodia and remove the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979”.

Miller did not respond to a request for comment.

The Oakland connection

Events this spring also bill speakers associated with a tech-backed hard-right political movement in California’s Bay Area.

Scott – who has run both for city council and mayor in Oakland – is set to appear at the Doomer Optimism Campout in June.

Scott’s political activities in Oakland – including the candidacies and his advocacy for the recall of former mayor Sheng Thao last year – have been punctuated by scandals.

During his 2022 campaign media reports revealed a 2021 arrest on charges of brandishing a firearm, in an incident that took place not far from the community garden he founded in West Oakland. Those charges were later dismissed.

Last December, the city of Oakland applied for a restraining order against Scott over his alleged harassment of a city worker during the recall campaign. Among other things, Scott reportedly claimed that the employee was a pedophile on social media and posted their address publicly. In a February settlement, Scott agreed to stop posting personal information about the employee online.

Scott has received backing from rightwing tech figures including Tan, who, like Scott, has agitated against progressive approaches to homelessness and law and order, and employed bareknuckle social-media posting to promote his views.

“If you want Oakland to be great then you will follow and support Seneca,” Tan wrote on X last year.

In Oakland, Scott has drawn scrutiny for anti-transgender commentary and attacks on progressive voices in politics and media.

Scott appeared at another Wagon Box event in summer 2024 in conversation about “Cities: urban agriculture, crime, and criminal justice reform”.

Pogue also appeared alongside Scott at his community garden in a 2023 event hosted by a Scott-run non-profit, Neighbors Together Oakland, that was last year shuttered by California’s attorney general last year for conducting fundraising without a non-profit license.

In an interview with Free Press in 2023, Scott had said he planned to use that non-profit as a platform to support “100 nontraditional candidates” for city councils, school boards, and potentially higher offices across the US.

Another Doomer Optimism Campout speaker is Andrew Hock, a Tennessee political consultant who was reportedly involved with an alleged attempt to facilitate anonymous donations in support of the recall of Mayor Thao.

Questions about Foundational Oakland Unite’s fundraising came amid a flood of campaign money into pro-recall groups, much of it from big-money donors. As previously reported in the Guardian, deep-pocketed tech figures have been involved in attempts to drag politics to the right in Oakland and San Francisco.

In April, 2024 the Thao recall campaign sent an email to prospective donors offering “options for donors to remain private if you prefer”. Oakland city law forbids anonymous donations to political candidates. The message included an email address for Andrew Hock at Foundational Oakland Unites, a political action committee founded by Scott, as the main point of contact for donations.

According to 2024 reporting by the Oaklandside, Scott previously employed Hock as a paid campaign consultant during his 2022 mayoral campaign.

Scott claims to be a part-owner of Hock’s campaign consultant group, Laschian Consulting. In an April 17 post to X, Scott claimed that Laschian Consulting “has planted its flag and is already in talks to help other major US cities fight back against the soggies and their anti-human agenda”, using a self-coined derogatory term to refer to social democrats.

“If your city is spiraling due to failed progressive policies and a coordinated NGO + public sector union takeover, give us a call. Maybe we can help you save your city too.”

In January, Thao, the recalled mayor, was herself federally indicted over allegations including that she solicited political donations in violation of campaign finance laws.

The alleged straw donor campaign for Thao was uncovered by Oakland’s Public Ethics Commission in an investigation that began half a decade ago. Though the PEC did not make a criminal referral, FBI white-collar crime investigators in Oakland picked up the thread and built their own criminal case independently.

The PEC’s budget was slashed earlier this year amid a citywide fiscal crisis, severely impacting its ability to complete ongoing investigations.

Hock did not respond to requests for comment.

I have been dating my boyfriend (we are both in our 20s) for almost a year. I’m absolutely smitten. He makes me feel a better person, and I believe we are really good together.

Sadly, he doesn’t have a very good relationship with his family. I haven’t really seen this play out because I’ve not seen them together that often, but he’s told me about his childhood and that he discusses his family in his regular therapy sessions.

I, on the other hand, have a really positive relationship with my family. I am aware of how much of a privilege this is, but I am worried I can’t really understand how his childhood affects who he is and how he acts, and that I can’t support or know him properly.

He has mentioned how unusual he finds a family that spends time with each other and interacts positively, which breaks my heart.

I would love to invite my boyfriend to spend more time with my family, but don’t want to pull him away from his own or seem like I’m “showing off” mine. We did a special trip to introduce him to my parents, and on some level, I feel like not doing a similar thing with his parents or siblings means he doesn’t feel as strongly towards me as I do towards him (I’ve only ever seen his parents in passing), which makes me sad. I know this isn’t the case, but it’s hard for me to separate emotion and logic here.

It makes me feel unsure about our future. I don’t know what sort of parent he would make. I don’t know what sort of parent I’d make either, or whether we would even choose to have kids. I know a lot of the time people who have abusive parents make great parents because they know how it felt to have otherwise.

Can you help me get some clarity on how I should think about this?

Well, first: wow for being such an amazing and thoughtful partner. I went to UKCP-accredited psychotherapist Katherine Walker, who is the author of Step Up, a book about blended families. “I would not underestimate the importance of what your relationship means to your partner,” Walker assured. “Having a safe and loving relationship with someone who encourages you to be your best self is the holy grail of what most spend their time searching for, and it sounds like you’ve [both] already found that!”

Walker emphasised that it’s OK to have different experiences of our families: “You won’t be spending most of your time with them, so as long as your relationship itself is strong, everything else is a really lovely bonus. Diversity is vital. If we were all the same we’d never appreciate our privileges [as you do]; neither would we have the opportunity to observe a healthier dynamic and learn to question things when we are/were treated badly.”

If and when you get to talking about children, a good idea might be therapy for both of you, to discuss your expectations

You are right that how we are parented (and I would say how our siblings treated us too) affects us. But we can either choose to emulate that or challenge it and change it (or, what most people do: a bit of both). It sounds as if your boyfriend is already doing that by talking about his family when he wants to and going to therapy, so he’s changing the script. Walker explained that sometimes people are quite blind to how they were brought up and never think about it or discuss it. “When things are kept in the shadows,” she said, “and not worked with, we don’t have the opportunity to grow or learn.”

Your relationship is only a year old. It’s young but sounds extremely promising. If and when you get to talking about children, a good idea might be therapy for both of you, to discuss what your expectations are (if only more people did this!).

You said in your longer letter that you didn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable by asking questions, but both Walker and I think that, while you shouldn’t bombard him, it’s an idea to let him know that he can talk with you if he wants to. “If you can learn to develop a healthy and open communication style now, when your relationship is in its relatively early stages, it will pay dividends as your relationship matures,” she said. “It can also give him the opportunity to say how he feels about spending more time with your family. At the moment you’re projecting how you think he might feel.”

Overall, there’s lots of promise in your relationship – for discussion, connection and a happier future. Try not to worry too much; there’s far more to celebrate.

Lowther Castle, Cumbria

In the dash for Cumbria’s lakes and fells, the area’s other green attractions can get missed. On Knipe Scar, at the edge of the Lake District national park, Lowther’s acres sprawl around the shell of a ruined 19th-century castle. Wildflower meadows, bee-friendly tree hives and rambling woodland contrast with a parterre, sculptured hornbeams and a Sleeping Beauty-inspired rose garden designed by Dan Pearson. Bikes and ebikes can be rented for pootling around the estate’s trails or perhaps a five-mile cycle to Ullswater. There is a Lost Castle adventure playground and a cafe. Before leaving, visit the west terrace for views across the Lowther valley to distant fells. Open daily, adults £15, children £10, lowthercastle.org

Rousham House, Oxfordshire

View image in fullscreen Photograph: Britain Gardens and Flowers/Alamy

While filming his BBC British Gardens series, Monty Don described Rousham as “one of my favourite gardens of all and one of the truly great gardens of the world”. Rousham is the handiwork of William Kent (1685-1748), whose imaginative use of follies, mysterious “ta-da” avenues and one of the earliest ha-has blur the line between fantasy and reality. A master of the unbroken view, Kent manipulated the landscape to create a harmonious flow between the garden, the surrounding countryside and Rousham’s castellated pile. The estate’s 10 hectares (25 acres) include kitchen gardens, a rill, classical statuary, cascades and a seven-arched colonnade overlooking the River Cherwell. The house is still owned by the family who employed Kent to reshape the garden centuries ago. No cafe or children under 15, but picnics are encouraged. House tours on request.

View image in fullscreen Photograph: Val Corbett

On Ynys Môn (Anglesey) with views to Eryri national park (Snowdonia), Plas Cadnant feels like a portal to another world. As 70 years’ worth of undergrowth was peeled away, the present owner discovered enchanting spaces, including a walled garden that dips in a graceful catenary curve and a woodland garden containing the remains of a 19th-century folly. Steps lead down to an enchanting “valley garden” where four waterfalls splosh into the River Cadnant. Some of the outbuildings and a gardener’s cottage have been converted into holiday accommodation, and guests have full access to the gardens and parkland.

Open April-Oct, adults £11.50, concs £2.50-£10.50, plascadnant.co.uk. The Coach House, from £720 for three nights for up to seven people

Dilston Physic Garden, Northumberland

View image in fullscreen Photograph: David Taylor Photography/Alamy

Set in rolling countryside close to the Devil’s Water river, Dilston is a garden that whispers “slow down”. Over three decades, a hectare of agricultural land has been transformed into a flourishing wildlife garden filled with more than 700 flowers, herbs, vegetables and trees planted with biodiversity and natural healing in mind. A rewilding and wetland area has encouraged native flora, such as the Northumbrian bloody cranesbill, to thrive. Visit the “spirit henge”, breathe in the fragrant camomile lawn, wander the labyrinth and buy products made with ingredients from the garden in the shop (proceeds to the registered charity). Dilston is on the Corbridge Heritage Trail, and a scenic 20-minute walk along the Tyne from Corbridge station.

Armed with a 19th-century Ordnance Survey map and a black-and-white photo, the owners of the Old Vicarage picked up their shovels and set about restoring the acres around their house on the north Norfolk coast. The result, 40 years on, is a practical and creative triumph featuring beautiful gardens, an enfilade of lawns and an “apple walk”. Some of the traditional – and windproof – wildlife habitat lost to modern farming methods is now restored. The Arizona-inspired Desert Wash garden is planted with drought-tolerant plants such as South American bromeliads, agaves and aloe. The cornfield has self-seeding poppies, corn marigolds and corn camomile, and there are shelterbelts of Monterey pine, Italian alders, holm oak and eucalyptus. A meditative space contains 16 Indian bean trees.

From swept gravel and teahouses, to stone lanterns and zigzag bridges, every aspect of a Japanese garden holds meaning. At Cowden you can unpick the symbolism or simply enjoy the garden in its purest sense – as a tranquil space where everything is in its place. Cowden was inspired by the travels of a wealthy adventurer, Ella Christie, who commissioned Japanese horticulturist Taki Handa to design a garden in the boggy grounds of her home, Cowden Castle. A 10-year restoration, completed in 2023, was overseen by Chelsea flower show gold and best in show winner Prof Masao Fukuhara. The gardens undulate through woodland and over gentle hills dotted with cherry blossom, maples and acers. On the Christie Walk, you might spot Indian rhubarb, the heart-shaped leaves of the katsura tree and the petals of the Himalayan blue poppy fluttering in the breeze. Workshops include cyanotype printing and kintsugi (the art of repairing pottery).

You may have seen this 16th-century, English Heritage-listed house and its garden “rooms” on screen in Disney’s Christopher Robin, ITV’s Agatha Christie’s Poirot or the BBC’s 2017 adaptation of EM Forster’s Howards End. A Gertrude Jekyll-designed water garden is a highlight of the 2 hectares. Crossed by bridges and stone paths, the water garden contains 1,500 plants nurtured at Jekyll’s Munstead Wood nursery. Traditional rose varieties bloom in the Old Garden, and an orchard leads to a yew walk where pears fruit on a crinkle crankle wall and ferns sprout from Bargate stone – the medieval quarries that provided it can still be seen in the surrounding hills.

Donated to the public by the soap magnate Lord Leverhulme in 1902, Rivington sits within Lever Park on the edge of the West Pennine Moors. Leverhulme went all out by commissioning an unusual seven-arched bridge based on one he had seen in Nigeria, a sitting room at the top of a four-storey pigeon tower, five summer houses set on lawns and a replica of Liverpool Castle. In all, there are 11 Grade-II listed structures to explore (suffragette Edith Rigby burned down Lever’s original house) along with rock gardens and grottoes, a wide variety of fungi, a Japanese garden and an Italian lake, where Leverhulme took daily dips.

Trelissick, Cornwall

With its small beach, ancient Cornish orchard and pontoon on the River Fal, the National Trust’s Trelissick isn’t your average garden. Paths wind through Brobdingnagian sub-tropical gardens, and dawn-till-dusk woodland walks bring snapshots of the river. Spring delivers magnolias, camellias, rhododendrons and fountains of wisteria; later in the year, it’s the turn of ginger lilies, dahlias and bananas. The King Harry Ferry departs from Trelissick to St Mawes and Falmouth, and there is a lovely walk around Restronguet Creek to the thatched-roofed Pandora Inn (allow three hours for the walk) for a creekside afternoon tea. The orchard’s restored screw-turn apple press will be in action over Apple Weekend in October. Stay the night in Trelissick Tower, or the restored Trelissick Engine House, and enjoy access to the garden.

The restored 18th-century walled garden at Hillsborough is a gem. Walking around the beds you will see heritage varieties such as golden beetroot mixed with modern ones such as par-cel (which looks like parsley but tastes like celery). Visit the cafe for garden-to-plate “walled garden scallion potato bread” and an afternoon tea featuring a “garden beetroot brownie” and “walled garden raspberry posset with thyme shortbread”. The rest of the garden is full of interest. The lake is fed by a stream which meanders through the gardens, and a pinetum contains a stand of giant sequoias planted in the 1870s. In the grotto, a statue of the Irish warrior poet Ossian and an accompanying bench and stones tell his story and explain the castle’s links to the romantic movement and the Gaelic revival.

The Arts and Crafts Manor House at Upton Grey is striking in its own right, but laid around it is a garden with a rare boast: it is believed to be the most complete and authentic existing example of a Gertrude Jekyll-designed garden. When owners John and Rosamund Wallinger purchased the 2‑hectare site in 1984, it was nearly derelict, but after they discovered the eminent garden designer’s original plans for the garden, they embarked upon a remarkable journey of faithful restoration. Situated east of Basingstoke, Upton Grey features wild, kitchen and rose gardens, the nuttery, and a yew-hedged formal garden filled with the hallmarks of Jekyll planting design: lofty hollyhocks and azure delphiniums, billowing phlox, poppies and campanulas.

Iford Manor, Wiltshire

One of Britain’s premier romantic gardens, Iford Manor meets formality with enrapturing naturalism: euphorbia and catmint soften the stone terraces, roses clamber up the columns; a 200-year-old wisteria romps in unbridled profusion. Located on the edge of the Cotswolds, beside the River Frome in Wiltshire, Iford was the home in the early 20th century of influential architect and garden designer Harold Peto, who augmented its Georgian roots with Italianate flare and finesse. There are intimate cloisters and grand steps, a tranquil Japanese garden, and masterfully positioned statues and architectural fragments, while more modern additions include an award-winning restaurant and bakery. For the last half-century, Iford has been under the stewardship of the Cartwright-Hignett family who, with current head gardener Steve Lannin, are continuing the garden’s expressive legacy. Book in advance to ensure entry.

Additional reporting by Matt Collins

You park the car and look for somewhere to pay. A large QR code on the machine offers to take you directly to the right website where you put in your card details before going on with your day. Only much later are you hit with the double whammy: money gone from your account, and a fine for not paying the genuine parking company.

The rise in app- and phone-based parking payment has opened a new frontier for fraudsters: quishing – so called because they are phishing attacks that start with a QR code. The fraudsters stick the codes in places where you would expect to see details of how to pay to park. When you scan one, it takes you to a site where you are asked for your payment details – as you would expect when booking parking.

One victim who scanned a code in a station car park told the BBC that the fraudsters tried to take payments then posed as her bank to get more information from her, before running up £13,000 worth of debt in her name.

Last year, the UK’s Action Fraud received 1,386 reports of scams involving QR codes – a small number, but more than double that in the previous year. In just the first three months of 2025 there were 502, suggesting the problem is growing.

Chris Ainsley, the head of fraud risk management at Santander UK, says it is hard to get a full picture of the scale of the fraud. “Unless drivers receive a parking ticket, a lot of people are unaware that their personal or card details were compromised in this way,” he says. “When it comes to reporting the eventual scam, often the fact that it originated through quishing goes undocumented.”

What the scam looks like

A QR code where you might expect to see one – on a parking charge machine, on a post in a car park or sometimes on a public EV charger.

View image in fullscreen Be suspicious of any QR code on a parking payment machine or signpost in a car park. Check that it has not been stuck over a legitimate code. Photograph: dowell/Getty Images

The code will be on a sticker.

What the messages ask for

The website will ask for your payment details. It will also ask for your car details, but that is likely to be just an attempt to convince you it is a legitimate parking website.

You may later get a call from someone pretending to be from your bank who will use the information you have given and tell you that you have been defrauded and need to move your money to a safe account. The safe account is actually in the control of the scammers. Do not do as they ask – your real bank would never request this.

What to do

Be suspicious of any QR code on a parking payment machine or signpost in a car park. Check that it has not been stuck over a legitimate code.

If you have the right parking app already on your phone, use that rather than scanning a code.

Use cash or a card to pay at a machine if those are an option.

Check the URL of the website before you click on it – it should appear on your phone as you scan the code. Do not click on it if it looks suspicious.

When you land on a page through a QR code, check details to make sure it is not a fraudulent version. Giveaways include weird URLs and bad spelling. Check that the URL includes HTTPS, rather than HTTP, before handing over details.

Keep an eye on your bank account and report any suspicious payments to your bank.

Report the scam to the local council, police and car park owner if it is a private company.

It brought dinosaurs stomping and roaring into the sitting rooms of millions of viewers. Now, 25 years after the series first aired, a new, updated Walking With Dinosaurs is back on the BBC this weekend.

In the intervening years, science has not stood still. About 50 species have been discovered each year since 1999 and the advent of powerful imaging techniques and digital reconstruction have led to major advances in our understanding of what dinosaurs looked like and how they lived. Here are some of the biggest developments.

Feathered dinosaurs

By the 1990s, a handful of feathered dinosaur fossils had been identified but they were not well preserved and their wider significance remained unclear.

“The public wasn’t ready for it,” said Dr Dave Hone, a palaeontologist at Queen Mary, University of London. “Now we’re at the point where we’ve got dozens of species definitively feathered and probably a hundred plus where we’re very confident they had feathers because all their relatives do. That pushes feathers right down the family tree, which is a pretty big shift.”

Feathers matter, not only in terms of appearance, but they have added weight to the argument that some dinosaurs were warm-blooded and shape our understanding of dinosaur behaviour and evolution.

“Undoubtedly the most surprising discovery regarding dinosaurs in the last 25 years has been the discovery of the feathered dinosaurs in Liaoning province in China, and the realisation that many of the theropod dinosaurs at least had a covering of feathers and not reptilian scales,” said Dr John Nudds, a senior lecturer in palaeontology at the University of Manchester.

“These were probably initially for insulation of eggs, possibly also for display, and were later modified for flight. This has proved beyond reasonable doubt that birds evolved from dinosaurs and in fact are dinosaurs.

Arctic dinosaurs

Picture a Jurassic landscape and you’re probably thinking of a jungle with a few simmering volcanoes in the background. But scientists now believe that dinosaurs lived in much more varied climates, including in the planet’s coldest extremes.

The recent analysis of hundreds of fossils, including those of baby dinosaurs, recovered from northern Alaska suggests that they reproduced in the region and that was probably their permanent home rather than a stop on a seasonal migratory route. The region would have been plummeted into darkness for four months of the year and experienced temperatures well below freezing.

Weird, big, new species

T-rex, diplodocus, stegosaurus: the top trumps of the dinosaur kingdom have remained unchanged in popular imagination for decades. But no shortage of unique and charismatic species have been unearthed in the past 25 years, many of which palaeontologists would like to see brought to wider attention.

“One of the weirdest ones is deinocheirus,” said Prof Paul Barrett, a palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum in London. The species had been tentatively identified based on the discovery of a gigantic pair of arms in the 1960s, but it was only in 2014 when a pair of more complete skeletons were described that its unusual features came into full focus.

“It looks like the offspring of a night of passion between a radiator and a duck,” said Barrett. “It’s got a duck-like head, a huge sail on its back, sideways claws, it looks like it has been put together by a committee.”

“Absolutely staggering numbers of new species have been found,” said Hone, citing Yi qi, a feathered gliding dinosaur, as a personal favourite. “It’s basically a hybrid of a bird and a flying squirrel,” he said.

Discoveries during the past two decades have also seen larger-than-ever species unearthed. Patagotitan (announced in 2014) has an estimated length of 37 metres and estimated weight of 69 tonnes, taking the title for largest known land animal, and Dreadnoughtus (unearthed in 2005) also lives up to its battleship-scale physique.

“Some of these things are pushing 60-70 tonnes in weight,” said Barrett. “We’re having to figure out the challenges they would’ve faced moving around and eating.”

Dinosaurs taking to the seas

As old dinosaur debates have been set to rest, new ones have unfolded. The discovery of a series of spinosaurus fossils has opened up new battleground over whether these dinosaurs may have been adapted to living and hunting in the water. Dinosaurs have previously been assumed to only live and hunt on land (plesiosaurs and pliosaurs are marine reptiles, not dinosaurs).

“The big question is was it a pursuit predator? Or did it hunt like an enormous heron and grab fish with its mouth?” said Dr Jeremy Lockwood, a GP-turned-palaeontologist based on the Isle of Wight who discovered a relevant specimen nicknamed “the horned crocodile-faced hell heron”. “It’s a furious controversy that’s livened up the world of palaeontology.”

At 15-metre snout to tail, spinosaurus is longer than any other meat-eating dinosaur, has conical teeth like those seen in crocodiles, a long newt-like tail and dense bones that might help it sink in order to swim underwater.

Computer simulations have raised questions about its hydrodynamic properties, however, with one suggesting it would have rolled over on its side when submerged, according to Lockwood. “I can see both points of view but I wouldn’t dream of settling on one,” he said.

Among the most important discoveries of the past decade is that of soft-shelled eggs, complete with fossilised embryos, as old as 200m years. “All the eggs we’d had until then were like hen eggs,” said Hone. The latest evidence suggests that many dinosaur species laid soft-shelled eggs, something like those laid by lizards or crocodiles today.

Even more intriguingly, analysis of the teeth of embryos within some of the eggs, suggests that they gestated for up to six months. This opens up a new vista on the reproductive lives of dinosaurs, suggesting that they may have buried eggs in nests or burrows.

“Are they looking after a nest for months at a time? Or digging a hole and buggering off and coming back a year later to see if their babies have hatched?” said Hone. “All of the options are really weird.”

It brought dinosaurs stomping and roaring into the sitting rooms of millions of viewers. Now, 25 years after the series first aired, a new, updated Walking With Dinosaurs is back on the BBC this weekend.

In the intervening years, science has not stood still. About 50 species have been discovered each year since 1999 and the advent of powerful imaging techniques and digital reconstruction have led to major advances in our understanding of what dinosaurs looked like and how they lived. Here are some of the biggest developments.

Feathered dinosaurs

By the 1990s, a handful of feathered dinosaur fossils had been identified but they were not well preserved and their wider significance remained unclear.

“The public wasn’t ready for it,” said Dr Dave Hone, a palaeontologist at Queen Mary, University of London. “Now we’re at the point where we’ve got dozens of species definitively feathered and probably a hundred plus where we’re very confident they had feathers because all their relatives do. That pushes feathers right down the family tree, which is a pretty big shift.”

Feathers matter, not only in terms of appearance, but they have added weight to the argument that some dinosaurs were warm-blooded and shape our understanding of dinosaur behaviour and evolution.

“Undoubtedly the most surprising discovery regarding dinosaurs in the last 25 years has been the discovery of the feathered dinosaurs in Liaoning province in China, and the realisation that many of the theropod dinosaurs at least had a covering of feathers and not reptilian scales,” said Dr John Nudds, a senior lecturer in palaeontology at the University of Manchester.

“These were probably initially for insulation of eggs, possibly also for display, and were later modified for flight. This has proved beyond reasonable doubt that birds evolved from dinosaurs and in fact are dinosaurs.

Arctic dinosaurs

Picture a Jurassic landscape and you’re probably thinking of a jungle with a few simmering volcanoes in the background. But scientists now believe that dinosaurs lived in much more varied climates, including in the planet’s coldest extremes.

The recent analysis of hundreds of fossils, including those of baby dinosaurs, recovered from northern Alaska suggests that they reproduced in the region and that was probably their permanent home rather than a stop on a seasonal migratory route. The region would have been plummeted into darkness for four months of the year and experienced temperatures well below freezing.

I look back at the last day of our old life with a kind of wonder now: the million summer freedoms, the complacency of our ease.

I watched the cricket with Max on my knee. Friends came to visit, and Ruth fed Max while we talked about our new neighbourhood among piles of books and packing boxes. Max gurgled regally as I changed one of his famous nappies. I organised our phone chargers and put his birth certificate carefully in a drawer with our passports and the mortgage statement. Then I hung a picture in what would soon be his room: a print from Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are, of a little boy sailing bravely across the ocean, with “Max” emblazoned on the prow of his ship. I stood back and admired it, feeling all three of us to be limitless, and wondering what would happen next.

Ruth called her mum and gave her the latest; I told one group chat I thought Ring doorbells were for dickheads, and asked another what had been happening at work during my paternity leave. I ate half a chocolate bar, then forgot about it. Finding it a week later levelled me. This melted Dairy Milk, left for me by another person entirely, a stranger from an antique land.

Then I have an in-between memory. I woke at five and stumbled to the bathroom to drink from the tap. The house was silent. Maybe the unknowable internal dominoes had already started to fall, or maybe they could still have been stopped. Maybe I could have decided to get Max up early, for no particular reason. Gina, the night nanny helping us through the move, would have thought me strange, but it would have been fine. Or if I had picked him up for a cuddle and put him straight back. Or if changing any single moment in his life or mine might have made everything different. A different bedtime. A different bed. A different house. A different dad.

Just before six, the day already too hot, the pallid dawn creeping around the blinds: Gina’s voice, bursting into our room, screaming, blurred by a dream. I don’t remember her words. She is holding Max towards us, maybe hoping we will say she is wrong and he is fine. But he has no pulse, and he is not breathing. He is limp, cold, the colour of marble.

Then I am calling 999 for the first time in my life while Gina starts CPR. I am saying our address again and again, begging the operator to start telling us what to do. I am distractingly aware that I am naked in the presence of someone I hardly know. Now Ruth takes the phone, and under the operator’s instructions we move Max from the bed to the floor. Now Ruth calls out a rhythm while I press at his little chest with my clumsy thumbs, then pause for Gina to breathe into his mouth.

There is a voice in my head. You and Gina should not be dividing this responsibility, it says. You have introduced a layer of confusion. You should have taken charge. These are the things you have to get right at the most important moment of your life. This is happening. You are his father. This is your job. These will always be the things that you did. You are failing, and now your son is dead. “Please, please,” I say, sobbing as I count. All three of us are saying it. “Please, Max, please.”

A police car is nearby, and they arrive a few minutes after six. Ruth runs down to let them in, I think. We stagger dumbly back, and let someone lead us out of the room.

We are told to ride with him in the back of the ambulance because there is every chance he will not survive the journey

Max is still on the floor when the paramedics arrive a few minutes later, their notes tell me, but the police have done an excellent job with a defibrillator. The paramedics attach pads which adjust the shock to his size. He has no pulse. They push a tube down his throat to stop his tongue from blocking his airway. Then they put a bag over his nose and mouth which forces air into his lungs. Max is gasping once or twice a minute. But his heart starts beating again.

At six minutes to seven, we leave for the hospital. At some point I must have found some clothes. I sit in the front of the ambulance and say thank you to the driver. When we get there, a paramedic tells us Max has opened his eyes. I cannot calibrate what this means. Perhaps it will be a near miss, a story we will tell.

Max is rushed past us into A&E. I haven’t really seen him in an hour, just the cloud of people and equipment that attends him. Ruth, Gina and I are taken to a cramped waiting room, full of stacked chairs. I stare at the ceiling. An insect crawls along a fluorescent light.

We are accompanied by a placid hospital staffer who keeps offering us cups of tea. Two police officers join us, and before we get any update on how Max is doing, they ask us for an account of what happened. Gina is talking a lot, I guess motivated by a reasonable horror of getting the blame, explaining that she had noticed the silence in place of his usual snuffling and stirring, but that she did not know how long it had been. Ruth and I barely speak, but I understand that all three of us are yet to be eliminated from their inquiries.

We try to go to him, but are kept at a terrifying distance. Instead, we make a series of calls that irreversibly write our private crisis into the world at large. I know, as I hear my mother pick up, that I am about to compel her to enter one of the worst experiences of her life.

Eventually, a doctor comes to see us. Max’s blood pressure is stable. But he has had to be sedated so that a mechanical ventilator can be pushed down his throat. He has a very poor blood oxygen saturation level of below 60%. One possibility is a heart and lung machine, which will do the work on his behalf.

I think I have heard most babies who need this do not survive. The doctor’s gloss is the first of many annihilating euphemisms in the weeks ahead. “This is basically an end therapy,” she says. “It is the most we can do.”

Whether this is ultimately necessary or not, Max must be moved to a specialist hospital at once. Another doctor from the acute transportation team comes in to explain. He is likely to have suffered a brain injury, and he is in a kind of induced coma. We should ride with him in the back of the ambulance, she says, because there is every chance he will not survive the journey. That was her phrase: every chance.

We say goodbye to Gina, and I hear myself tell her that none of this is her fault, that she saved his life. We climb into the ambulance and huddle around our boy, seeing him for the first time as a patient, grotesquely encumbered with wires and tubes. I sob again at the sight of his funny little face. The sirens sound different from inside, the speed feels nothing like fast enough.

Ruth saves me from despair. She tells me we will take it in turns to tell Max a reason we love him. We lean very close and revive each other with his myriad idiosyncrasies, a litany of his infinite seven-week-old self. I feel that if we stop, he will go. In this way, we cross London to Great Ormond Street.

I’ve thought a lot about why I’m writing this. I know that I’m repelled by the kind of spiritual vultures who might scour Max’s story for shareable aphorisms, and that ideally, I’d like to slap them with an injunction. On the other hand, I also know that what happened has changed me utterly, and confronted me with things about the world that I had never even tried to understand: how unbelievably precarious it all is, the breadth of what constitutes a meaningful life, and the medieval state of anxiety that the disabled world still produces in the typical one. I hate the way that disabled lives recede out of view because other people are too squeamish to talk about them, and I want to confront that tendency. Mostly, though, I think Max is already a thousand times more interesting than anyone I’ve ever met, and I want to tell you about him.

The three of us are only in the foothills of what I now understand to be our real life

As an advance on the parts of his story that are much less of an intergalactic bummer, I should tell you the first thing that really made me laugh. A few days after we arrived at Great Ormond Street hospital, some extremely nice friends sent us balloon letters spelling out Max’s name. When my friend Lizzie and I went to collect them, we found a harassed driver trying to wrestle them out of his van on a double yellow line.

“I hate delivering here,” he observed, scanning the street for ambulances and traffic wardens somehow left cold by his generosity of spirit. “I’ve got kids. What’s he in for? It’s always bad news!” He continued in this vein for a bit, the letters X A M bouncing against his idiotic ears, until Lizzie put her hand up to interrupt. “Sorry,” she said, “but are you not the stripper?” So that was a bright spot. When I say our mood had already lifted a little, you have to understand that our perception of what counted as good news had changed radically.

On day one, a police officer hovered at the entrance to Seahorse ward, as the paediatric intensive care unit is more palatably known, lest we try to finish the job we were still under suspicion of having started. Before we were allowed to see Max, we sat through half an hour of mollycoddling in a faded waiting area. Nothing sounded true until the doctor said, “It is likely there has been an insult to the brain.” I was brought up short by the term, which seemed to carry the right note of reasonless cruelty. I wasn’t wearing any socks, I now noticed, and my feet stuck to the coarse fabric of my shoes.

Then, at last: there he was. He had a blue tube going into his right nostril, and a white tube coming out of his left one. Two others came out of his mouth, fixed in place by medical tape. Medical equipment towered over him, and he lay under a cooling blanket, very small and still, at the top of a bed that might have fit 10 of him.

On day two, we were brought away from his bedside for an update from the neurologist in another dismal meeting room. The doctor took us through the results of an electroencephalogram (EEG), a relatively crude measure of brain activity, and a CT scan. “There appears to be damage to the brain stem,” he said.

Then he said we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that Max had lost the ability to breathe on his own, and consciousness itself. The 1,746 pages of medical notes I got from the hospital later are mostly impenetrable, but two routine words, in a direct message to a colleague from a consultant who had seen the EEG, will never leave me: “Oh well.”

The next day they brought us back for another debrief, this time on an MRI scan, which would provide a more precise view. “We can see damage to the cerebral cortex, and swelling to the basal ganglia, which is the part of the brain that controls language and movement,” the doctor said. “That could mean epilepsy and seizures. As he gets older we would look for signs of cerebral palsy. And we don’t know how the injury has impacted his ability to speak, or to swallow safely.”

We stared at a cross-section of Max’s brain. The doctor went on, “What we can also see now is that there is no damage to the brain stem.” He held his hands out as if describing a fish, emphasising what he said next with first the left, then the right. “Where before we were thinking about severe damage, we would now put it at moderate to severe.” Good news. Trying not to let hope in, I groped for the right language: what does that mean about consciousness? About his self, about his soul? “There are other parts of the brain that affect cognition,” he said, correcting my terminology. “It’s wait and see. But he’s starting to trigger his own breath, and that’s a positive sign.”

We went back to our place next to Max, and distributed the news to our families, stationed at hotels and coffee shops nearby in anticipation of their allotted hour at his side. Then we sat quietly and watched the nurses as they went about their comforting business. I said the same thing to myself again and again: no better time to be Max in the history of the human race. No better place to be Max than exactly where he is.

Sometimes his eyes flickered open, but we had been warned that this was not a sign of awareness. Ruth and I read to him, and stroked his forehead and ears. He was very far away, and it seemed impossible that he would ever grumble and belch in our arms again.

But Max started to breathe on his own, and to produce great hacking coughs – a horrible and blessed sound that suggested his gag reflex, crucial to eating safely, was unimpaired. On the fourth day, they started to warm him up. At some indeterminate point, he was awake. Now he seemed to look at us, and to complain, if not to cry. We couldn’t hold him yet, but Ruth gave him her milk through a tube, transfiguring a process of medicinal sterility into an act of maternal love. And I read to him again, wondering if he could hear, or if we would tell him about this one day.

I told him the story of his intrepid namesake, who sailed away to a terrifying and seductive place, and found his way home. It feels corny to tell you this because it’s so implausibly on the nose, but I suppose I no longer believe that anything is sentimental if it is true. I brought the book close enough to show him the pictures, and read:

And Max the king of all wild things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all.

So he gave up being king of where the wild things are.

But the wild things cried, “Oh please don’t go -

we’ll eat you up – we love you so!”

And Max said, “No!”

Over the next couple of weeks, Max underwent heart tests, lung tests, metabolic tests, genetic tests. Nothing showed up on any of them. Meanwhile, the police left the scene of what they eventually determined was not a crime. “We’re probably never going to know definitively what happened,” a consultant said. “Our best guess is it was a case of Sids [sudden infant death syndrome] interrupted,” an event so rare that there are no meaningful statistics pointing to its frequency. I wanted to know if this was ordained before Max was born, and could therefore be recognised as a part of him; or if it might not have happened, a far more horrifying prospect. But nobody can tell you those things, either.

I had been thinking a lot about Gina, dwelling in my unsilenceable sense that although this wasn’t her fault, the decision to outsource some of our parenting meant that it must be mine. The truth is that I am ashamed, and I know that this feeling will never completely leave me. But being told that Max’s injury appeared to be the result of something beyond anyone’s control at least muted that reproachful voice a little.

Even so, what befell Max quickly came to feel like some merciless cosmic rebalancing. I have had every kind of luck in life, cascading from the accident of my birth to sane, well-off parents to my education, my job, my friends, meeting Ruth, and then the joy of Max’s arrival. My dad died, and it was terrible, but that is supposed to happen. At some point, I think I just assumed that I was going to get out intact.

Over our time at Great Ormond Street, I developed a warped, concentric taxonomy. At the very centre were Max and Ruth, who could have anything they wanted. Then came the other kids we met, and their families; then the doctors and nurses and porters and volunteers. I could usually get from the bedside to the front entrance and feel wrapped in a spirit of mutual benevolence. If one of those people had taken a piss on my shoes, I would have shrugged and put it down to nervous exhaustion.

The street outside was a mixed zone; balloon merchants and Uber drivers might not have felt the weight of our catastrophe, but at least they had collided with it. Beyond that, I quickly felt that I needed body armour or, ideally, a baseball bat with nails in it. Nobody here knows fucking anything, I wrote in a note to myself, perhaps unfairly assuming that these people were floating through life as I had for the last 39 years. Late one night, a drunk teenager planted himself in front of me on the pavement, asked for the time, and told me to lighten up. I worked through alarming visions of beating him senseless all the way back to our room.

The whole world seemed decadent. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg negotiated the terms of a cage fight; disgruntled holidaymakers told the newspapers of their anger about an air traffic control problem that left them “marooned”. Meanwhile, I asked the neurologist if I could be right in my conviction that Max had looked at me. As she answered, she picked up a stuffed animal and thrust it suddenly at his face. He didn’t flinch.

But then, after we got him home, an August day commemorated by exclamation marks in my notes: sitting in his bouncer, Max contemplated a rattle being waved maniacally in front of his face, and smiled. When I flashed the rattle towards him, he blinked in surprise: his impassive response of a week earlier, it turned out, was no more than the artefact of a colossal opioid hangover. I felt forgiven for every shitty thing I’d ever done. For the first time, we let ourselves believe that Max was here, and that he would not be going away.

The diagnosis won’t be formally confirmed until he’s two years old, but in early 2024, we were told Max has cerebral palsy: that is, parts of his brain that should route instructions to his muscles had been permanently injured by the loss of oxygen when his heart stopped.

At first, they told us to be optimistic that Max would eventually walk and talk. On the five-point Gross Motor Function Classification System, where five denotes the most severe physical impairment, an assessment suggested he was almost certainly somewhere between level one and level three. “The difference between one to three and four to five is very significant,” one doctor said. “So that’s really good news.”

But over time, it became clear that this lifeline had been thrown without any firm attachment at the other end. Max is nearly two now. It is still too early to reach any firm conclusions about cognition, although there are only good signs in the way he peers after someone when they leave, and laughs at peekaboo, and gets excited when he sees his milk bottle. He has so far been spared seizures or the need to be fed through a tube into his stomach, which are very significant pieces of good fortune. But on that early prediction, our hopes have been gradually distilled: from walking and talking to mobility and communication. From as “normal” a life as possible to as good a life as possible. And from independence, and doing everything for himself, to a more expansive definition of freedom.

It’s not that Max is a slow learner: it’s that he has so much more to learn. Where other kids seek a driving licence, he is tasked with the invention of the internal combustion engine. When his attention is elsewhere or he is asleep, he will move a limb with heartbreaking ease, but when he tries to do something, the signal gets scrambled. He makes a range of entertaining sounds to indicate his opinions, but the muscles in his mouth resist any instruction to form a consonant; he doesn’t roll from his front to his back much, or sit up without support, and he struggles to pick up objects or release them from his grasp. On that five-point motor function scale, we now think he’s probably a four. There’s a lot we can do to help Max, but we aren’t going to change that fundamental reality.

The word we kept hearing was “neuroplasticity”: the idea that the brain may be able to somewhat adapt to an injury, and forge new pathways for the blocked instructions, if given the chance through repetition. The potential for those changes is greatest in the first couple of years, so we felt hopeful, but also under intense pressure to do as much physiotherapy as possible.

For a while, we were overwhelmed. People would remind us, in case we didn’t realise, that we should be sure to make sure to be Max’s parents as well as his carers, something that’s a lot easier to say when your kid somersaults out of bed and plays the Fisher-Price xylophone like Evelyn Glennie. But gradually, things got better. The main reason for that is Ruth.

It’s a funny thing: you fall in love with a beautiful Canadian smartarse for her ability to make you collapse in laughter by enumerating your manifold flaws, and she turns out to be an indomitable hero. Ruth’s greatest peacetime virtues map neatly on to the job description for a top-tier parent to a kid with a disability: her fearlessness is now directed at intransigent bureaucrats instead of difficult landlords, her unwavering loyalty now applies to Max as well as her oldest friends, and her boggling adaptability now means that, as well as figuring out life on a new continent, she can sketch out your shared place in a totally different world.

I’m also not sure what we would have done without Rachel, a nanny and carer who has Coca-Cola for breakfast and uncooperative healthcare practitioners for lunch. Rachel, who dresses mostly in black, hates our dog and gets to work on an extremely illegal scooter, has worked with kids with disabilities for many years, and she’s seen plenty of things that make our situation look like a breeze. She is tough as tungsten, devoted to Max, and very good at physiotherapy routines.

Which is lucky, because there are a lot of them. Poor old Max: where most parents are cooing at their indolent progeny as they chuck another bowl of mashed banana on the floor, or dumping them on the rug with a pile of bricks and the vague instruction to follow their instinct, we were coaching him through a regime of baby sit-ups and commando rolls that brought to mind swelling trumpets and a young Sylvester Stallone.

I worry we are guilty of trying to ‘fix’ Max and feel queasy about all the things we can afford that others can’t

In the early days, we considered several treatments that turned out to be ludicrous quackery. Now, alongside the mostly excellent NHS services we are granted by our postcode, we swaddle Max in intricate orthotic straps supposed to help with his alignment and proprioception, and stick little electrodes to his spine and glutes. We use up half our holiday to attend physiotherapy “intensives” that run for weeks at a time. Most of the rest last year went on trips to North Carolina, where Ruth got him on to a world-leading stem cell trial at Duke University. Max has spent a thrilling couple of months trying out an eye-tracking communication tablet, or Eyegaze, and taken to it with such magical ease that we hope the NHS will cover the brutal cost of getting him one permanently; we stick little laminated symbols to a board – “Eat”, “Drink”, “More”, “Finished” – to provide an analogue alternative in the meantime. Our house now resembles a steampunk scrapyard, full of industrial-looking equipment that helps Max in one way or another.

Nothing amounts to a miracle cure. I worry that we are guilty of trying to “fix” Max, and I feel queasy when I think about all the things we can afford to do that so many parents like us simply cannot. Max seems to be making real progress, but we are doing so many things at once that we have only a hazy sense of what helps and what doesn’t. Making him a one-baby randomised control trial would be more rigorous, but he would be past his period of maximum gain by the time we understood what was really worthwhile. I often think of that old marketing saw: “Half my advertising spend is wasted. The difficulty is I don’t know which half.”

I am telling you all this in part, I must admit to myself, because I don’t want your vision of me as a parent to be only that of the man who paid someone to feed his son in the night. And this, then, too: on our last day at the local hospital, an A&E doctor told us that when she heard what had happened, she could not understand how Max had made it in with a fighting chance. That she thought about us and Gina with admiration all the time, and that the three of us had undoubtedly saved his life, saved his life, saved his life.

Nobody knew exactly what to say, and a few people just drifted out of sight. A surprisingly large number of others concluded that the comforting thing to do was to draw a comparison between their own offspring’s minor ailments and what happened to Max. We heard about skin conditions, joint problems, minor bouts of jaundice, and an asthmatic who later went to university, which also happens to be my own tale of triumph over adversity. In one memorable case, someone told me about a toddler who carried the burden of a squint that ultimately resolved on its own. My son is a heavily sedated two-month-old and he still reads the room better than you, is what I later wished I had had the presence of mind to say in reply.

The line I hated the most, blandly repeated whenever someone couldn’t think of what to say, was that it must have been “scary”, as if we’d lost him in the supermarket. I cultivated a sense of grievance about these absolute doughnuts, who made me feel like a woman on a terrible Hinge date: just ask me some questions! Their clucking seemed to be a way of pulling their own coat tighter against the storm, instead of offering it to us.

In my head, London was full of rubbernecking acquaintances thinking mostly about how lucky they were, and eliciting lurid details about our mental collapse from the people who cared enough to come and see us. I liked to speculate to Ruth about how they were spending their evenings. Life is so precious – hold them close tonight, these fictional villains were texting their group chats, before turning back to their takeout and Grand Designs, or drafting another Instagram story going out to all the new parents finding it so tough: You’ve got this!!! I wanted to tell them we viewed their version of parenthood, their challenges with nap schedules and self-weaning, with the same righteous condescension as they viewed people who didn’t have kids. I wanted their children to be eaten by lions, despite the pastel anti-lion cages they had installed around their beds.

I don’t feel that way any more. The truth is that it was very hard to say the right thing to me last year. People’s thudding comparisons to their own robust brats were, above all, pretty funny. A squint, come on. I partly held on to them because they gave me something to fulminate about to the people I was really intimate with, not because they had done us any harm.

I wish, now, that I had spent more time reckoning with the devotion of the people who loved us, all the more bewildering because I was so bad at asking for it. Our families’ sustaining presence at our sides; the dozens of people who signed up for a meal train that lasted 64 days and only stopped because everyone agreed I was getting alarmingly fat; the friends who took on deadening logistical roles, unpacked our house for us, and just would not bloody leave us in peace. I will never forget finishing lunch at a friend’s and realising that one of our hosts had taken Max to the next room, where I found him companionably installed in front of Mr Tumble with the other kids, wholly included without any special effort on our part for the first time. Or hearing second-hand about Ruth’s best friend finding a toy figurine in a wheelchair to normalise Max’s likely future for her own son, a bridge that she built without ever telling us herself. None of it could really help, in one sense. But it made it impossible to persist in my conviction that we were utterly alone.

In the first few months, the fact of Max’s injury mostly had to be taken on faith. I’d never really spent much time around babies before, and everything he did looked perfect to me. I enjoyed the way friends who were anxious not to seem like they were scrutinising him for flaws traduced their own children for our benefit, too. I’m so sorry about Norman, they’d say, unprompted: he’d eat his own shit if he wasn’t too stupid to know where his arse is, he’s pond scum, he’s pathetic, he should be in a secure facility.

Gradually, though, the impact became unignorable. Kids with cerebral palsy often have a lot of trouble in the midline, the central zone where so many of life’s vital activities take place: to hold a toy proffered beneath his eyes, Max would extend his arms to their widest wingspan, then inch one hand gradually towards the centre, saying OOOH as he went, until you met him with the prize halfway. I always thought of 2001’s shuttle, docking with a space station to the strains of a Johann Strauss waltz. There was such charm and determination in the way he worked against the grain of his disobliging neural pathways: I knew this wasn’t how it usually worked, but the effect was much too lovely to feel altogether sad.

By last summer, we thought we were robust enough to go away for a few days with friends whose son had arrived around the same time as Max. Timmy was a sweet little guy, and as it turned out I resented him deeply, in the way you resent the Maldives sunset your friend posts on social media while you sit at your desk.

One morning, as I gave Max breakfast in his supportive chair, Timmy staggered into the kitchen holding a plastic bottle, dropped it, picked it up again, laboriously unscrewed the lid and put it in his mouth, picked up a piece of cutlery from the floor and tapped it on the table. I tried to count the little gifts of information about the workings of the world that this short drunkard would have taken from that sequence, and found myself crying quietly. I wanted to shout for everyone else to gather round, in the way you do when a showy closeup magician presents himself at a wedding: Gordon, get over here! You’ve got to see what this kid can do with a spoon!

We can’t invent hope. But we can find a way to live without faking it, to forge something good out of this anger, and this love

As a white man named Archibald, I always suspected I was missing something about the impact of privilege; now it became viscerally clear. In the autumn, as we continued our dutiful re-entry to the world, a friend listened attentively to an update on Max’s progress and then, after the conversation had moved on, drifted into a paean to the pleasures of later childhood. His own son was reaching the age where they can happily wander to school on their own, he said dreamily. I suppose he had no inkling, as I smiled through his description of independence as an indispensable part of being a fully realised person, that the only thought in my head was how that would never be the case for Max.

On one of those trips to North Carolina, we waited at the boarding gate, showing Max a video on Ruth’s phone. A sweet old lady came over and complimented us, correctly, on how handsome Max was; then she asked whether we ought to be showing him television at his age, reminded us how important these years were for his development, and went back to her seat.

As we waited for the flight to board, and muttered to each other about how totally she could go and fuck herself, I felt an unprecedented compulsion to do something. I rehearsed what I wanted to say with Ruth a couple of times, and then went and found her.

“Hi, sorry, I just wanted to mention something,” I gabbled. “It’s just to say our son spends more time with a screen than other babies because he has a disability that makes it very difficult to play with toys. So maybe if you see someone parenting in a way you don’t approve of, you should think about what else might be going on.”

She looked a bit stricken and said, “No, dear” twice, and I went back to my seat, trembling with the thrill of it. “He has a disability”: I had never said that to a stranger before. Max took a giant shit, and burped beatifically. Then an English guy in a gilet loudly called his pimpled son a “fucking retard”, and I stared furiously at my shoes.

A few weeks ago, during the usual battle of wills over dinner, Max did something very surprising. I reloaded the spoon, and he did it again, so I put my camera on, and asked Ruth to come over and give an opinion. We offered him another chance to accept a bit of dinner and, as he often does, he puckered his lips and turned away. Then, in something like desperation as I chased him with shepherd’s pie, he put his tongue to the roof of his mouth, and the great wail that followed started with a consonant. Ruth burst out laughing. I turned to the camera, triumphant and beseeching. “Come on!” I said. “That’s definitely ‘No’!”

Everyone I sent it to enthusiastically agreed. I floated around for a few days on the strength of it. Since then, though, the incident has drifted out of view. Max communicates, loudly, all the time, but I can’t honestly say that anything since has engendered the same confidence that he’s deliberately forming a consonant. Maybe we projected the whole thing. What’s surprising is how I feel about it. If you had explained this sequence to me a year ago, I think I would have sunk into despair. Today, the honest truth is that whether this turns out to be a first step or a false dawn, I simply do not care.

Versions of the same question come up a lot in the accounts I have read from people with disabilities and their parents: would you undo it? In one sense, it’s an idiotic query, as relevant to reality as the matter of who would win in a fight between 100 duck-sized horses and one horse-sized duck. But it is hard to put away.

I don’t mean to be glib. If I could press a button that made Max’s life easier by granting him everything he has been denied, I would do it in a second. But if the question is whether I would take myself back to being the genial ignoramus of two years ago, I’m much less sure. I wish this had never happened, of course. But life would feel thin without it. I understand things about myself and the world now that I can’t wish I didn’t know. All of the noise about what on earth I’m here for has melted away. I think I am a better person, if a sadder one.

The realisation that brings clarity is this: the more time passes, the more the hypothetical about undoing it becomes an invitation to wish Max away, to erase all the things that I love about him. When I watch him using his Eyegaze with such cheerful skill, I get so carbonated with pride that I feel like I’m having a panic attack. If Max never speaks, that isn’t frightening any more; if he ends up turning out tongue twisters, I’m curious to see what that’s like, too.

I don’t remember the recitation Ruth and I made on that ambulance ride, to be honest, but I can supply a new version in a second. The YIKES grimace he pulls when he’s at the apex of his arc on a swing and absolutely unsure about whether this is a good idea. The high kicking glee of a few minutes in his walker. His Godzilla thirst for trampling on my face if I hold him in the air. His turds, somehow. His amazement when he realised it was the button he was pressing that made the plastic frog burp bubbles. The warm weight of him in my arms as I rock him to sleep, and the way he gazes at me when I sing him a song. When I think about my question at Great Ormond Street now, I think I was right not to ask about cognition: that his personhood is not subject to medical assessment. And that Max was the boy who went away, but he is also, thank God, the boy who came back.

There was a time when choosing this Max over some theoretical other felt like a betrayal: I had a recurring idea of this other possible boy, stuck in limbo, wondering why I had abandoned him. He still comes to me, sometimes. But there is nothing at all apart from the things that happen. To ask if I would undo it is to ask if I want some other kid. I don’t. I want this one. And so I have to let that figment go.

Sometimes, people tell us to hold on to hope, or to believe in Max. But those invitations miss the point completely. We don’t have to believe in Max, because he’s right in front of us, farting. We can’t invent hope. But we can find a way to live without faking it, to forge something good out of this anger, and this love. In that determination, we can create the fertile soil for hope to take root when it decides to arrive.

It is too soon to say if this feeling is the beginnings of a philosophy, or a fantasy. The three of us are only in the foothills of what I now understand to be our real life. How long until we have to leave our three-floor terraced house? How will our backs cope as Max grows? How will it feel as his disability becomes more visible to others, and as he starts to understand it himself? Will he want to live with us or move out one day? And what happens when we die?

To this list of mine, Max will add a thousand questions of his own. The answers to all of them will certainly come. In the meantime, he and Ruth are downstairs, engaged in a lively discussion about what’s for dinner. That is the next question, and I want to help them answer it.

Some names have been changed.

Folk music is having a resurgence in Norway spurred by a reclamation of the genre among generation Z.

Norwegian folk music, which until recently was largely restricted to the countryside, has been gaining traction across Norwegian cities with sweaty club nights appealing to a younger audience.

Playing a central role in the revival is Tuvas Blodklubb, a monthly event at Riksscenen, the national centre for traditional folk music and dance in Oslo, which attracts hundreds of people every month and tours around the country. Similar folk music clubs have since started in other cities including Bergen, Trondheim and Tromsø.

Musician Tuva Syvertsen started Tuvas Blodklubb, which she describes as “Norway’s, probably the Nordic region’s, and maybe even the world’s first pure folk music nightclub”, seven years ago with the aim of opening up the kinds of experiences she was having at folk music festivals to more people, particularly among the LGBTQ+ community.

Inspired by Oslo’s techno music scene, she wanted to make folk music less “stiff” and create an event that attracted younger people. “I wanted to have a place that you could go and get wasted and dance to folk music on a Saturday,” said Syvertsen, 41, who is in the band Valkyrien Allstars. “So that’s what we did.”

Part of its gen Z appeal, she believes, is the sense of rootedness it offers in an uncertain world. “Young people feel that the world is unsteady as it is and they seek something real, something warm and close to them. So maybe that has something to do with it,” she said.

Norwegian folk music, which dates back hundreds of years, is played using traditional instruments including Norway’s national instrument, hardingfele (the hardanger fiddle), bukkehorn (an instrument made from a goat’s horn) and langeleik (a stringed instrument similar to a dulcimer).

The Sámi vocal tradition of joiking, which for a long time was banned in schools as a result of racist assimilation policies by the Norwegian government, is also being revitalised by younger generations and artists such as Marja Mortensson, 30, gaining mainstream recognition.

The Sámi people are the Indigenous population of Sápmi, a region covering northern Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden, who have been subjected to widespread discrimination.

“As long as you know the tradition it’s very important that joiking also lives in popular music or where young people listen to music because that’s how traditional music will live on and be passed on to younger generations,” she said.

It is especially important, she added, to have spaces for traditions to live where people can be exposed to traditional folk music. “It gives you some kind of strength to know your own music tradition,” she said.

Dance is a big part of the Tuvas Blodklubb nights. Before each club night, Syvertsen puts on sessions to teach people the basics beforehand, which she said are also “packed with young people that want to learn”.

Many young clubbers, she said, are not used to dancing to live music, but with folk music the interplay between musician and dancer is key.

“An actual person sitting there playing for you, that is way different to dancing to a DJ. It’s much more sensitive. Not on the dance itself but in the chemistry between the dancers and the musicians, that’s really essential.”

As well as booking live performers and DJs from around the world, she has a house DJ, DJ Sissyfus, who plays electronic music and makes remixes of old folk music recordings. Sometimes she also books singers who sing along to fiddle tunes. “We put microphones under the stage so it’s just the sound of the voice and the foot-stomping. It’s really amazing,” she said. They also have folk music karaoke sessions.

Norwegian mashups.

In the future Syvertsen hopes to take the event to cities outside of Norway such as London or Berlin. “This [club night] is extremely exotic for Norwegians, so I guess it would work just as well somewhere else,” she said.

Syvertsen, who plays the hardanger fiddle and grew up with folk music, said a big part of her own fascination comes from the power of a single instrument and its survival over so many hundreds of years. “There is something about those melodies and those stories that are so still so relevant,” she said.

It was Darren McMullen’s obsession with padel that led him to missing an audition and changing the course of his life. Known for his role as Alex Larden on House Husbands and for presenting shows such as The Voice Australia, he had increasingly been sucked into padel tournaments.

“My agent went crazy: ‘What were you thinking? What’s your bread and butter?’” McMullen says. “I was like, ‘God, you’re right. I should open a padel centre.’”

That was 2023; now he has three sites in Sydney and Canberra, including one in Moore Park with a sauna, ice baths and DJ decks. While Racquet Club does have pickleball courts as well, McMullen is firmly a padel man. “I think it’s the best game ever invented,” he says.

Pickleball may be one of the fastest growing sports in Australia, not least because courts are popping up in breweries. But padel is snapping at its heels. Australia is relatively late to the party, but there are now 14 padel clubs around the country, and the delirium that the sport attracts overseas, in Europe and South America in particular, is feeding the buzz over here. (Incidentally, McMullen advises you don’t poshly pronounce “padel” as “padelle”, since to do so would mark you out as someone who “goes to Barcelona once and refuses to say the name without a lisp”.)

Both padel and pickleball appeal to wannabe or retiring tennis players, since they’re less hard on the body (particularly thanks to the underarm serve) and can be played with a lower skill level, but they also attract a broader demographic because of the sociability of being doubles sports. Pickleball, originally invented as a family game, is played on an open 13.41 x 6.1m court with a plastic ball, while padel is played on a 20m x 10m glass-walled court (for squash-like returns), using a ball that’s more like a tennis ball.

The upstart sports have attracted the attention of celebrity fans, too. Team Padel includes tennis pros from Rafael Nadal to Pat Rafter, who is Padel Australia’s founding ambassador, while Lionel Messi co-owns a padel team and Cristiano Ronaldo owns clubs. Team Pickleball counts Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf (who both have signature pickleball paddles), and Billie Eilish and Coldplay have stopped by Racquet Club for a pickleball playoff.

There’s a sense of tribalism that arises from loyalty to one sport or the other. The Telegraph UK called this jousting “the battle for the new middle class favourite sport”.

“Pickleball’s a fantastic game,” McMullen says generously, “but it’s a game, not a sport.”

So which should we emotionally invest in – is this rivalry just VHS v Beta all over again, with one bound for extinction? The Guardian asked three players with skin in the game.

Which requires more skill?

Rosa Morris is a former tennis player who gave up when a shoulder injury got in the way of her overarm serve. She and a friend were trying to find unusual things to do, which led them to dragon boat racing, axe throwing and then pickleball. She now competes internationally and reached No 1 in Australia for masters. Yes, pickleball can be fun, but as Morris says “I never do anything for fun”.

“The speed of pickleball is incredible,” she says. “The ball comes rocketing at you and you’ve got to change direction very quickly. The rallies you have at the net are called fireflies or hand battles. It’s like ping-pong on steroids.”

Morris isn’t sure about padel. “I’ve watched a bit of it,” she says. “It’s crazy. They can go out of the door and play the ball and it looks like no one can ever win a point; it goes on and on.”

To this attitude, McMullen replies, “I could give my mum, who’s never played a racket sport, a pickleball paddle and she’d be able to have a back and forth.”

No matter how skilled a player is, there’s always an opportunity for injury. Rob Daley is chief operating officer of Game4Padel in Australia, which has clubs expanding across Victoria and an ambassador in Andy Murray. He also plays on the national senior men’s padel team and half-jokes that padel could become our new most dangerous sport in the same way that squash was in the 80s, when middle-aged executives suddenly started exerting themselves.

Morris admits to having “done two hammies” from the fast pivoting that pickleball requires. Geelong-based GP (and occasional pickleball player) Adrian Jury told the Guardian that he had heard radiologists were seeing an epidemic of Achilles ruptures in older players who’d had a few drinks before hitting the court.

Which is more affordable?

Depending on the site and time, Game4Padel charges $50-$80 for an hour of padel and $20 for pickleball, while Racquet Club charges $60-$100 for a hour of padel compared with $30-$50 for pickleball. “When you take into consideration that each padel court costs $100,000, we spend close to $2m fitting out a warehouse, and our rent is close to a million dollars a year, I would say it’s quite reasonable,” McMullen says.

By contrast, Pickleball courts often get marked out on existing volleyball, badminton and indoor soccer courts, making them much cheaper. “The lines get freaking confusing,” says Morris, who prefers to travel 90 minutes to use a $50-an-hour purpose-built court.

Which is likely to make it to the Olympics first?

Game4Padel plans to develop junior programs and high performance programs, to develop the sport’s growth and get a young generation Olympic-ready.

“There’s an arms race to try and get a spot in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics,” Daley says. “Padel’s a fair way in front, but there’s a pretty big checklist to tick off and probably a few things that the governing body is still a bit short on. With pickleball, there’s no single international governing body … and if you haven’t got that, the reality is you’ve got no chance.”

McMullen is frustrated by all the red tape. In part, it’s a lack of enthusiasm from local councils and constituencies – “It’s like we’re asking to put in a fucking nightclub” – but he also cites the ambivalent approach of Tennis Australia, who promote padel, but who also recommend that the integration “not come at the expense of well-utilised tennis facilities or tennis programming”. In other words, tennis clubs aren’t encouraged to surrender a court to accommodate padel.

Rivalry aside, in the end all three players think that interest in one sport will naturally boost interest in the other. And tennis will come around. Eventually.





Am lucky enough to be heading off to Wembley with a bunch of lifetime friends to watch my beloved Addicks in our 3rd outing in the brilliantly cruel PlayOff Finals.

With exception of birth of child, ‘98 was probably the most amazing experience of my life, only tempered by vivid memories of sobbing Sunderland fans on way out - a scene repeated in 2019.

Very pleased for them yesterday.

I’m sure a Champions League final, or winning the Premiership would be incredible, but they would appear to be somewhat unrealistic targets for Charlton.

The PlayOffs are so unfair, but what drama. So much riding on one game. Part of me wants to wish Orient good luck, because they’ve had a terrific second half of the season.

Obviously I can’t. There can be only one.

COYR!!!

In a perfect world, what would the final day of the Premier League season look like? You’d have two sides going for the title – perhaps three or even four, all playing teams of similar standard and motivation. You’d have maybe six teams contesting the three relegation slots, possibly playing each other, and also a skirmish for European qualification.

Ideally all 10 games would mean something and there should be times over the course of the afternoon when each side have the set of results they need to achieve their aims. And there should definitely be a moment when it becomes apparent that a harassed television presenter has forgotten or overlooked a goal so viewers can mutter furiously at the screen: “For heavens’ sake, that puts Brentford in ninth.”

In reality 10 live games is probably too much to ask – and the disorientating experience of the final night of the Champions League group stage suggests it may be too much to comprehend anyway – but six of Sunday afternoon’s games potentially have something riding on them and one is a bona fide head-to-head, winner-takes-it-all clash.

There has been a lot of talk about this being a poor or an anticlimactic season. While the latter term may be fair with regard to the title race and the relegation battle, the former certainly is not. The title race was in effect over from 18 January, the Saturday when Liverpool won with two late goals at Brentford and Arsenal threw away a two-goal lead at home to Aston Villa. The relegation battle was done once Wolves had brought in Vítor Pereira while Leicester went for Ruud van Nistelrooy and Southampton for Ivan Juric. The most crucial issues were decided early.

But as to the allegation this was somehow a season lacking in quality, it is always worth remembering that multiple themes can be true simultaneously. Arsenal and especially Manchester City have had disappointing seasons by their standards and that meant Liverpool were not challenged as they might have been. Arsenal, having drawn too many games, will finish second for the third season running but having offered less of a challenge than in the previous two years, while City could yet miss out on the Champions League if they lose at Fulham and Newcastle, Chelsea and Aston Villa all win. Equally, none of the three promoted sides ever looked remotely good enough to survive.

It is worth, though, asking why they struggled so much and why City and Arsenal were punished for wobbles. The major reason is probably the general strength of the middle ranks of the Premier League – which is why Liverpool’s consistency deserves more praise than many seemed prepared to give them. Every team from Newcastle in fourth down to Crystal Palace in 12th have had games they will remember fondly and would be more than worthy English representatives in European competition next season.

Bournemouth, for instance, played some exceptional football at times, beating Arsenal (twice), Manchester City and Newcastle. They have a centre-back they have already sold to Real Madrid for £50m and a full-back they look like selling to Liverpool for £40m, yet they go into the final day of the season with no chance of European qualification. There have been times recently when Andoni Iraola, one of those coaches named by Pep Guardiola as shaping the football of the future, has been frustrated by his side’s occasional inability to manage games as he would like, but this has been the greatest season in Bournemouth’s history.

Of the 30 richest by revenue in the world, 14 are Premier League clubs. On the one hand, that suggests the strength of the league and the power of its marketing. But that brings its own problems and highlights perhaps the biggest issue football has, which is that almost no one in authority thinks holistically.

Money for one or two clubs as, say, the Club World Cup will provide, can unbalance a domestic league. One country prospers and others are left behind. The Champions League now – as a competition to be won rather than a generator of cash – essentially exists for four countries plus Paris Saint-Germain, while others scrabble for crumbs that will make them wealthy enough to ensure domination of their domestic leagues.

The standard of almost every side in the Premier League now is exceptional, which is why the three teams promoted from the Championship, almost no matter how well run they are, will face a major challenge to stay up. What Brentford have achieved with the second-lowest wage bill in the Premier League is remarkable, but they are almost uniquely well run. To have even a chance of survival, promoted sides need either a world-leading algorithmic approach to transfers, as Brentford and Bournemouth do, or a manager of rare gifts, such as Marcelo Bielsa (and, perhaps, although he seems rarely thought of in this light, Thomas Frank).

And then there are Nottingham Forest, who have shown that it is possible for a side promoted via the playoffs not only to survive but to prosper, even if it has taken 57 signings with a net spend of £125m over the past three years – and a four-point deduction for breaches of profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) – to do so. Against that, the transfer activity of the side they face on Sunday in what is in effect a straight shootout for Champions League qualification looks almost restrained. Chelsea in the same period have made 42 signings at a net cost of £660m: 99 signings battling it out for Champions League cash feels a perfect symbol of the modern world.

This is where the positive impact of PSR can be seen. Manchester United cannot spend their way out of trouble. If Chelsea lose, they will find ambitions restricted. Forest, meanwhile, could suddenly be elevated, probably not to be regular Champions League qualifiers, but at least to be fairly secure in mid-table, adding further heft to the Premier League’s middle class.

Which is good for the Premier League, and maintains its traditional strength – recently challenged – as a competition of consistent quality that can be won by more than just a couple of super-clubs. But at the same time, there are consequences for the rest of the pyramid and for the rest of Europe and the world.

Jack Grealish is prowling. The wind tousling his hair, the ball at his feet, the way it was always meant to be. In front of him a wall of Bournemouth defenders jumpily stands guard, eyes wide like stags ready to bolt. Grealish shuffles inside, body feinting, hips dancing. You want to know what happens next. What happens next is that the referee blows for full time.

It’s the 97th minute; Grealish came on in the 91st. In that time Bournemouth somehow managed to score a goal. It wasn’t Grealish’s fault, but it did eat up most of the time in which he was hoping to make an impression. No matter. As the game ends, the cameras hunt down a treble-winning City legend making what might well be his final appearance at the Etihad Stadium. Kevin De Bruyne takes his handshakes and his tributes. Grealish slips quietly down the tunnel.

Still, even this brief uncredited cameo represents progress of sorts. In City’s previous three games Grealish did not even make it off the bench. In last weekend’s FA Cup final, with City chasing an equaliser, he watched as Pep Guardiola brought on a 19-year-old debutant in Claudio Echeverri instead of him. Opponents against whom Grealish has played 90 minutes in 2025: Salford, Leyton Orient, Plymouth, Leicester. Over the league season as a whole Grealish has played just 22% of City’s minutes.

After the Bournemouth game on Tuesday night Grealish will have heard that Guardiola would rather quit City than be forced to carry on leaving players “in the freezer”, frozen out of the matchday squad. On Grealish he declared: “He has to come back to play minutes to start to play again.” Want to play minutes, Jack? It’s simple! Just play more minutes!

Of course it is just possible Grealish may be able to read between the lines here. And in a way, the separation process has been taking place over years rather than weeks. Signed in the summer of 2021 for a British record £100m – and still the seventh most expensive footballer of all time – Grealish feels in retrospect increasingly like a short-term solution to a short-term need, a player signed for a team and perhaps even a game that no longer really exists.

And of course the first thing that needs to be said at this point is, you know, fair enough. £100m should be buying you a generation-defining player: instead, apart from one superb season in the 2022-23 treble-winning side, Grealish never really came close to justifying the faith invested in him. A record of 12 goals and 12 assists in four Premier League seasons speaks for itself. As Guardiola put it earlier this season: “In the end, it is about performance, delivering assists and goals.”

Even so, it’s instructive to go back to Grealish’s first season at City, a season in which Grealish openly fretted about his lack of hard numbers and was slapped down in public by his manager for doing so. “Always we talk about statistics,” Guardiola scolded. “Players today play for the statistics but this is the biggest mistake they can do. We didn’t buy him to score 45 goals. He has other qualities.”

But of course the City team of 2021-22 was flush with goals from all areas: from Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden and De Bruyne, and Gabriel Jesus and Bernardo Silva. The following season a 52-goal striker would be signed in Erling Haaland. What Guardiola demanded from Grealish was control. Control of the ball, control of tempo, progression up the pitch, acceleration, deceleration.

The Grealish of Villa from 2019-21 would probably be perfect for City now, yet the Grealish of City now is very much not

These days, with Haaland ailing and City scrapping to reach next season’s Champions League, the demands are different. Even compared with two years ago the Premier League is more dynamic, more vertical, this City less able to dominate territory than their predecessors. Whatever happens against Fulham on Sunday, City will end this season with their lowest average possession since the Manuel Pellegrini era. In this shifting landscape the capacity for a struggling side to carry a winger with no straight-line pace and no goal threat is gently receding.

So if Guardiola subtly moved the goalposts on Grealish, perhaps it is because the goalposts also subtly moved on Guardiola. The ability to retain possession in dangerous areas has become less important than the ability to use it quickly, which is why players such as Jérémy Doku and Savinho have found themselves preferred this season. The signing of Omar Marmoush in January, a forward who operates in very similar spaces to Grealish, is another reminder of the rapidly changing nature of the job: one defined by speed, directness, thrumming momentum and getting shots off.

Naturally there will be the usual mutterings about Grealish’s lifestyle, but while this is a player who could probably do with getting photographed in the pub a little less, there is little evidence on the pitch to suggest that he has neglected himself, or let his physical standards drop. Rather, the tale of Grealish is a parable of how extreme wealth inequality allows the biggest clubs not just to accumulate talent but to mould it: to change its nature, to render it more immediately useful but also a little more boring, to narrow its horizons.

On joining City, Grealish was forced to adjust his game radically: to focus more on recycling possession, winning fouls, eking out yards rather than unleashing the tricks and flourishes that made him so beloved at Aston Villa. These were the compromises necessary to take Grealish from the Championship to the top step of the Champions League, and he was handsomely rewarded for it too. But there is a certain irony in the fact that the Grealish of Villa between 2019 and 2021 would probably be the perfect player for City now, and yet the Grealish of City now is very much not.

So despite signing Grealish for £100m there is no real pressure on City to make this signing work. Take the hit, sell him to Newcastle or Tottenham, move on without regrets. Grealish is 29 now. He has given City his peak years. And he will be bleakly aware, in more ways than one, that he never had quite as much time as he thought he did.

Ruben Amorim will make a public apology to Manchester United fans on the pitch after their final home game of the season, but the head coach admitted he does not know how long it will take the club to challenge at the top of the table again. United face Aston Villa on Sunday to conclude a desperate season without a trophy and potentially in 17th place, but the players will undertake a lap of honour at Old Trafford.

Their last chance of salvaging something from the campaign ended with a dismal performance in the Europa League final on Wednesday, losing 1-0 to Tottenham, ensuring United will not compete in Europe next season.

“An apology is clear. An explanation, you don’t have time,” Amorim said of his planned speech. “I will be honest with the fans and I will say what is in my mind and what is in my heart.”

Amorim said of the lap of honour: “It’s tradition and we have to face it. It will be the biggest mistake if we don’t do that. I know that the manager addresses the public, I will do that because it’s the minimum. The least I can do is to talk with the fans and to say what I want to say. I will decide tomorrow, I have an idea, so we will do that because if there is a season that we need to do it, it’s this one, and of course we will be there.”

Since arriving in November, Amorim has secured six Premier League victories in his 26 games in charge but insists the club is now healthier than when he arrived. United would finish the season one place above the relegation zone if Tottenham fare better on Sunday.

“Things can change fast,” he said. “But to reach the kind of level that we need to be as Manchester United is going to take time. But I cannot say how many windows, how many years we need to reach that point. But we can improve. That is clear.”

Asked if United’s issues were bigger than he thought when offered the job, Amorim said: “Yes, the problems for me was deeper than I was thinking because I can watch, I can feel it during training at Carrington, all our organisation, then it’s not the problems, but the stability in our club.

“Everybody is changing, all the departments are changing, so we did that in one year. In six months, we are doing everything, so everything is more difficult, but I think we are getting some steps to improve things. You cannot see that because results are so poor, but we are in a better place, that I can guarantee you.”

Amorim refused to be drawn on the future of Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho. Fernandes, the club captain, has been linked with a move to the Middle East, with the Saudi Pro League team Al-Hilal reportedly setting a deadline next week for a decision, while Garnacho cast doubt on his own future after complaining about being left on the bench until the last 20 minutes of Wednesday’s final.

Amorim said: “The focus is the last game. I don’t know what is going to happen. We have a plan, we were prepared for both situations – with Champions League and without Champions League. We have an idea of the type of squad we want but now we focus on the game because we still have the last game and we have time to address all these situations.”

Arne Slot believes his Liverpool players can take inspiration from Bruce Springsteen as they aim to repeat the success of winning the Premier League next season. The Dutchman went to see the Boss behind enemy lines in Manchester on Tuesday night to witness a masterclass of a different kind.

Liverpool will be awarded the Premier League trophy by Alan Hansen after their final game of the season against Crystal Palace on Sunday. The next challenge for Slot will come when his players return for pre-season training on 8 July and the Dutchman waits to see if his squad can build on the glory days achieved during his first season in charge.

“You talk about elite mentality,” Slot said of Springsteen. “This guy’s been doing it for 50-odd years and he’s still putting on three-hour shows in front of 25,000 people. I’ve heard how he does this, what he does in his daily life, talking about habits, how disciplined he is to achieve this. Springsteen, at 75, is still able to do three hours on stage without even one minute of rest. He took three or four drinks of what I assume was water.”

Slot has admitted to wanting more from Trent Alexander-Arnold during pre-season and hopes his players follow the example of Mohamed Salah in the summer, who was born to run and finished top of the fitness charts on day one under the head coach.

“One of the reasons why you play at a club like Liverpool is because you have elite mentality, and you have the mentality of a serial winner,” Slot said. “But sometimes as a manager you have to help them a little bit to inspire them, or to be hard on them, or to compliment them.

“I’ve seen this already with Mo Salah, I always give him as an example, because last season he was number one when we had this [fitness] test in the league and that told me a lot. That’s why he’s for seven years already at elite level. And if you look at all the elite players in all different sports, they all say the same. If you want to be a serial winner, it’s just about consistency in your discipline throughout your whole career or your whole life.

“Last season many of my players, and myself, hadn’t won the league in England. A few of them only had – now they’ve all won it. Now let’s see how they react.”

There is always a little more time than you think. A red number 7 blinks across the pitch from the fourth official’s board. Seven minutes of injury time: it’s a lot. Against Barcelona, it’s an age. Against this Barcelona, in this heat, in this game, it may as well be all of eternity.

But you push through. You pace yourself. Beth Mead goes down under a challenge; there’s 30 seconds right there. Kim Little rolls the ball up the left touchline to no one: eight seconds. Daphne van Domselaar hesitates over a free-kick, squeezing out those seconds like drops from a towel. You push through because whatever happens in these seven minutes, however those minutes make you suffer, seven minutes is still less than 18 years.

There is a whistle, and then there is a scream, and then there is pure confusion. Arsenal have planned this game to the very last detail, rehearsed every last contingency, mapped out every possible scenario. But not this one. Some run; some stagger. But in these earliest moments of triumph, wherever they are on the pitch, somehow it feels telling that the first instinct of these Arsenal players is to find each other.

Meanwhile Barcelona collapse, not just in distress but in a kind of violent shock: a shock that seems to consume them physically, to shake every fibre of their being. As if they cannot truly believe anyone would dare to do this to them. Next to the centre circle a podium is hastily being erected, a confetti cannon winched into place, and they still can’t believe it’s not for them.

People often say, with a vaguely fatalistic subtext, that you have to play the perfect game against Barcelona. Which is all very well, but then what happens when you make a mistake? Arsenal did not play the perfect game, even if several individuals got pretty close. But they won anyway, because they understood that finals are not simply a form of expression but a form of combat, not simply a vehicle for skills and stratagems but a vehicle for courage.

And we should be clear at this point what kind of courage we mean. This is not simply the courage of crunching tackles and lunging blocks, of putting your head where it hurts. It is the courage of playing the forward pass when the backward pass is on, of keeping the ball on the ground when every impulse tells you to get rid, of taking your time on the ball, because there is always a little more time than you think.

It is the courage of starting well, having a goal disallowed, missing chances, but not succumbing to fatalism. Of Leah Williamson stepping in to win the ball, even though she risks getting turned. Of flooding the area with bodies even though you know how well Barcelona can transition. Of showing the greatest team in the history of women’s club football all the respect they deserve, but not an ounce more.

Arsenal’s goal, a masterclass of grace under pressure, was perhaps the best example of this. Mariona Caldentey receives the ball on the right wing, and immediately the options flutter in front of her. The first-time cross is on. The sliding pass to Katie McCabe in the channel is on. Instead she waits, waits for the picture to unblur in front of her. And eventually Mead presents herself, and the pass is perfect, and the shot from Stina Blackstenius is perfect, and in the most perfect twist of all, she’s actually onside this time.

For Arsenal, this changes everything. There will be a parade on Monday, and a mural on the side of the Emirates, there will be award ceremonies and tie-in merchandise, there will be functions and reunions. Over time Lisbon 2025 will take its place in the club’s mythology, as surely as Meadow Park 2007, White Hart Lane 2004, Anfield 1989.

But of course it changes so much more than this. For those fans today who were not fans 18 years ago, Arsenal have slowly become the sort of club that dares but does not do, that fails elegantly and succeeds rarely, that wants to win but ultimately does not need to: a trendy leisurewear brand with a football team attached. These are traits that hard-wire themselves over time, and yet can be magically undone in the course of one sweltering afternoon.

Arsenal are European champions. Those four small words now define how this club sees itself, how these players step on to the pitch, how opponents treat them, how prospective signings view the project. For Little, for Williamson, for Blackstenius, for Renée Slegers and for Clare Wheatley, the director of women’s football, and the Arsenal board, it is a form of vindication that will sustain them in their toughest moments. Each of them will walk a little taller on Sunday morning.

Most days, nothing changes. The games and the sessions and the seasons all blur into one eventually. But then there are the days that will be remembered in perfect clarity, forever: days when a plan comes together, days when the wheel of history is stopped in its tracks. Together, Little and Williamson clasp the trophy, raise it aloft. The music plays. The confetti flies. When it lands, nothing will be the same again.

Euphoria. Complete and utter euphoria. Stina Blackstenius’s second-half goal stunned the three-time European champions Barcelona to deliver Arsenal’s second European title. On the final whistle it was red and white pandemonium as stunned Gunners seemed to not know what to do with themselves – hugs, tears, disbelief.

They started so brightly, playing with the freedom and joy that they had not afforded themselves until they had reached this final. There is nothing to lose once you pass that semi-final hurdle and everything to play for in a one-off game and a free-scoring Barcelona, who scored 128 goals in 30 league games this season, looked slightly shocked by the resistance they faced.

At the Estádio José Alvalade, expectations of a result were low, a glimmer of hope delivered by the gutsy second-leg comebacks against Real Madrid and Lyon, in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively, and the sublime way they have played at times this season.

The sense of fun was born from the wider mood around the fixture and that spirit was evident on the pitch too. There was a fearlessness about Arsenal: instead of resorting to a double pivot against the holders, Renée Slegers, who was given the job full-time in January after taking interim charge following Jonas Eidevall’s exit in October, stuck with a formula that had worked for them in the second leg of their semi-final against Lyon and against Manchester United on the final day of the Women’s Super League season. Arsenal were not in Lisbon to sit back, they were there to take the game to the Catalan giants and their pressing play and organisation in the opening half were superb.

Their battling approach and the freedom with which they played clearly frustrated the champions and Slegers’ side had the better chances of the half: Caitlin Foord’s header wide of the far post, Chloe Kelly’s volley over the bar, a disallowed own goal with Kelly offside in the buildup and Cata Coll’s save from Frida Maanum, all close but not close enough.

Reaching the break with the game goalless was an achievement against a Barcelona side playing their 100th Champions League game, their first coincidentally against Arsenal in the 2012-13 last 32.

The serious attitude Arsenal as a whole have taken towards the women’s team was evident in the stands – the co-chairman Josh Kroenke had come from Denver to join assorted members of the hierarchy and David Dein, the former vice-chairman and former president of the women’s team. That stood in sharp contrast to the indifference shown to Manchester United Women by their minority owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, whose absence at the past two FA Cup finals was widely derided.

The Blaugrana, seeking a hat-trick of wins, stepped up a gear in the second half but Arsenal’s defence, which shipped 12 goals in their final three games of the WSL season, stood firm.

They needed one chance, one escape into the Barça half, and it came in the 74th minute. A rare Arsenal corner was cleared but worked back in to the former Barcelona player Mariona Caldentey, who paused before finding Beth Mead hovering on the edge of the box. The England forward played in her fellow substitute Blackstenius and the Swede fired low past Coll.

Barcelona were sure it was offside, but it wasn’t; the crowd jeered, the pocket of Arsenal fans roared and the team that is king of the dark arts, of slowing a game, stifling play and disrupting momentum, started to be given a taste of their own medicine.

The Barcelona fans had been the loudest throughout, but it was the corner of 5,000-plus Arsenal fans that rocked the stadium at the close, the 5,000 watching back home at the Emirates presumably doing the same.

It was a nervy final 13 minutes plus added time but Arsenal’s back line maintained their focus and composure.

The club had got as close as they could to bottling history and feeding it to the players in the buildup: there was a lunch with the 2007 European champions, notes from fans, staff and the community were pinned to a wall for them to peruse before their flight, and emotion-packed videos of who they are, where they have been and the shoulders they stand on set the tone.

Then they went out and submitted a new chapter to the history book, re-stamped their authority as the most decorated side in English football and cried. A lot.

The Arsenal head coach, Renée Slegers, said her team’s performance was “above all expectations” after they stunned Barcelona to win the Women’s Champions League title in Lisbon.

Cited as the major underdogs before kick-off, Arsenal thwarted a Barcelona side who had won three of the past four finals, and won their first women’s European title since 2007 thanks to substitute Stina Blackstenius’ 74th-minute winner.

“I’m super proud, because you can have all these ideas in your head and show videos and use your tactics board and all those things, but when the moment is actually there, to then execute this in a Champions League final, it says so much about the players,” said Slegers, whose team knocked out Real Madrid and the eight-times champions Lyon on their route to the final. “We had to suffer at times but the way we managed the game, for me it was unbelievable. It was above all expectations. We were spot on in the crucial moments.”

The 36-year-old Dutchwoman has been in permanent charge of Arsenal for only 127 days since her appointment in January, after initially stepping up as their interim head coach in October after Jonas Eidevall’s resignation, but she has overseen a rapid resurgence in the club’s fortunes to deliver one of the greatest days in their history in the heat of the Portuguese capital.

Slegers also believes there are more improvements to come from her team, adding: “There’s been so much engagement and investment and belief and intensity in the way we trained. I’m so happy for everyone that they got the rewards today. They are so worth it. They worked extremely hard. There is still more in this team and that is the scary part.”

Arsenal’s victory was particularly special for their former Scotland midfielder Kim Little, who first joined the club in 2008 and rejoined the north London side in 2017. After captaining them to glory, she said: “We knew coming into this game that we had to be basically perfect to beat this Barcelona team. The team showed incredible discipline. Across the board it was just incredible.

“It’s very special for me. I’ve been at the club a very long time and we have had incredible periods where we have been successful. The club won it in 2007 and I signed the year after that. To still be at the club now and see how much it has done to progress the women’s game and invest in us as players and as a club, it is truly special. To be sitting here now today off the back of winning the ultimate trophy for club football, it is definitely the best moment of my career.”

Arsenal are the only British women’s club to have ever lifted a European title but this was their first time in the final since winning a quadruple of major honours in the 2007 campaign. Since then they have had to endure their neighbours Chelsea dominating the domestic silverware but they remain by far the English women’s game’s most decorated club, with a record 14 Women’s FA Cups to their name as well as 15 top-flight titles and 16 League Cups across two different iterations of that cup.

Slegers hinted they will seek to use their victory as a springboard for more silverware domestically, as they try to end Chelsea’s run of six consecutive English league titlesShe added: “This means so much for everyone who has built towards this across many years, but it also means so much for the future, because it motivates people, it motivates us and it shows what we are capable of. Of course, if you are part of Arsenal you go for trophies. That’s what the club wants and that is what we want as well.”

Arsenal

Daphne van Domselaar Made several strong punches in the first half and a vital low save to keep out Bonmati in the second. 7

Emily Fox Produced some good tackles and kept Claudia Pina significantly quieter than Chelsea managed to in the semi-finals. 7

Leah Williamson More blocks than a Lego house and downtown Manhattan combined. The Queen of interceptions tonight, too. What a performance. 9

Steph Catley Really resilient against some of the world’s best forwards and produced a crucial clearance from Rolfö’s low cross in the second half. 8

Katie McCabe The sort of tough-tackling left-back Barcelona aren’t used to. Kept Caroline Graham Hansen at bay, which is no mean feat. 8

Frida Maanum Worked really hard off the ball. Crept offside for what had looked like Arsenal’s first goal before the VAR review. 8

Kim Little Missed a big chance early on but otherwise her performance was masterful and she has deserved this trophy for her exemplary career. 7

Mariona Caldentey The signing of the season. Surely Barcelona are regretting letting her go? Great both on the ball and off the ball. 8

Chloe Kelly Not a vintage display but she had a job to do for the team and she did it dutifully. Her decision to move on loan in January has certainly paid off. 6

Alessia Russo Showed top-class hold-up play throughout and was Arsenal’s crucial out-ball, vital to the way they linked the play. Strong physically. Good performance. 8

Caitlin Foord Defensively she was immense, helping double up on the wingers, and she put in several important blocks, as well as looking threatening going forward. 8

Subs: Blackstenius (Maanum 67) The match-winner. So often ridiculed by fans of other clubs, now she’s the hero. Took her goal superbly. Missed two other chances but who cares? 8, Mead (Kelly 68) Played an excellent through ball to provide the assist for the winning goal and adds the club European title to her England Euros glory. 7, Hurtig (Foord 86) 6, Wubben-Moy (Russo 90+1) 6

Barcelona

Cata Coll Saved superbly from Maanum in the first half and then did well with her feet to stop Blackstenius’ first chance, but was well-beaten for the winner. 7

Ona Batlle Fired off target with a few long-range efforts and had a hard time against a confident Foord. 6

Irene Paredes Picked up a booking and had her blushes spared by VAR for what would have been a clumsy own goal. Made some good tackles but Russo got the better of her. 6

Mapi León Great to watch on the ball, as ever, but defensively was exposed a couple of times. 6

Fridolina Rolfö Very effective when marauding down the left and enjoyed a good battle with Fox. Played in a couple of crosses that deserved to be converted. 7

Aitana Bonmatí Remarkably stylish and graceful in-possession, a joy to watch, but did not take her chances tonight. Still the world’s most outstanding player. 7

Patri Guijarro Unable to be anywhere near as impactful as she has been in previous finals, largely because of Arsenal’s excellent work rate. 6

Alexia Putellas Nowhere near as dangerous as expected and looked very frustrated by the end. Plenty of flashes of brilliance but no end product today. 6

Caroline Graham Hansen Unable to get the better of McCabe, overhit a cross on a rare time when she did get past the Irishwoman, but gave the ball away too much. 6

Ewa Pajor Scarcely involved in the game at all. Headed over from a decent chance. A disappointing end to a season where she had looked unstoppable. 5

Claudia Pina Inventive movement, unfortunate not to score when she hit the crossbar and was perhaps unlucky to be taken off. 7

Subs: Salma Paralluelo (Pina 62) Not the super sub the Barcelona fans were expecting. Still a very young player with a superb array of talents and probably a future Ballon d’Or winner. 6, Brugts (Rolfö 78) 6, Engen (León 78) 5

Northampton have urged tournament officials to launch an investigation into a post-game fracas involving England’s Henry Pollock after Bordeaux’s Champions Cup final victory. It is understood Saints will make a citing complaint if the incident does not lead to an official disciplinary probe.

Phil Dowson, Saints’ director of rugby, said the 20-year-old had been the victim of “foul play” by a Bordeaux player. The meleé was initially sparked by an altercation between the Northampton captain, Fraser Dingwall, and the French international fly-half Matthieu Jalibert, before several other Bordeaux players became involved.

Dowson was swift to congratulate Bordeaux on their victory but was clearly unimpressed by what unfolded after the final whistle. “There was a fracas at the end, there was foul play involved and I have been assured the touch judge has seen it and will deal with it appropriately,” said the former England back-row forward. “Henry Pollock was particularly upset by it because it was uncalled for and out of order and so he reacted. The officials have told me they will deal with it.”

Saints’ England fly-half Fin Smith also suggested the French players had previously been riled by Pollock during the game. “They were after him. I don’t think they liked him. He’ll be all right. I remember they all sort of charged at him and tried to get hold of him. If you have just won a European Cup I’m surprised if the first thing you want to do is start a fight with a 20-year-old. I felt that was interesting.”

Dingwall said he did not think there was bad blood during the game but felt the increasing number of players appealing for decisions was against the “values” of the game. “There were a couple of moments when boys potentially didn’t adhere to those things and that’s going to spark a reaction,” he said.

Dowson stressed he was extremely proud of his players for the way they battled on despite a number of injuries. He said George Furbank, driven away on a medical cart after an early collision, was fine but acknowledged the permanent removal of two-thirds of Northampton’s back three inside the first four minutes had had “a huge impact” on the contest.

Dingwall said his team were extremely frustrated to have fallen just short: “There was loads of fight and that sums us up this year – unfortunately we just gave them too many opportunities and didn’t win the critical moments.

“It is frustrating when it is such small margins but that is the way this game is. We stayed in there but unfortunately when you play against top teams you can’t give them opportunities. We didn’t fire as many shots as we could have done. It is going to be frustrating to look back on.”

Bordeaux scored a remarkable 54 tries in their eight Champions Cup games this season, 14 of them by their France winger Damian Penaud who was named player of the tournament.

Penaud scored two of his side’s four tries in the final and is the third Frenchman to win the award in a row, following in the footsteps of Antoine Dupont and Grégory Alldritt. “First of all, we will drink beer and then after that we will think about the Top 14,” said Penaud, whose side are also still in contention for the domestic league title.

Meanwhile, European Professional Club Rugby has announced the first World Club Cup will take place in 2028. A tournament featuring the best club sides from the northern and southern hemispheres, to be held every four years, has received unanimous backing from all the sport’s governing bodies.

Sixteen teams will qualify – eight from the Champions Cup and the remainder drawn from Super Rugby Pacific and Japan. The EPCR chairman, Dominic McKay, confirmed before the Champions Cup final that an idea mooted for “the last two or three years” will now be delivered.

Beneath the roof of Welsh rugby’s noisiest cathedral here was a game to raise anybody’s blood pressure. There have been some extraordinary finals in this tournament but none as breathless or frenetic for such long periods. This was rugby on fast forward, a blink-and-you-miss-it thriller that finally ended with Bordeaux winning the first Champions Cup title in their history.

They just about deserved their special vintage but what a contest. Northampton, reduced to 13 players at one stage with two men in the sin-bin, were heroically brave and insanely committed. Every single Saint refused to bend the knee despite a worsening casualty list and collectively played a full part in a final that rocked and rolled from start to finish.

Alex Coles, who scored two outstanding first-half tries, and Tommy Freeman were both utterly magnificent for Saints, closely followed by any number of their gallant colleagues. Bordeaux had a plethora of stars of their own but even the gifted Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Damian Penaud could not shake off the stubborn ‘Shoe Army’ until the closing moments.

It made for exactly the type of final the connoisseurs had been hoping for, with Northampton digging as deep as they did in their extraordinary semi-final win against Leinster. They had a similar proactive plan this time but, as in their last final in Cardiff in 2011, they could not finish what they started and failed to score a single point after half-time.

Injuries were partly to blame, with James Ramm and George Furbank both forced off within the first four minutes. The latter departed on the medical cart after Romain Buros’s knee caught him nastily in the head while he was out of the game trying to regain his feet. It was deemed to be ‘only’ a rugby incident, however, and left Saints without one of their most influential figures.

Not that there was any time to pause and reflect. Coles and Penaud swapped cracking early tries and Bordeaux might have had a second not long afterwards when a brilliant backline move launched by Matthieu Jalibert was belatedly called back for a glaring forward pass by Bielle-Biarrey to Penaud. Too many such passes have escaped the censors this season so it was both a correct and timely call.

In broken field, though, UBB can be totally devastating. Jalibert seemed to be going nowhere when he was lobbed the ball around 25 metres out but the fly-half has a recurring ability to pluck a lapin from any chapeau. Five would-be Saints tacklers were left sprawled in his wake as he weaved his way right and then lobbed a delicate basketball-style pass to the giant Australian lock Adam Coleman. Mustard-sharp indeed.

Northampton had to find a foothold and duly found one thanks to a long-range penalty from Fin Smith that just sneaked over the distant crossbar. Jalibert responded in kind but his side were then reduced to 14 men when Mahamadou Diaby was sent to the sin-bin for a shoulder to the head of Temo Mayanavanua.

Another Smith penalty narrowed the gap to two points again but now Bordeaux were trying to buy time and slow the game down. Not so Northampton who thought they had scored through a charging Henry Pollock only for the try to be ruled out because the flanker was offside when Smith put in his rolling chip kick.

It was not the ideal moment, then, for Saints to lose a man of their own, Freeman tackling Penaud when the flying winger was still airborne. As has become their trademark Bordeaux were swift to capitalise, with the opportunistic Penaud again finding his way to the right corner.

But Northampton had pledged all week to stay positive, no matter what. Despite their crumbling back three resources they still poured forwards and smart passes from Fraser Dingwall and Ollie Sleightholme put Coles over for his second. The England forward was almost sidelined beforehand by a knee injury but his contribution was extraordinary nonetheless.

With the score now back level at 20-20 the half-time message in the Saints dressing room was no secret: it was just a question of keeping playing, regardless of the odds. ‘Why Not Us?’ has been the mantra and even the lesser-known members of the squad have fully bought into it.

They also had Pollock, for whom little is currently impossible. Within two minutes of the restart, the 20-year-old was released down the blindside by Curtis Langdon for exactly the kind of cheeky score that is becoming his speciality. Again, though, it was not to be: Coles had been spotted tugging a would-be defender back off the ball and Bordeaux were awarded a penalty instead.

Thrust and counter thrust, with barely a pause for breath. Out of nowhere Saints were suddenly down to 13 after Ed Prowse saw yellow for another high challenge. Bizarrely the man of the match Maxime Lucu opted to kick the penalty goal rather than turn the screw via the forwards and when Bordeaux subsequently dropped the ball over the line with a try an apparent certainty the plot briefly thickened again. Cyril Cazeaux’s 55th minute try, though, gave Saints another mountain to climb which, ultimately, proved just too high.

And the broader experience? The Northampton own-brand Hawaiian shirts were great and the visiting French contingent were in excellent voice, too. You had to feel slightly for all the Leinster fans who had bought tickets in anticipation of their side making the final but those neutrals who did travel could scarcely complain about value for money. Big rugby days do not come much more exhilarating.

A new name is on the cup. They reckon Union Bordeaux Bègles are the best-supported rugby union club in the world. To be in Cardiff was not to be disabused of the notion. Rugby is massive in France, on a par with football, and bigger in the southern half of the country. It creates a different kind of animal.

Northampton were proud, brave, inventive – but in the end overpowered. The narrative was wild and, Saints might say, liable to have gone either way. A raucous stadium – for Northampton are one of the best supported in England – was treated to crazy fluctuations in fortune, tries scored and overturned, penalties, knock-ons and high tackles subject to review after review.

But when the dust settled, the reality of a top club in the sport’s biggest market imposed itself on Northampton, champions of England maybe, but a side who have hit their straps this season only in this competition. What a job they have made of it.

It has almost been tacitly accepted in English rugby that glory days in Europe may have to wait for a while, so much more powerful and deep are the squads in French and Irish rugby these days. Saints and Harlequins worked wonders to make the semi-finals last year, but to go a step further again was a triumph against all odds for the former, given their injuries and the vagaries in form.

Alas, the echoes of their previous appearance in this final, here in 2011, were all too poignant. Back then they rattled up a 22-6 lead against Leinster by half-time, only to ship 27 unanswered points. No such indignity this time. Alex Coles scored tries at either end of the first half to level 20-20 at the break. But the spectre of a scoreless second half returned, despite Henry Pollock’s dash to the line from a lineout early, chalked off for a tug by Coles. Bordeaux ground out eight unanswered points for the win.

Pollock’s was but one of a number of incidents subjected to trial by TMO. He had another effort chalked off five minutes from the break, marginally offside when he touched down Fin Smith’s chip ahead. Bordeaux had two of their own disallowed, one for a forward pass between their deadly wingers, Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Damian Penaud, the latter adding another two tries to his tally and collecting the player of the tournament award.

By the end Northampton were still swinging but exhausted. They had picked a team to take the match to the opposition, but it was shot through with risk, a statement of boldness or, some might wonder, a devil-may-care roll of the dice. One surprise recovery from injury is one thing, but to unveil five of them in your squad might not be the sort of gamble a club with a bigger budget would take.

Alas, two of them, James Ramm and George Furbank, were off within the first five minutes, the latter on a stretcher. Suddenly, Northampton had used two of their three backs replacements and one of those was Ollie Sleightholme, out since the Six Nations after ankle surgery. He probably had not banked on playing more or less 80 minutes. Especially not against Bielle-Biarrey and Penaud, the world’s deadliest wingers.

Another surprise was to see Coles line up in the back row. He was another to take a knock against Saracens last week. He seemed to be struggling even in the captain’s run on Friday, but there he was with heavy strapping on his knee. Happily, he left any struggles behind him to have the game of his life, one of those locks absolutely in his element in the extra space of life in the back row. Those tries showcased his talents, powering his way through defenders for the first, deftly handling and galloping in support for the second.

But there could be little argument with the result. Bielle-Biarrey played most of the match at full-back, after Romain Buros left for a head injury assessment, just as Tommy Freeman did after Furbank left. The pair of them were superb in their different ways, even if Freeman took a spell in the bin.

But Bordeaux’s half-backs were key. Maxime Lucu took the match award, continuing to show off how he deserves more than to be considered Antoine Dupont’s understudy. And his partner, Matthieu Jalibert, was bewitching, particularly in that first half, central to Bordeaux’s three first-half tries, beating seven men to set up the second, for Cyril Cazeaux.

They all added to the colour of the occasion. The French fans took the streets of Cardiff by storm before the match, chanting, drumming, marching, the British standing around somewhat bewildered with their cameraphones out to record the pageant. So it continued throughout the match.

Early in the professional era, one of rugby’s grand old cities merged its two deadly rivals. They are a blueprint for how to negotiate the transition from rugby’s amateur ways to a bold modern synthesis that harnesses rare energy for the sport.

The new club’s first trophy, secured in its first European final. They are colourful and passionate. Worthy winners of that other great product of the professional era. Call it what you will, Heineken, Champions, Europe, it continues to bring out the best in rugby. Union Bordeaux Bègles are just the latest.

Ben Stokes criticised the speculation about Ollie Pope’s position in the England team, insisting parts of the media were pursuing “an agenda” against him. On the eve of England’s victory inside three days, the captain was asked about the chances of Jacob Bethell, away playing in the IPL, returning for next month’s series against India.

“If you talk about nailing down a position, Beth has done himself the world of good with the performances he put in [in New Zealand over the winter],” Stokes said. “I think you can put two and two together.”

His comment was widely interpreted that Bethell would return to the starting XI, but after Pope, Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett all scored centuries as England cruised to victory by an innings and 45 runs Stokes said he “made it pretty clear” that Bethell was guaranteed no more than “coming back into the squad”.

“That was written to suit an agenda that was being said away from what is in the team,” he said. “It is unfortunate that you say something and it can get twisted. I made it very clear to Popey the night before this Test that is not the case. He’s my vice-captain and he’s been incredible.

“Popey knows how much I value him, not only as a player but also as a leader, as a vice-captain. He’s someone who I lean on a lot out there. He’s very good in particular when I’m bowling, about a few things that are a lot easier to miss when I’ve got my bowling head on. So, just a big misinterpretation.”

Shoaib Bashir posted career-best figures of six for 81, finishing with nine in the match as England coasted to victory with more than four sessions to spare. “He’s got some unbelievable natural ability, his height and how much he puts on the ball and his ability to be able to change from square seam to upright seam, the skill is undoubted,” Stokes said of the 21-year-old.

“The big progression with him is building towards a dismissal more and not getting a bit too giddy. That was the word he used out there. It’s scary to think about the start to his career that he’s had. To be where he is now, it’s super, super exciting. I can say it’s impossible for him not to get even better than what he is now.”

England’s progress was slowed by half-centuries from Sean Williams and Sikandar Raza and by Ben Curran’s 104-ball 37, all three among Bashir’s victims. “On that first day we weren’t really up to par,” the Zimbabwe captain, Craig Ervine, said. “With our big quicks we didn’t get enough in the right area – when you can do that, especially in these conditions, you ask a lot of questions and unfortunately we didn’t do that, which made it difficult to control the scoring.

“Our goal was to not let them score too quickly, otherwise we knew we were going to be under pressure especially after day one and knowing the way England like to go about their batting. Then from a batting perspective guys really fought hard, we got ourselves into decent positions and couldn’t really kick on from there.

“What you want as a player group is to be able to go back home from this having learned something that you can take with you, that can improve you as a player. There’s a lot of knowledge guys have gained since we’ve been here.”

There were periods of resistance, some eye-catching shots and supporters cheering them on from the stands. But Zimbabwe could not prevent the inevitable or even reach the fourth day. England, inspired by six wickets from Shoaib Bashir, wrapped up this one-off Test by an innings and 45 runs.

Even factoring in lowly opposition who froze on day one and could only battle for respectability thereafter, nine wickets in the match added up to another chapter in Bashir’s remarkable rise. After all, he was plugging away on loan for Glamorgan at the start of the summer and had just two victims to show for it.

Things change when Bashir slips on an England shirt and pops up the collar like Eric Cantona back in the day. Assisted by a breeze and pumped full of weapons-grade confidence by Ben Stokes, the 21-year-old got the ball to drift and drop on Zimbabwe’s batters in a manner that bodes well for the days ahead. India are up next and England need their spinner in form.

It was needed, too. Tasked with backing up their efforts from the previous day, England’s seamers struggled for impact a second time around. Sam Cook was struggling to summon up his county form on debut, while Gus Atkinson was clearly nursing a sore quad muscle and sent down three overs. Josh Tongue, though dutifully pounding in to deliver a short-ball plan for his captain, was not quite extracting the same bite as witnessed 24 hours earlier.

They were also met by a second stirring pushback from Zimbabwe to follow Brian Bennett’s whizz-bang century on day two. Following on and resuming on 30 for two, a fourth-wicket stand worth 122 runs from Sean Williams and Ben Curran – the former dashing, the latter digging in – was giving rise to thoughts of a wicketless morning. Only Stokes looked threatening among the quicks.

But on the stroke of lunch an arm ball from Bashir beat a sweep by Williams on 88 and delivered a tight lbw. Curran slapped one straight to Stokes at cover after the restart to leave Zimbabwe 142 for four, 158 runs arrears, with only a dashing 60 from the experienced Sikandar Raza softening what followed.

Bashir, as Stokes stressed after the win, is not the finished article. But he is a quick learner, as shown by his growing improvement to the right-handers. After unstitching the Zimbabwe lower order – the juiciest being another dipper that castled Tafadzwa Tsiga – those county struggles felt a distant memory.

While Stokes was delighted for Bashir, he was simply in awe at the catch that produced his own wicket. Harry Brook was the fielder in question, producing a one-handed screamer above his head at second slip to remove Wesley Madhevere for 31. Having left Stuart Broad aghast on this ground with a similar stunner 10 years ago, Stokes was now the one wide-eyed.

Beyond the niggle to Atkinson, and perhaps some concerns at Cook looking a bit toothless on day two, it added up to a pretty satisfactory outing for England. Most encouraging was probably Stokes sending down 11.2 overs without the body creaking. That he extracted good movement from a batter-friendly surface was an added bonus.

While he would have liked some time in the middle, his top order cashed in on the first day with centuries for Ben Duckett, Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope. The subject of the latter’s place was the captain’s only gripe, insisting his suggestion of an instant return for Jacob Bethell before the match had been misinterpreted. After Pope’s 171, even against a callow attack on a high-scoring ground, Bethell will surely have to wait his turn.

As for Zimbabwe, it is not often a team swept aside by an innings is the one doing the lap of honour. But after waiting 22 years to play in England, and Bennett etching his name in history, they were well within their rights to thank their wonderful fans. It may not have been much of a contest out in the middle but this was still a significant Test match.

On 11 June 1890 a column of three hundred colonialists crossed the Shashe River to begin the annexation of Mashonaland on behalf of Cecil Rhodes’ British South Africa Company. They brought cattle, horses and wagons, rifles, revolvers and field guns, a searchlight, a steam engine, tents, food and water. Each man carried a slouch hat, a spare shirt and pair of socks, a water bottle, a sewing kit, a belt, a bandolier, a hundred rounds of ammunition and a hand axe. And, of course, this being a very English endeavour, in among it all someone packed a bat and ball.

So the first game of cricket in what would become Zimbabwe was played just over a month later, on 16 August, between the Pioneer Column’s A Troop and B and C Troops, on a patch of land at Providential Pass at what would become Fort Victoria. Nobody knows who won. “Probably A Troop,” wrote one of the players in his memoirs 50 years later, since they had Monty Bowden, the England captain and Surrey wicketkeeper, playing for them. Within five years, the settlers were organising games between Bulawayo and Salisbury and within a decade, they had formed the Rhodesian Cricket Union.

It is the best testament to it that it survived – and thrived – despite being the colonialists’ sport. Today Zimbabwe are, as the mayor of Bulawayo, David Coltart, told the Guardian this week, “a passionately multiracial team” and their cricket “a wonderful projection of our country”.

This one, too. England took this game to the world and one of the great pleasures of following it is in watching the world bring it back to England. Zimbabwe are not a great cricket team, but they are a great cricket country and, after that painful first day, when their faltering bowling attack was flogged all around Trent Bridge by England’s patrician batters they have, in their way, taken over the rest of the Test by turning it into one long demonstration of their bloody-minded pride in the way they play the game.

It was there in Brian Bennett’s bullish century on the second day and the way he forced Ben Stokes to withdraw his slips. It was there again in the way Sean Williams set about England’s bowling during the 88 he made on the third morning.

The 38-year-old Williams won his first call-up to this team way back in 2004, as under-19s captain. His career was just coming together at the time Zimbabwean cricket was falling apart and here he was, 21 years later, playing his first, and most likely his last, Test in this country. It was a hell of an innings, full of crisp cuts, punishing pulls and swingeing sweeps. Williams is a fine batter, with a Test average of 44, and he played like a man who wanted to take his last chance to make the point.

The pride was there all around the ground, too. The Zimbabwe fans got louder as the game went on. They seemed to come in greater numbers every day and gave up their seats to seek each other out in the stands so they could dance, sing and chant in Shona: “Zimbabwe! Mai-Mwana!”

There are around 125,000 people in the Zimbabwean diaspora in Britain and a good number of them must have been here in Nottingham this week, in what felt like a happy refutation of Norman Tebbit’s old idea that you can measure the strength of a migrant’s love for their new country by whether or not they are cheering for it.

“It’s the love of the game that binds everyone here together, not which side they’re cheering for,” one of their cheerleaders told me. When it was all over, and Zimbabwe had lost by an innings and 45 runs, the team took a slow lap around the ground to thank the fans for all the support.

It was one of those defeats that somehow still contained plenty to celebrate and a reminder that Test cricket is not only about who wins and loses and that the value of a game played over multiple days is not just in the finish but what happens along the way.

It has been 22 years since England’s men played Zimbabwe in a Test and there are people in the sport who would be happy enough if it were 22 more before England played them again. The England and Wales Cricket Board paid Zimbabwe for this fixture, which was arranged to fill an empty slot in the its broadcast deal.

There is a lot of talk about splitting Test cricket into two separate divisions. Let the men who run the game have their way and cricket will turn into an endless summer of T20 contests between franchise teams, with Test cricket reduced to a sideshow, with series between England, India and Australia. Maybe the game would be wealthier that way, but not nearly so much so as it would be poorer for it, too.

Monaco’s place in Formula One history has long since been established but two little-known races from the principality 51 years ago remain etched in the memory of those who took part, when women blazing a trail in the male-dominated motor racing world took to the track in Monte Carlo.

Christine Beckers competed in the first Grand Prix Monte-Carlo Féminin on 26 May 1974 and now, at 81 is as irrepressibly enthused about racing as she was when she fell in love with the sport as a teenager.

“I lived my passion,” she says. “There’s no better way to live. Driving, I always felt that’s what I like the most in life. That’s where I’m happy. That’s where I forget everything else. Only having the best time.”

It is a philosophy she has long followed, determined not to be constrained by the attitude toward her gender of the time. “I have to admit that I think it helped me,” she says. “Because I was quite a nice girl, good looking, smiling, a bit crazy. So everybody was laughing at me but saying: ‘Why not? Why not? She’s so crazy, she could do something.’”

She did. The Belgian has embraced the sport her entire life. Last year she became the oldest driver to have taken to the wheel of an F1 car, the 1985 Arrows A8 lent to her by her compatriot Thierry Boutsen, which she drove at Zolder. She also raced competitively at Spa-Francorchamps in the same model of Alfa Romeo she had previously driven 50 years before.

After all this time she still vividly remembers the moment the sport captured her. “I was 14 and in 1958 my father took my brother and me to Francorchamps to see the Formula One Grand Prix I have a picture of me in a racing car that day and you can see in my eyes that I really decided I want to do that,” she says. “So I told everybody I was going to be a Formula One driver. I was just looking at the car and the sound of the motors and the atmosphere. I even liked the special oil they were using at that time and later on I wanted to do a perfume with it.”

But she also admits it was far from straightforward to even begin to achieve the dream. “I was very bad at learning to drive. Nobody wants to believe that, but I was very bad. All the family had to try together because there were no lessons at that time,” she recalls, with a hearty chuckle. “Then at 18 I quit school because at mathematics I was awful. So my father was very angry with me. He was crazy about a girl saying she wanted to be a racing driver and not having good results at school. But I never doubted, I really was sure I was going to be a very good racing driver.”

Her conversation as we discuss race in Monaco is peppered with the enthusiastic laughter of a competitor never happier than when discussing the sport they love. While the races she competed in at Monaco have previously been barely a footnote in racing history, the story of the 1974 and 1975 Ladies’ Monte-Carlo Grands Prix are among those collected in a new book, 100 Years of Women: Motorsport & Monaco.

The only women-specific support races at the Monaco GP were held before the main event and run over 15 laps. Being the 1970s the principality’s paper ran a picture of the drivers with the headline “Ces jolies filles demain sur le circuit pour le Premier Grand Prix Monte-Carlo Prix féminin” which roughly translates as “These pretty girls will be on the circuit tomorrow for the First Ladies’ Monte Carlo Grand Prix”. For the participants, who were racers as opposed to jolie filles, it was an important moment.

“All the girls were invited from everywhere in the world,” says Beckers. “Monaco is always very special, it’s like a dream. I knew that somebody who wins at Monaco is somebody very special. It was fantastic for me, even if it was a very small car and not many horsepower, I didn’t mind, because not many people can say: ‘I’ve been racing in Monaco.’”

The car was but a moderately souped-up version of the road-going Renault 5 and, as the press noted at the time, it was “comical” to have drivers at the top of their game in a ride designed for tootling around town. Beckers was a five-time Belgian women’s national champion at this point and that year she would also set a record alongside her teammate Yvette Fontaine as the first all-women team to win their class at the Le Mans 24 Hours.

At the time she was also racing under the mononym “Christine” – a rather amateur attempt to avoid her parents finding out– and while she cared little for the cars, she loved the chance to race on the streets of Monte Carlo.

“When you are racing, you are not really interested in the others. You are interested in who you can beat,” she says. “When you have your helmet on, you don’t know if it’s a girl or a man. You want to be first. So you are in a sort of other world. I knew the track, I’ve been walking on it; I was not afraid at all because the car was very slow. I was used to driving faster cars. But as it was in Monaco, it was not important.”

Beckers attended the traditional pre-race reception with Prince Rainier and Princess Grace and notes, with no little glee, the actor Elizabeth Taylor, too. However, in terms of the race she remains aggrieved that her “sort of friend” Marie-Claude Beaumont, with whom she had raced in rallies, proved ruthless.

The pair were on the front row of the grid in 1974. Beckers believed they had made an agreement to enter the first corner together but says Beaumont cut across her and took the lead, from which there was no chance of a comeback. “I had to follow her during the whole race and I finished second and that was awful,” she says.

The American driver Paula Murphy was also somewhat disarmed but in her case by the formal reception. “I kind of walk around the fringe of the room, and I’m gawking, and finally I sit down in a chair,” Murphy recalled in 1976. “The butler came over with a big silver tray. So, I had a champagne and smoked a cigarette. I thought: ‘Well, I’ve had my glass of champagne, and I’ve met them all.’” So she left.

“The next day Jackie Stewart got into the car and said: ‘Princess Grace was worried about you last night and she wanted to know what happened to you.’ Well, I thought it was a cocktail party – at least that’s what the man at the hotel desk had interpreted to me – and it turned out it was a dinner, and I had left before dinner.”

Beckers was invited to the race again in 1975 but was unable to compete because her car rolled in a pre-race practice. She went on to drive the Le Mans 24 four times, including in 1976 alongside Henri Pescarolo and Jean-Pierre Beltoise for the highly respected Inaltéra team and a year later for the same team she partnered with Lella Lombardi, still the only woman to score an F1 championship point, to take 11th in the vingt-quatre, which remains the highest finishing position for a female driver squad. She was the first woman to compete in the Paris-Dakar rally, drove the Daytona 24 Hours twice and competed at Daytona in Nascar.

It has been an extraordinary journey and one she has no intention of ending any time soon. “I’m so happy to live my dream. In Monaco I was realising every minute of it.I was saying to myself: ‘Here I am.’ The people who were saying I could never do it, well, you see, here I am.”

Lando Norris has long been aware that if he is to revitalise his Formula One world championship challenge he has to click with his McLaren car in qualifying. So his pole position for Sunday’s Monaco Grand Prix is a moment to savour, a performance he has been attempting to nail since claiming the No 1 spot at the season-opener in Australia.

On a circuit that rewards confidence and commitment like no other, Norris had both in spades for a mighty lap in the final seconds of qualifying, threading the needle on the streets of Monte Carlo to beat the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc into second place by 0.109 seconds and his teammate Oscar Piastri into third. Lewis Hamilton suffered a crash in FP3 and Ferrari were able to repair the damage from which he recovered to a strong fourth place. However after the session was concluded the British driver was given a three-place grid penalty for impeding Verstappen in Q1.

The pole is Norris’s first in Monaco and McLaren’s first here since Fernando Alonso took top spot in 2007. It was the perfect comeback after he felt frustrated with his early season form in qualifying. The British driver has struggled to adapt to this year’s McLaren, particularly over the single lap and has fallen behind Piastri in the title fight.

“I’ve been working to improve, to do a better job,” he said. “Today was probably the first time since Australia that I’ve really put it all together. It’s not like I’m driving quicker. I’m driving in a better way, in a smarter way but there’s been a lot of work that’s gone on.

“Even if it was pole in any other track, it probably would have been the pole that’s meant the most to me. It probably means even more that it’s in Monaco but more because of what’s happened over the last couple of months. It may not seem like a lot, but for me it’s quite a big thing.”

Norris has been insistent he remains confident and the team have been tuning the car to accommodate him better and now might hope he has shrugged off his qualifying hoodoo. Starting at the front of the grid is a chance for him to stage a comeback in a closely fought title race. Piastri leads the British driver by 13 points with Verstappen 22 points back in third.

However, the serious business of the weekend remains ahead and therein lies the rub for Norris, as Formula One is hoping that his fine lap will not presage another routine procession to victory. Certainly this year Monaco is something of a wild card. With the introduction of the mandatory use of three sets of tyres during the race, all drivers will have to take at least two pit stops in both wet or dry conditions.

The rule was introduced in an effort to improve the “sporting spectacle” with overtaking on the narrow track rendered all but impossible by the wide and heavy cars. It was instigated after an early red flag last season allowed a free tyre change, the drivers managing their rubber in a procession to the flag.

As is so often the case at Monaco, however, qualifying was an absorbing session that swung between the leading protagonists. In Q3, Norris and Piastri had claimed the top spots and Leclerc could not match them. For the final laps the McLarens once more went out early and Norris was again immense, taking the provisional pole by one hundredth of a second. The pair then stayed out for a cool down lap before going again.

Leclerc, however, was far from out of it, and seemed to have done enough only for Norris to snatch pole at the last gasp by a tenth of a second, in 1min 9.959sec.

Hamilton suffered a crash in FP3 but Ferrari were able to repair the damage and he recovered to a strong fourth place. But the British driver was given a three-place penalty for impeding Verstappen in Q1 after he was given incorrect information by Ferrari. Verstappen moves up to fourth from fifth.

In what was something of a disastrous afternoon for Mercedes, George Russell went out in Q2, losing power in the tunnel, leaving him in 14th. His teammate, Kimi Antonelli, had crashed out on his final run in Q3 and finished in 15th.

Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson were in sixth and ninth for Racing Bulls, Fernando Alonso seventh for Aston Martin, Esteban Ocon eighth for Haas and Alex Albon 10th for Williams. Carlos Sainz was in 11th for Williams, Yuki Tsunoda in 12th for Red Bull and Nico Hülkenberg 13th for Sauber.

Gabriel Bortoleto was in 16th for Sauber and Oliver Bearman in 17th for Haas but he will take a 10-place grid penalty for overtaking under a red-flag during second practice. Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto were in 18th and 20th for Alpine and Lance Stroll was in 19th for Aston Martin but has a one-place grid penalty for causing a collision with Leclerc in first practice and three further places for impeding during the session. With Bearman at the back of the grid, Stroll will still start from 19th.

We can tell ourselves something different but, the truth is, getting old is rubbish. There are various reasons for this but the main one is loss. The loss of vigour, the loss of mobility … the loss of hair. Most of all, though, it’s the loss of people.

There are loved ones – friends as well as family – who pass, and then there are those who you share a special moment with and never see again. And so it is that this piece is for David, his dad and his mate. The trio I knew for only a day but which happens to be one of the greatest days of my life.

Sunday marks the 20th anniversary of Liverpool’s Champions League victory over Milan in Istanbul, and of course it’s been that long. I mean, look at the state of me. Honestly, I was young once. Equally, it feels somewhat remarkable that two whole decades have passed since one of football’s most incredible games given how firmly recollections of what transpired before, during and after it remain lodged in the mind. An unforgettable occasion? You can say that again.

I nearly didn’t go. Working as a reporter for a local newspaper in north-west London at the time, I’d been sent to Newcastle on the Monday of that week for a mandatory two-day training course and, although possible, it felt impractical to do that and travel to Turkey for the match on Wednesday. Also, I felt pretty content with having been at the semi-final against Chelsea. Nothing could top that, surely? But the closer it came into view the more I knew I simply had to be there. So I got hold of a ticket, organised a flight and, on the back of a taxi dash from Heathrow airport to Luton airport late on Tuesday night, set off to see my boyhood club play their first European Cup final since 1985. Having landed early on Wednesday morning, I was exhausted but ecstatic. The right decision had definitely been made.

I travelled on my own – the lads I watch Liverpool with now were not lads I watched Liverpool with then – but knew I’d have company once out there. One of my colleagues at the Wembley Observer had a friend, also in his early 20s, who was going and said we’d get on. So that was the plan – to meet up with him in Istanbul. His name was David.

We came together in Taksim Square. Oh, Taksim Square. Ask any Liverpool supporter who was at the final and they will tell you about that patch in the centre of the city that become a red paradise many springs ago. Fans and flags everywhere, songs being sung, beers being drunk, all under a bright hot sun. And amid the throng was David, standing outside a Pizza Hut, with his dad and his mate.

We said hello and proceeded to spend the day together. And no, I can’t remember David’s dad’s or his mate’s name, which annoys me to this day. But I do remember they were incredibly welcoming and kind to this stranger who clearly hadn’t slept or showered for the best part of 24 hours, was carrying his belongings in a grey rucksack and was wearing a Liverpool shirt with ‘LFC 4 LIFE’ on the back. Talk about embarrassing.

We ate at the Pizza Hut, consumed cans of Efes, belted out La Bamba, and generally revelled in the majesty of it all. The sense of excitement and anticipation was tangible, you could feel it everywhere, and that I could share it all with such good people meant a lot. They owed me nothing but gave me everything.

It was almost a shame to leave for the Ataturk Stadium but we knew we had to and well in advance of kick-off given it was miles away. So one of the buses put on for supporters was boarded around 6pm local time, but only after David’s mate and I had a picture taken with two Turkish police officers we’d been chatting to. I can’t remember their names either, but they were sound, and it remains one of my favourite photographs.

The journey to the ground indeed took ages but it, too, was great. Reds packed in shoulder to shoulder, singing and drinking some more, receiving thumbs-up and applause from locals and, in an era before smartphones, truly living in the moment. If memory serves, it was during this time that I got to know David properly. My colleague was right – he was ace.

After the best part of two hours we finally arrived at the Ataturk, which initially appeared to be a broken spaceship abandoned in the desert. A vast, curved bowl, split in two, sitting on barren land. There may have been people here once but now they were gone, and suddenly a great day had become a bit weird. But no matter. The hoards hopped off the buses and merrily walked to their final destination.

It was at this point that I said goodbye to David, his dad and his mate. They were in a different stand. Hugs and handshakes were exchanged as I thanked them for keeping me company. They said it had been their pleasure; it had been mine too, and the plan was to meet up again at full-time. For various reasons that never happened and we probably knew that would be the case.

The match itself? What’s there to say? I know the story, you know the story, the football Gods know the story, largely because they wrote it. The comeback, victory and trophy lift aside, I have two abiding memories: passing Diego Maradona on the stairs as I walked to my seat and staying there at half-time as others around me left. Like them I didn’t believe but, unlike them, I had no intention of abandoning my team. I sang You’ll Never Walk Alone with everyone else who had remained and hoped our loyalty would be rewarded with a goal. We got so much more.

There’s a question I like to throw at fellow Reds: name the team – players and their positions – that started in Istanbul. Everyone I’ve asked has struggled to remember, which never stops being funny and also strikes at the heart of what took place that night, namely an unremarkable Liverpool side triumphing in remarkable circumstances. Hence why, 20 years on, that final retains a mystical, mythical, miraculous quality for many of those who witnessed it.

That is certainly the case for me and, more than anything, I feel hugely fortunate to have been there. The match was one thing; the rest of the day was another, and for that I continue to be grateful to David, his dad and his mate. Life’s inevitabilities mean we never met again, which is a great shame. But we’ll always have Wednesday 25 May 2005. We’ll always have Istanbul.

Hence why, 20 years on, that final retains a mystical, mythical, miraculous quality for many of those who witnessed it.

That is certainly the case for me and, more than anything, I feel hugely fortunate to have been there. The match was one thing; the rest of the day was another, and for that I continue to be grateful to David, his dad and his mate. Life’s inevitabilities mean we never met again, which is a great shame. But we’ll always have Wednesday 25 May 2005. We’ll always have Istanbul.

Régis Le Bris said the 19-year-old Tommy Watson’s dramatic stoppage-time winner to clinch Sunderland’s promotion to the Premier League encapsulated a rollercoaster season and suggested team spirit will be key if they are to cope with the step up next season. The French head coach masterminded Sunderland’s return to the top flight after eight years in his first season at the club.

Watson, a 73rd-minute substitute, scored in the fifth minute of added time to complete a dream comeback victory after Eliezer Mayenda cancelled out Tyrese Campbell’s well-taken opener. Watson, who joined Sunderland aged eight, will move to Brighton next month after the clubs agreed a £10m deal in April, but the forward gave his boyhood club the perfect parting gift. “We’ll see each other in the Premier League next year, in the big time,” Watson said.

The finale brought more joyous scenes for Sunderland, who had reached Wembley thanks to Dan Ballard’s header in the final minute of extra time in their semi-final second-leg victory over Coventry, but playoff agony for Sheffield United. “At the end this game is a good example of the season,” Le Bris said. “Emotionally, it’s impressive … The end of the second leg was absolutely crazy. It was the case again, to create this connection, this emotion, these memories for the fans and for us. We need to live these tough moments and it will be really important in my life.”

Sunderland finished 16th in the division last season and a young side – on average they fielded the youngest team in the Championship this campaign – triumphed despite falling behind to Campbell’s strike at Wembley. “We showed a strong character even when we are not dominant, even when we struggle as a squad,” said the former Lorient manager. “We stayed connected, we stuck to our plan and maybe later in the game we found an opportunity to change the momentum.”

One of Sunderland’s stars, the 19-year-old Jobe Bellingham, is the subject of strong interest from Borussia Dortmund, while the 17-year-old Chris Rigg also has outside admirers, but Le Bris stressed it is a team game. “We need to remember that the connection between players is often more important than the talent of one player,” he said. “For me as a manager and in football in general sometimes we forget that it is a collective sport and effort. We tend to focus on one talent but it’s not the main point, it’s about the way we work together.”

A deflated Chris Wilder, a boyhood Blades fan who was in the crowd when United were beaten in the playoffs by Wolves and Burnley in 2003 and 2009 respectively, conceded defeat was a bitter blow. “We had an opportunity to change the narrative around the playoffs and we’ve not taken it,” the United manager said.

Wilder also questioned the use of the video assistant referee system, which was influential in disallowing Harrison Burrows’ volley at 1-0, when the offside Vinícius Souza was deemed to have interfered with the view of Anthony Patterson in Sunderland’s goal. “We play 46 games, two playoff games and all of a sudden it’s a subjective decision by the referee,” he said. “I don’t think the goalkeeper saves it, I don’t think he gets anywhere near it. I thought it gave them a lifeline with some real energy.”

Wilder said the manner of Sunderland’s goals was painful from his perspective. “We don’t secure the ball at the top of the pitch, the middle of the park is wide open and it’s amazing what the stories bring up, a local lad who is on his way to Brighton counters and finds a fabulous position and a finish and then the game has gone past us, it’s 97, 98 minutes, so fairytale stuff for the boy and Sunderland,” Wilder said. “For us, it’s going to take quite a while to get over it.”

Novak Djokovic claimed his long-awaited 100th title after producing a spectacular comeback to defeat Hubert Hurkacz 5-7, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (2) in a three-hour, five-minute battle at the Geneva Open final. “Incredible match,” he said. “Seven-six in the third with a full stadium, beautiful atmosphere. I’m just grateful to clinch the 100th here.”

Djokovic becomes the third man in the open era to reach the landmark achieved by Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103). He isthe first to win titles in 20 seasons.

It marks Djokovic’s first title since his triumph at the Paris Olympics last year. He had two previous opportunities to become a centurion, losing tough matches to Jannik Sinner in the final of the Shanghai Masters last October and Jakub Mensik in the Miami Open final in March.

Djokovic entered the Geneva Open, an ATP 250 event, at late notice as a wildcard after struggling throughout the clay court season with opening-round losses at the Monte Carlo Masters and the Madrid Open. After his defeat to Matteo Arnaldi in Spain, his third in a row, the 38-year-old pulled out of the Italian Open and ended his partnership with Andy Murray.

Although he found some form and rhythm in Geneva, Djokovic was second-best for much of the final, narrowly losing the first set before trailing by a break from early the deciding set against Hurkacz. At 4-2 to Hurkacz in set three, the big-serving Pole had not lost a point on serve in the set. As the pressure mounted, and Hurkacz’s forehand crumbled, Djokovic turned the match around before closing out an emphatic final-set tiebreak.

Instead of celebrating another stellar achievement, Djokovic will have to immediately shift his focus to the French Open, which begins on Sunday. He will face Mackenzie McDonald of the United States in the first round, a match that is unlikely to take place until Tuesday. He must recover well physically after a hard week.

Meanwhile, Emma Raducanu says she is working hard to regain full fitness in time for her first-round match in Paris after struggling with back spasms at the Strasbourg Open against Danielle Collins. “It’s not feeling 100%,” she said. “I had a spasm in Strasbourg and just been trying to manage it as best I can doing treatment. I’ve been on the practice court last night and this morning. It felt OK, but it’s different playing a match. I’m trying to do everything to get up to speed as fast as possible.”

On Friday, Raducanu said this injury was similar to the back injury that sidelined during the off-season in December. “I would say the one before Australia was worse,” said Raducanu. “This one I caught before it fully locked up.

“The treatment is a lot with the physios, a lot of it with heat. Been doing some needling. At the start of the year I was so scared of needles. It was my biggest phobia. That was the only way I was going to be able to play Australia. Since then, I’ve been dipping my toes into it because I know it helps even though I’m really scared of them.”

Anthony Edwards was determined to keep Minnesota’s spirits up, from the flight home after a frustrating trip to Oklahoma City into a crucial game in these Western Conference finals.

Positive energy is never hard for him to find.

Edwards had 30 points, nine rebounds and six assists in just three quarters for the Timberwolves in a 143-101 victory on Saturday night in Game 3 that cut the Thunder’s lead in the series to 2-1.

“Just ultimate pressure on the ball,” Edwards said, “and shoot it as much as I can.”

Julius Randle added 24 points and rookie Terrence Shannon Jr had 15 points in 13 minutes to highlight a big boost from the bench for the Wolves, who caused all kinds of cracks in the Thunder’s NBA-best defense after struggling to solve it in the two lopsided losses on the road.

“Their force on that end of the floor was better than our physicality and pressure, things that we typically do well,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had just 14 points on 4-for-13 shooting with four turnovers, subbed out with a 38-point deficit and 4:25 to go in the third quarter as Daigneault conceded on a night when his team was never closer than 22 points after early in the second quarter.

“It felt like we just eased into the game, and they didn’t,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “They blitzed us pretty early, and then we were never able to get back because of it.”

Game 4 is in Minneapolis on Monday night.

The travel north and venue shift triggered a sharp drop in shooting for the Thunder, who made exactly half of their attempts from the floor over the first two games and went just 12 for 40 in the first half on Saturday.

Gilgeous-Alexander, the newly minted NBA MVP, went more than 13 minutes of game time between baskets while the Target Center crowd loudly booed him on every touch and taunted him at the line with the chant, “Free throw merchant!” in a nod to the popular notion he draws an inordinate amount of fouls.

Randle, who had his first off night of this postseason in a Game 2 performance so disjointed he was benched for the fourth quarter, had his fire back — and his signature fadeaway.

Edwards rediscovered his three-point shot, going 5 for 8 after shooting just 1 of 9 in Game 2. He gave the quick-handed, ball-pressuring Thunder a taste of what it’s like to play against themselves with a couple of relentless pursuits of loose balls he turned into breakaway dunks.

Outscored 69-37 in the third quarter over the first two games, the Wolves made sure to avoid another post-halftime malaise. Edwards, tightly guarded by Isaiah Joe in the corner, found enough space to drive along the baseline and spin an up-and-under reverse layup off the glass for a 79-52 lead.

“That’s what we need him to do, and when he does it, it takes us to another level,” coach Chris Finch said.

I have seen images on my phone screen these past months that will haunt me as long as I live. Dead, injured, starving children and babies. Children crying in pain and in fear for their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers. A small boy shaking in terror from the trauma of an airstrike. Scenes of unspeakable horror and violence that have left me feeling sick. Sometimes I skip over these photos and videos, afraid perhaps of what I will see next. But more often than not, I feel compelled to bear witness.

I know I am not alone. So many of us, privileged in our comfort and safety, have watched the suffering of the children of Gaza through social media, images mixed in jarringly with ads and memes and pictures of other people’s children, smiling and safe. It renders the horror even more immediate: these could be your kids, or mine, or any kid you know, but for the lottery of birth.

Many thousands of people have used their voice to speak up for these children and their families, whether in writing to politicians, making donations to charities and aid organisations, or taking to the streets. Yet this war on children continues, and there is an overwhelming sense of powerlessness to help them. It is hard to imagine how it can get any worse, but worse it gets with news this week that 14,000 babies are suffering from severe acute malnutrition, according to the UN. The reason is deliberate starvation: famine as a weapon of war or, as Human Rights Watch puts it, a “tool of extermination”.

This overarching sense of impotence when confronted with unimaginable horror is creating a mass sense of moral injury – a form of profound psychological distress that can happen to people when they are forced to act, or indeed not act, in ways that are in direct opposition to their values or moral code. I first came across the term when speaking to medical professionals who were developing PTSD during the pandemic. Doctors, nurses and care workers were in anguish at not always being able to provide treatment to patients who so desperately needed it, owing to a lack of equipment, resources and leadership, and the sheer volume of seriously ill people.

Nowhere will this kind of distress be more keenly felt than in Gaza itself. For the medical professionals and aid workers there, sadness, guilt, betrayal, even, that you can’t help everyone must be a daily reality. When it is your job to help, to feed, to treat, being unable to do so is a profound trauma.

And for Gaza’s parents it must be torture of the most excruciating degree to see your child crying in hunger and be unable to feed them. I often think of the babies who were in the neonatal intensive care unit under bombardment – that photograph of the newborns in al-Shifa hospital laid seven to a bed to keep them warm and alive. I wonder about their mothers, many of whom will have been forced to give birth without proper pain relief and equipment. Where are they now? How many of them survived? And what did that do to the medics who tried so hard to save them?

But I have also started to wonder about the impact of moral injury by proxy and at scale. I am in no way putting it on a par with what people on the ground are experiencing. But that feeling of powerlessness and, as an extension, complicity: what does it do to those around the world who feel what is happening is wrong? What is the impact of witnessing so much profound suffering – even through a screen – and feeling unable to act or to force others to act?

I now understand why my mother stopped watching the news after I was born. It was because she couldn’t bear it. I too have felt a temptation to look inwards since having my son, to cocoon us in the warmth and safety of our privileged lives. But the internet means it’s more difficult to detach – the news runs in continuous parallel to our lives, eroding borders. There have been many nights when I have put my son to bed, his belly full, his pyjamas clean and soft, and I have cried silently for these other children who are not being tucked up in warm beds. In the early hours when he would wake for milk, all I had to do was go to the fridge and pour him some, and we would sit, listening not to the sounds of bombs but to the birdsong that seemed to fill the skies.

The contrast between his safety and their peril feels to me obscene. Could that be a kind of moral injury? There is something about being in the daily company of a little person – their innocence, their vulnerability, their silliness, their loving nature – that makes the pain of any other child feel like a profound affront. But I know you don’t have to be a parent to feel horror at what is being inflicted on Gaza’s children in the most visceral way. I believe – or at least I used to – that it is ingrained in us, as humans, to feel a collective responsibility towards children, and that this collective responsibility can extend beyond borders.

Feeling powerless in the face of such egregious injustice can result in a loss of trust or faith, not just in governments and institutions but also in the moral order of the world, and its ability to protect children. I wonder what the impact of this will be: will it, as certain politicians no doubt hope, result in a numbness that presents as indifference? Traumatic events can result in a lack of affect – millions more people should be marching and raising their voice – but they can also be channelled into righteous anger.

I certainly feel a profound loss of faith. Something I felt to be true about humanity – that people are fundamentally good, that we owe it to children to protect them – has shifted because of this conflict. I walk around with a feeling of heaviness that I cannot seem to shake. Thousands of miles from Gaza, I am changed by the past 18 months. I have learned that, for some people, compassion for children has political limits. What does one do with that terrible knowledge once it sits inside you like a leaden stone? I don’t seem be able to find an answer.

Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist

It has been five years since George Floyd, a Black man who lived in Minneapolis, was murdered by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. The killing, captured in a distressing 10-minute video that quickly flooded social media timelines, sparked something that felt like an international revolution: protests took place across the world, forcing countries and cities to reckon with their present and historical treatment of Black people.

In Britain, protests reached fever pitch when activists in Bristol toppled a statue of Edward Colston, the slave trader and deputy governor of the Royal African Company, and hurled it into the harbour. Bristol, once a major slave-trading port, had maintained a veneration of Colston that was increasingly divisive. The statue in particular had been a key focus of tensions: attempts to add a second plaque acknowledging Colston’s role in the slave trade were frustrated in 2018. For many Bristolians, the direct action provided a moment of long-overdue relief.

Colston now resides, supine, inside the city’s M Shed museum. Visiting earlier this month, I felt that this had been a worthy outcome: he no longer towers over Bristolians in a kind of psychological domination, yet nor has he simply been made invisible. The statue has been historicised within that specific moment in 2020 and contextualised against a timeline of Bristol’s connections with transatlantic slavery. It is one of the key successes of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.

But five years on, the bigger questions still remain. What are the real, felt consequences of that moment? Speaking to people visiting Colston, I asked a 70-year-old white man called David, who has lived in Bristol since 2011, if he felt that the toppling and the Black Lives Matter movement had made a real difference to the city. He told me that there is “a lot more to be done to change the way people think”, and then informed me that, about half a mile away, outside Colston’s former plinth, was a hard-right demonstration organised by the UK Independence party. They were calling for mass deportations and lamenting the supposed “destruction” of the city by “far-left thugs”. I went to check it out.

Though they were outnumbered by counter-protesters, the hard-right protesters were there – making grimly visible that there is clearly still a battle under way for the heart, soul and mind of this country. Yemi, a 22-year-old counter-protester carrying a Jamaican flag, told me: “I actually think the BLM protests fuelled even more hate on their side – because they saw how many people were against racism and Colston, it caused more hate in them and they felt more entitled to protest. So I don’t think much has changed.” She also thought that the statue should have been left in the water. “The harbour is where they brought us in from. I thought it was very fitting for it to stay there.”

It is easy to look back at 2020 and feel fascinated, aggrieved, even fooled. I find it quite strange to reflect on. The murder of an African American man led to a kind of “gold rush” in Britain and in the US, where, particularly in the cultural sector, money and opportunities were handed to Black people as an apology for decades of neglect and underinvestment.

Many of these gains and commitments have petered out. In the US, the Black portraiture “boom” of 2020 has come to a screeching halt, with Black art now going unsold. In the UK, the number of Black writers publishing books has plummeted since 2020. While dispiriting, this could have been foreseen, considering how opportunistic and cynical the industry can be. A Black man named Patrick Hutchinson landed a book deal simply for having carried a far-right protester over his shoulder. There were only 152 days between the event and the book’s publication. I have not heard much from Patrick since then. You can buy the book for £2.15 on Amazon.

Much of the response also became unfocused to the point of parody and distraction. Politicians “taking the knee” became an internet meme. The removal of episodes from shows such as The Mighty Boosh and The Dukes of Hazzard from streaming platforms was an overreaction that most activists did not ask for, and seemed to take oxygen out of the movement.

Disputes over pop culture began to obscure the target of the protests: police violence, and how it disproportionately affects Black people in the US, the UK and all over the world. Five years on, this problem is still very much with us.

In March, Julian Cole, who had been in a minimal conscious state after being violently arrested by Bedfordshire police officers in May 2013, died in hospital at the age of 31. To date, the Crown Prosecution Service has not brought charges against the officers responsible, citing a lack of evidence. In 2022, it was revealed that, two years previously, a 15-year-old Black school girl in Hackney, Child Q, had been strip-searched by police and that racism was likely a contributing factor. The disciplinary hearing for a gross misconduct case has been delayed until this year. Last year, there was indignation after Metropolitan police officer Martyn Blake was acquitted of the murder of an unarmed Black man, Chris Kaba, who he shot dead in 2022. (Blake is set to face a gross misconduct hearing.)

Meanwhile, any progress made since 2020 to address the institutional racism of police forces in Britain has come under significant political pressure. Campaigners have been frustrated at the stalling of police reform, with Black-led organisations at a Stephen Lawrence Day conference calling on the government to complete a follow-up to the 2023 Casey report, to set about a real transformation of the force. There has also been a sinister inversion of reality after last summer’s “race riots”: the swift justice response led to the myth of “two-tier policing”, suggesting that police are more heavy-handed with white, far-right protesters, despite actual evidence of bias against young Black people. It’s easy to forget but the Colston Four, who toppled the statue, were subject to a gruelling two-year legal battle (they were acquitted by a jury of criminal damage).

But there have been wins and changes, and there is cause for hope. The dynamic of an uprising quickly reaching its peak before petering out and even triggering a backlash can feel disappointing. But it is typical for the course of history that great moments of social upheaval are eventually cannibalised or absorbed into a status quo, with participants left feeling thwarted, or even sheepish about their optimism. As my Guardian colleague Nesrine Malik wrote of the perceived failure of the Arab spring: “What the Arab spring came up against was a universal conundrum – how to convert the forces that demand equality into those that deliver it.”

The muscle memory of those protests was certainly built on to the benefit of mobilising pro-Palestinian marches across the country in the wake of the onslaught against Gaza. And longer-term projects are unfolding – BLM UK’s investment of £350,000 into funding Black-led organisations is a real success, while several organisations that had historically profited from enslavement pledged reparatory action in the wake of Colston’s toppling, including the Guardian, with its Legacies of Enslavement programme.

At M Shed in Bristol too, I was reminded of the importance of planting those small seeds of change. A small white child walking out of the museum asked his mother what “I can’t breathe” meant, as he read it on one of the placards surrounding Colston. His mother began to calmly explain everything that happened in 2020. We might lament the lack of true progress in racial justice, but we can be confident that a blueprint for education, resistance and mobilisation has been established by that moment. Next time, and there will be a next time, we will be better primed to go. With the challenge of a surging global right, it will be more urgent than ever to retain focus and not repeat mistakes.

The Fox News-approved guide to being a man

Tim Burchett, a Republican representative, would like you to know that he is not a straw man. No sir. Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, the Tennessee lawmaker explained that he is a red-blooded American male who does not “drink out of a straw” because “that’s what the women in my house do”. And no self-respecting man wants to be like the women in their house, do they? Yuck.

Why did Burchett feel the need to tell us all what he likes to put in his mouth? Because the Fox News host Jesse Watters has some very strange ideas about masculinity and, back in March, came up with “rules for men”. These include: don’t drink soup in public, don’t cross your legs, don’t drink from a straw (it makes your lips purse in an “effeminate” manner), don’t drink milkshakes and “don’t wave simultaneously with two hands”.

The Fox News host is so proud of these rules that he now has his producer running around Washington DC asking lawmakers their thoughts on Watters’ guide to masculinity. Burchett, as we’ve seen, is fully on board. So is the Missouri senator Josh Hawley, who has written a book called Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs.

Meanwhile, in a stunning example of ClickHole’s “The Worst Person You Know Just Made A Great Point” meme, Ted Cruz seemed a little more dubious. “Jesse Watters has rules for men,” Watters’ producer told Cruz. “He said men should not have male best friends. What do you think?” Cruz replied: “Jesse needs a friend.” I think he needs a lot more than that.

Watters has said his rules for men are just a bit of fun. But it all starts to become a little less funny when you look at the massive impact Fox has on the US, and how influential Watters himself is. More than 4 million people tune into Watters’ primetime show and the man is constantly reinforcing toxic ideas about gender. Watters, for example, has suggested that he doesn’t really think fathers are responsible for raising their daughters. “When you raise a son, you are responsible for that son,” Watters said last year. “It’s not like raising a daughter, it’s different.” He’s also denigrated fathers who leave work early to spend time with their children.

Watters, who is on his second marriage, to a much younger woman who was an associate producer on his show at Fox News, also has some very disturbing ideas about how to approach women. Want to know how he courted his second wife? He’s boasted on TV that he let the air out of her car tires. “She couldn’t go anywhere. She needed a lift. I said: ‘Hey, you need a lift?’ She hopped right in the car,” Watters laughed. (He later claimed it was a joke.) By the way, Watters was still married at the time. Fox News likes to style itself as a paragon of family values, but these are the values it promotes.

Again: Watters isn’t just some kook with a niche show. A large body of research shows that Fox News shapes American politics. There is a direct line between the misogyny and rigid gender roles amplified on Fox News and laws that treat women as nothing more than incubators and walking wombs. There’s a direct line between the sort of attitude towards women that Watters espouses and the fact that a brain dead woman in Georgia is being kept alive to carry out her pregnancy because of the state’s abortion ban. Watters may say his rules for men are just a bit of fun, but his viewers are gulping it all down. Obviously without a straw.

Pregnant news anchor stays on air during labor

It’s funny how Watters seems to think “effeminate” is a slur when you’ve got women like the local news co-anchor Olivia Jaquith calmly delivering her newscast even after her labor contractions began. “I’m happy to be here and I’ll stay on the desk for as long as I possibly can,” Jaquith said. “But if I disappear, that’s what’s going on.”

Number of US white nationalist groups falls as their views go mainstream

A new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center found a 5% drop in hate and extremist groups in 2024. The Guardian reports that this “can be attributed to the fact that many feel a lesser sense of urgency to organize, because their beliefs have infiltrated politics, education and society in general”.

Professional boxer dies at 25 after saying doctors ignored her pain

The British boxer Georgia O’Connor has died after being diagnosed with cancer in January. In an Instagram post shared earlier this year, O’Connor said her pain and concerns about her health had been dismissed. “Not one doctor took me seriously. Not one doctor did the scans or blood tests I begged for whilst crying on the floor in agony,” O’Connor wrote. “Instead, they dismissed me. They gaslit me, told me it was nothing, made me feel like I was overreacting … They REFUSED to listen. One even told me that it’s ‘all in my head.’ And now? Now the cancer has spread.” Studies have shown that women’s pain is often underestimated by doctors.

Leading genocide experts are unequivocal that what is happening in Gaza is genocide

Earlier this week I published a piece asking: “What did you do during the genocide in Gaza?” I received some heartwarming responses from readers (thank you!) but also snarky comments denying that a genocide is taking place. I want to stress that I’m not just throwing a serious word around for the fun of it; multiple leading experts on genocide have said that this is the majority opinion. “Can I name someone whose work I respect who doesn’t consider it genocide?” said Raz Segal, an Israeli genocide researcher based in the US. “No.”

Read my investigation into the mysterious disappearance of Susan Walsh

In July 1996, Susan Walsh, a 36-year-old freelance writer and sex worker, left her house in New Jersey to make a phone call. She never came back. Walsh is presumed dead but neither her body nor her killer have been found – in part because of institutional misogyny. I’ve been looking into Walsh’s disappearance for five years and, on behalf of her half-brother, successfully sued the Nutley, New Jersey, police to get the records released.

The week in pawtriarchy

It is legal to own a pet kangaroo in Colorado, but it is probably not a good idea. The Guardian notes that a “roo-peat offender” called Irwin recently escaped for the second time in Durango, Colorado. Eventually the police came up with a “kanga-ruse” to catch him and he jumped into the arms of a “big farm boy” officer. Since Irwin has been sent back to somewhere he seems to want to leave, I’m not sure if this is a hoppy ending.

The killing of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC on Wednesday night is unconscionable. The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, should be alive, and justice must be meted out to their assailant. This brazen act of political violence in the heart of the nation’s capital only underscores the obvious: all this violence – whether it’s in Washington DC, Gaza, Jenin or Israel, and whether it’s by bullet, bomb or forced starvation – all of it must end, and it must end immediately.

What we know so far is that shortly after 9pm on Wednesday evening, a gunman approached a group of four people who were departing an event at the Capital Jewish Museum that had been hosted by the American Jewish Committee. (It’s been reported that the event “focused on bringing humanitarian aid to Gaza through Israeli-Palestinian and regional collaboration”.) The suspected gunman, identified in media accounts as 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, had been seen pacing outside the museum when he spotted the group of four leaving the building. He opened fire on the group, fatally wounding two at close range. He then entered the building, where he was detained by event security. He can be seen on video in handcuffs and chanting “free, free Palestine”.

Needless to say, criminal actions such as this reprehensible murder do not advance the cause of Palestinian liberation or anyone’s freedom. This stupid and horrific act must be opposed not only for its immorality but also because the world needs to focus on pressuring Israel to end its blockade of Gaza and allow the flow of humanitarian aid into the besieged territory before tens of thousands of Palestinians – including 14,000 babies, according to the United Nations – die from forced starvation in the coming days.

Already, the Israeli government is using the murder to wag its finger at Israel’s critics and deflect from its own actions. In a press conference in Jerusalem, Gideon Sa’ar, the Israeli foreign minister, blamed “leaders and officials of many countries and international organizations, especially from Europe” for inciting violence against Israel, incitement which he said led “in a direct line … to this murder”.

Millions are stating their loud opposition to Israeli actions without resorting to murderous political violence. In fact, that’s exactly what we must do

The idea that European leaders are directly responsible for this heinous murder is nothing short of ridiculous, of course. But it does show how nervous the Israeli government is about a new wave of criticism being directed against its assault on Gaza. Earlier, on 21 May, the UK development minister, Jenny Chapman, told the BBC that Israel is “using hunger as a weapon of war” in Gaza. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, also called Israel’s planned military escalation in Gaza “morally unjustifiable, wholly disproportionate and utterly counterproductive”, and Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, recently stated that Britain “cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve” and that levels of suffering in Gaza were “utterly intolerable”.

In addition, the UK has suspended free trade talks with Israel, and EU foreign ministers are reviewing the European Union’s trade agreement with Israel over its blockading of food, water, medicine and other needed supplies for Gazans’ survival. While these actions are welcome, they’re also a case of too little, too late. And despite a partial UK arms embargo on Israel, the UK government still approved licenses for £127.6m of military equipment to Israel, more than the combined total for 2020-23, according to the group Campaign Against the Arms Trade.

In other words, the violence is intensifying, enabled in part because those who arm Israel continue to do so. It’s also expanding, and not just on to the streets of Washington DC. Consider what happened on the same day as the tragic killing of the Israeli embassy staffers. A delegation of diplomats representing 31 countries were on an official mission to observe the humanitarian situation in the West Bank city of Jenin, which has also been under sustained assault by Israel for the last 120 days. The Israeli military shot towards the delegation of diplomats, and later claimed the group had “deviated from the approved route”.

Once upon a time, to be a diplomat meant you were afforded a certain amount of security, but those were times when we, perhaps naively, believed there were rules governing warfare. What do we have now? Shots fired as diplomats carry out their jobs. Food used as a weapon of war. Young embassy staffers assassinated in public.

This killing must end. We all know it, just as we know that it must start with an immediate and permanent ceasefire, the return of all captives taken on 7 October and after, and the full resumption of aid into Gaza. The details of what happens in the medium and long term, for both Israelis and Palestinians, can and must be forged through honest dialogue and not by the mass displacement and extermination of the Palestinian people.

But rather than heeding this lesson, we will likely witness in the days ahead an all-out push to discredit those who oppose Israel’s military campaign, which has been labeled a genocide by multiple international human rights organizations, among many others. Israel’s foreign minister has already started. In his press conference, Sa’ar claimed that it was the talk that Israel is committing “genocide, crimes against humanity and murdering babies” that “pave[s] the way exactly for such murders” as happened in Washington DC.

But genocide, crimes against humanity and babies being killed are all happening, and millions are stating their loud opposition to Israeli actions without resorting to murderous political violence. In fact, that’s exactly what we must do, and we must do that now, louder and stronger than ever, before this violence grows and spreads further, consuming even more innocent lives in its monstrous path.

CNN —

President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs have given many Americans whiplash. The list of companies announcing price changes as a result is equally daunting.

Among the levies Trump has imposed is a 10% baseline tariff for most imports and a 30% tariff on most Chinese goods. Some goods, such as steel and aluminum, face higher rates.

Many retailers have issued warnings that they won’t, as Trump has suggested, “eat” the additional costs caused by those import taxes. That means anything from groceries and clothing to toys and cars could cost Americans more.

Walmart is one of the latest major retailers to say it would sell more expensive goods soon because Trump’s tariffs are “too high.” Other retailers suggesting they could hike prices soon include Ford, Best Buy and others.

Here are some of the companies that could raise prices on everyday items – whether or not companies are directly blaming Trump’s tariffs.

Walmart

Walmart said on April 15 it would increase prices because Trump’s tariffs were “too high,” particularly when it came to products made in China.

“We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon said in an earnings call.

Price changes at Walmart will likely take effect by the end of May and prices will increase “much more” in June, the company’s chief financial officer John David Rainey, told CNBC.

Mattel

On May 6, toy manufacturing giant Mattel said that it would raise prices due to tariffs. Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz told investors that “under the current scenarios we are considering” in response to tariffs, he expects 40% to 50% of its products to remain priced at $20 or less. However, he also advocated for zero tariffs on toys and games around the world.

Trump threatened Mattel, saying he would “put a 100% tariff on his toys, and he won’t sell one toy in the United States, and that’s their biggest market.”

Best Buy

Electronics retailer Best Buy warned during a March earnings call that “vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.”

Some electronic components and devices are temporarily exempt from Trump’s tariffs. That won’t last forever.

Nintendo, for instance, delayed the pre-order date for its Switch 2 video game console because of concerns regarding tariffs. The company later said pricing for the console won’t change from the initial $450, but the accessories “will experience price adjustments from those announced on April 2 due to changes in market conditions.” The same could happen to any product because of “market conditions,” the company noted.

Meanwhile, Lin Tao, CFO of PlayStation maker Sony, said “we may pass on the price” during an earnings call.

Shein and Temu

Chinese retailers Shein and Temu were once largely exempt from tariffs because of the “de minimis” exemption, which spared shipments of goods worth less than $800. But Trump signed an executive order getting rid of the exemption.

“Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up. To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustment starting April 25, 2025,” Temu wrote in a notice similar to an announcement Shein made.

Both companies have since raised prices on some products. For instance, two patio chairs listed on Temu and reviewed by CNN had a $61.72 price tag on April 24. The next day, when the pricing changes took effect, they were listed at $70.17. On Shein, CNN noted a bathing suit set cost $4.39. The next day, it cost $8.39, a 91% increase.

Ford and Subaru

Imported cars were hit with a 25% tariff and most auto parts face a similar duty, although some automakers can request partial refunds — for now.

Ford’s CFO Sherry House said it expects to raise its US car prices as much as 1.5% in the second half of 2025 due to tariffs.

The carmaker extended its “employee pricing” offer through July as consumers rushed to buy cars ahead of Trump’s tariffs.

Japanese automaker Subaru has also said it will increase US prices to “offset increased costs,” citing “current market conditions.” Subaru did not specify how much prices could increase.

“The changes were made to offset increased costs while maintaining a solid value proposition for the customer,” a Subaru of America spokesperson said in a statement. “Subaru pricing is not based on the country of origin of its products.”

Procter & Gamble, Stanley Black & Decker

Household product maker Procter & Gamble, which owns brands like Pampers, Tide and Charmin, said during an earnings call on April 24 it would consider raising prices in some categories and markets.

That same day, CEO Jon Moeller told CNBC that “there will likely” be price increases for consumers because “tariffs are inherently inflationary.”

In April, Stanley Black & Decker, which owns power tool brands, raised prices by an average of high single-digits because of tariffs. Another round of price increases will come later this year.

Adidas

Adidas said higher costs are likely for products in the US due to Trump’s back-and-forth tariff.

“Given the uncertainty around the negotiations between the US and the different exporting countries, we do not know what the final tariffs will be,” Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden said in an earnings release on April 29.

He added that “cost increases due to higher tariffs will eventually cause price increases.”

President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, citing a lack of progress in current trade negotiations.

“Their powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies, and more, have led to a Trade Deficit with the U.S. of more than $250,000,000 a year, a number which is totally unacceptable,” he wrote in a Truth Social post Friday morning.

“Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump wrote.

“Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.”

But later Friday, at an executive order signing in the Oval Office, Trump escalated his message to the EU.

“I’m not looking for a deal,” he said. “We’ve set the deal — it’s at 50%.”

Trump opened the door to pushing his June 1 deadline further, saying, “If somebody comes in and wants to build a plant here, I can talk to them about a little bit of a delay.”

After a phone call with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Maroš Šefčovič, European Commissioner for Trade, said a deal between the EU and the US must be based on “mutual respect, and not threats.”

“The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” he wrote in a post on X Friday, adding that the European Commission “remains ready to work in good faith.”

“We stand ready to defend our interests,” he said.

Shortly after Trump’s Truth Social post on Friday morning, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox News interview that the “EU proposals have not been of the same quality that we’ve seen from our other important trading partners.”

“I’m not going to negotiate on TV, but I would hope that this would light a fire under the EU,” Bessent said, adding that the “EU has a collective action problem.”

The three major European stock market indexes fell sharply after Trump’s post: The benchmark STOXX 600 index was down 1.7%. Germany’s DAX fell 2.4% and France’s CAC index slid 2.2%. London’s FTSE index was 1% down. US stocks also slid, with the Dow opening lower by 480 points, or 1.15%. Stocks came off their lows after Bessent said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Friday that he expects US trade representatives to meet in person with Chinese officials again to continue trade negotiations following a temporary pause in higher tariff rates.

The tariff Trump is considering slapping on the EU is more than double the size of the 20% initial “reciprocal” tariff that was briefly in place in April before he swiftly paused those tariffs to allow for further negotiations.

The pause is set to expire on July 9. Since the pause, the only trade deal that’s been announced is with the United Kingdom. Bessent declined to share in the earlier Fox interview which country could be next to ink a deal with the US. However, he said talks are “far along with India,” and many Asian countries have presented “very good deals.”

“There are 18 important trading partners and, I would say, with the exception of the EU, most are negotiating in very good faith,” he said. Later in the Bloomberg interview he said he believes “over the next couple of weeks we’re going to have several large deals announced.”

Trump’s qualms with the EU

As he highlighted in his Truth Social post, the president takes particular issue with “non-monetary trade barriers,” as he has repeatedly called them; as well as countries or trading blocs that run trade deficits with the US. Those occur when the US purchases more from another trading partner than that country purchases from the US.

Last year, the US ran a $236 billion trade deficit with the EU, according to US Commerce Department data. That’s higher than the figures Trump cited.

Regarding non-monetary trade barriers, Trump has called out the EU for having value-added taxes (VATs) as well as digital service taxes (DSTs).

VATs are consumption taxes that are calculated such that consumers pay for all taxes that went into building the end product they purchase. However, when the EU exports goods to the US, for instance, a VAT is remitted. Meanwhile, when the US exports goods to the EU, those goods will be charged a VAT.

DSTs tax the gross revenue that online firms collect from offering services to users. A country with a DST would be able to tax all revenue collected by large companies that operate online — even if the business is unprofitable. That can include what they collect from selling data, advertising, as well as payments they receive for subscriptions, software and other kinds of online services users pay for.

American firms, namely Big Tech companies such as Meta, Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are disproportionately affected by DSTs, according to a report published last year by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.

EU countries respond

Earlier this month, the EU previewed a nearly $108 billion retaliatory tariff plan “covering a broad range of industrial and agricultural products” should talks with the US go south, a statement the European Commission published on May 8 said.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a separate statement that day that the EU made a “zero-for-zero” tariff offer and is working on a mutually beneficial solution. “But if and where negotiations fail, we also will act.”

“In other words, all instruments, all options stay on the table,” she said.

Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin called Trump’s threat “enormously disappointing,” he said in a statement posted on X on Friday. “I welcomed the pause in tariffs until early July to allow for continued negotiations between the EU and the US, and ideally an agreed outcome.”

He disputed Bessent’s claim that the EU isn’t negotiating in good faith, adding that “tariffs at the level suggested would not only push prices up, they would grievously damage one of the world’s most dynamic and significant trading relationships, as well as disrupting wider global trade.”

French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said in a Friday post on X that Trump’s threats “do not help at all during the negotiation period between the European Union and the United States.”

“We maintain the same stance: de-escalation but are ready to respond,” he said in a post translated by CNN.

Reigniting the trade war

Trump’s comments came after another trade-related post on Truth Social that threatened a 25% tariff on Apple if it continues to make the iPhone overseas.

The president met with Apple CEO Tim Cook earlier in the week — and also during his trip to the Middle East the week before. Bessent told Fox News on Friday that he also spoke to Cook, and the discussions went well. So it’s unclear what prompted Trump’s morning trade war ramp-up.

Cook had previously said that Apple would relocate iPhone production for the United States to India from China to pay a lower tariff cost. Yet Trump last week and on Friday said he was upset that Apple wasn’t making iPhones in the United States.

It took intense lobbying from President Donald Trump, an all-nighter, and a vote on a bill for which many people did not yet have a clear grasp of the final changes, but House Republicans got it done this week. They passed their version of the “one big, beautiful bill,” a behemoth that pairs tax cuts with new provisions that will push people off Medicaid and food assistance.

Low-income Americans will feel the effect of changes to aid programs, while the wealthy will see most of the windfall from tax cuts, according to multiple assessments.

Democrats argue the trade-off is cruel, but Republicans say it’s necessary to deliver on Trump’s economic agenda and to root out waste and fraud, protecting the programs for those who need them.

What the House passed is an opening bid as the process now shifts to the US Senate, which must pass its own version of a tax and spending bill.

Senators will be gauging the public reaction to the House bill and what critics have said is a reverse transfer of wealth, much of which will be put on the nation’s credit card in the form of deficit spending.

Here’s a look at how the “one big, beautiful bill” takes benefits from lower-income Americans in order to cut taxes, primarily for the wealthy.

What is the basic math of the bill?

How much does the bill cut in taxes? How much does it cut in spending?

The House’s tax and spending cuts package is certainly a “big” bill in terms of its impact. We don’t have all the final figures yet because the Congressional Budget Office is still working on the analysis of the final version of the bill, which contained some significant last-minute changes.

But CBO’s initial estimates found that the package’s tax measures would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over a decade, while other provisions would cut nearly $1 trillion in federal support for Medicaid and food stamps over that period.

Medicaid, which provides health insurance to low-income Americans, would face the largest cuts in the package, with CBO projecting a nearly $700 billion reduction in federal spending. Meanwhile, food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would face a $267 billion cut in federal support.

The bill would also increase spending for defense, immigration enforcement and homeland security, while pulling back on federal spending in some other areas.

How much does it add to the national debt?

The national debt is more than $37 trillion. How much would this bill add to that incredible figure?

Overall, the bill would add $3.1 trillion to the nation’s debt, including interest, over the next decade, according to an early independent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

We are still waiting for the final word from CBO.

Long-term budget projections are notoriously difficult, and House Republicans were altering the provisions up until just before they passed the bill. Plus, things could change when senators start working on their version.

Would people notice these tax cuts?

Most of the tax cuts in the bill aren’t exactly cuts, but rather extensions of tax cuts from Trump’s first term. Will most Americans see their tax bill go down if something like this bill becomes law?

Currently, if Congress doesn’t act, most Americans would see their taxes increase because the individual income tax cuts from the 2017 bill are set to expire at the end of this year. The House package would make permanent essentially all of those provisions.

However, many people may not notice that aspect of the legislation since “all it’s going to do is extend the tax system that they’ve come to know and hate,” said Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

But here’s the impact the bill would have compared with Congress doing nothing: On average, the majority of Americans would see a tax cut next year — more than 80%, in fact, according to the center’s analysis of the tax provisions. The average household would see their federal taxes drop by about $2,900.

However, that doesn’t include the impact of the spending cuts, which we’ll get to in a minute.

Where does the money from the tax cuts go?

What do we know about how much goes to wealthier taxpayers and how much goes to middle-class and lower-wage taxpayers?

Higher-income taxpayers would come out ahead, with 60% of the tax cuts going to the top 20%, who have incomes of at least $217,000, next year and more than a third going to the top 5%, or those who earn $460,000 or more, according to the center.

The following numbers show how the rich would get the biggest boost in their after-tax income compared to others.

Those in the top 20% would see an average tax cut of $12,660 next year, increasing their after-tax income by 3.4%. But again, that’s compared with current law, in which Trump’s first-term tax cuts are expiring.

Middle-income earners, those making between about $67,000 and $119,000, would get a tax break of $1,840, bumping up their after-tax income by 2.4%, while those in the lowest bracket, who earn less than about $35,000, would get a tax cut of $160, nudging up their after-tax income by 0.8%.

Individual circumstances will also play a major role, since the tax package provides targeted breaks for certain groups. For instance, because of the temporary elimination of taxes on tips and overtime, those who receive those types of compensation could see more tax relief than other workers making the same income.

Are there any accounting tricks in here?

There’s an important reason Trump’s 2017 tax cuts now need to be extended. In 2017, lawmakers were able to make it appear like the tax cuts would have less of a long-term effect on the deficit and national debt by making them temporary. They bet, correctly, that this year’s Congress would prioritize either extending the tax cuts or making them permanent. Are there any similar accounting tricks in this bill?

There certainly are! House Republicans included many of Trump’s campaign promises in the bill but made them temporary to reduce their cost.

The elimination of taxes on tips and overtime would be in effect from 2025 through 2028, as would be the $4,000 boost in the standard deduction for senior citizens, which aims to fulfill Trump’s promise to end taxes on Social Security benefits. Plus, the deduction of up to $10,000 in interest on certain car loans also expires after 2028.

Several of the package’s business tax measures — which are factored into the tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans — are also temporary. That’s one reason why the bill is not as advantageous to the super-rich in later years.

Separately — and this is not a matter of accounting, but rather of politics — new work requirements for Medicaid, which are expected to push millions of people out of the program and likely leave them uninsured, wouldn’t kick in until the end of 2026, which is notably after the midterm election. However, states would have the option of implementing the mandate earlier in the year.

Making all the temporary individual and business tax provisions permanent would add $5.1 trillion to the nation’s debt, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s early analysis.

What about the spending cuts?

The bill partially offsets tax cuts by slashing Medicaid coverage and food stamps. How does that factor into the impact the bill will have on the country?

This is key to understanding the bill’s overall effect on Americans’ wallets, particularly on those who are lower on the income ladder.

The deep spending cuts to Medicaid and food stamps will result in millions of people losing access to their health insurance and food assistance, leaving them far worse off financially. The measures, particularly introducing work requirements to Medicaid and expanding them in the food stamps program, will not only be felt by the low-income adults that the Republicans are targeting, but also children, senior citizens, people with disabilities and others, experts say.

The Penn Wharton Budget Model crunched the numbers, taking into consideration both the tax cuts and spending reductions on Medicaid and food stamps, as well as the changes to the federal student loan program, which aim to limit the federal role in student borrowing.

It found that the lowest-income Americans, making up to about $17,000, would see their incomes fall by $820, on average, next year – after taking into account taxes and certain government benefits. That’s a drop of 14.6%, on average.

The next group, with incomes between $17,000 and $51,000, would lose $430 in income, or 1.1%, on average.

Middle-income households would fare better, receiving a tax break of $840, or a 1.1% gain in income, on average. These taxpayers have incomes between $51,000 and $93,000.

But the highest earners, those making more than $174,000, would enjoy bigger income boosts, of just over $12,000, or 2.6%, on average.

“For lower income people, what they are losing in Medicaid, Affordable Care Act premium support and food stamps more than dominates any type of benefits from taxes on tips and other tax cuts,” said Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model. “And they’re not going to make it back through economic growth.”

What happens next?

This bill is probably unlikely to pass the Senate in its current form. What do we know, if anything, about how Senate Republicans might change it?

Changes seem like a certainty. This bill is being passed under a budget reconciliation process that allows Republicans a way around filibuster rules. That means they can make their megabill law with only Republican votes in the Senate, although they only have three votes to spare with Vice President JD Vance’s tie-breaking vote. Some GOP senators want more spending cuts. Others are worried about the Medicaid changes. One wants a more generous tax credit for children. Plus, non-budget-related items could be stripped by the Senate parliamentarian. Assuming something ultimately passes the Senate, it would then have to go back to the House. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson have shown an ability to get things over the finish line. But this will be a major legislative test for new Senate Majority Leader John Thune.

Is anybody seriously talking about solving the debt problem?

Despite the cuts, the bill still adds to the national debt. Is there any active talk across party lines about how to deal with Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security spending, which the government says are unsustainable?

The short answer is no. The bill we’re talking about right now has more tax cuts than spending cuts, which is why it adds to the deficit. The things driving deficit spending are the growth in Medicare and Social Security as baby boomers age. Both programs’ trust funds could run out of the money they need to pay full benefits in a decade or so. Yet neither party is making reform of those programs a top priority, in large part because touching them is politically toxic. Solutions would probably have to be bipartisan. There are plenty of known solutions — things like incremental changes to the retirement age or payroll tax hikes on higher wage earners — but those are not currently being seriously debated. On Medicaid, the GOP answer is the cuts in the bill, but it’s paired with much larger tax cuts.

Infection-causing fungi responsible for millions of deaths a year will spread significantly to new regions as the planet heats up, new research predicts — and the world is not prepared.

Fungi are absolutely everywhere. A vast kingdom of organisms, from mold to mushrooms, they grow in environments such as soil, compost and water. They play an important role in ecosystems but can have a devastating impact on human health: Fungal infections kill an estimated 2.5 million people a year, and a lack of data means that number could be far higher.

Yet we are still very far from understanding them, especially how these incredibly adaptable organisms will respond to a warming climate.

A team of scientists from Manchester University used computer simulations and forecasts to map the potential future spread of Aspergillus, a common group of fungi found all over the world that can cause aspergillosis, a life-threatening disease primarily affecting the lungs.

They found certain Aspergillus species will expand their range as the climate crisis intensifies, pushing into new parts of North America, Europe, China and Russia. The study, published this month, is currently being peer reviewed.

“Fungi are relatively under-researched compared to viruses and parasites, but these maps show that fungal pathogens will likely impact most areas of the world in the future,” said Norman van Rijn, one of the study’s authors and a climate change and infectious diseases researcher at the University of Manchester.

The field has seen new attention thanks to the popular HBO television drama “The Last of Us,” which follows people trying to survive in a world where an infectious mutant fungus has turned most of the population into violent monsters. (HBO and CNN share the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)

It’s fiction, van Rijn said, but he hopes it will raise the profile of fungal infections that are killing millions in reality.

Aspergillus fungi grow like small filaments in soils all over the world. Like almost all fungi, they release huge numbers of tiny spores that spread through the air.

Humans inhale spores every day but most people won’t experience any health issues; their immune system clears them.

It’s a different story for those with lung conditions including asthma, cystic fibrosis and COPD, as well as people with compromised immune systems, such as cancer and organ transplant patients, and those who have had severe flu or Covid-19.

If the body’s immune system fails to clear the spores, the fungus “starts to grow and basically kind of eat you from the inside out, saying it really bluntly,” van Rijn said.

Aspergillosis has very high mortality rates at around 20% to 40%, he said. It’s also very difficult to diagnose, as doctors don’t always have it on their radar and patients often present with fevers and coughs, symptoms common to many illnesses.

Fungal pathogens are also becoming increasingly resistant to treatment, van Rijn added. There are only four classes of antifungal medicines available.

This all spells bad news as the climate shifts open up new areas for Aspergillus to colonize.

Aspergillus flavus, a species that tends to prefer hotter, tropical climates, could increase its spread by 16% if humans continue burning large amounts of fossil fuels, the study found. It’s predicted to push into parts of northern America, northern China and Russia.

This species can cause severe infections in humans and is resistant to many antifungal medications. It also infects a range of food crops, posing a potential threat to food security. The World Health Organization added Aspergillus flavus to its critical group of fungal pathogens in 2022 because of its public health impact and antifungal resistance risk.

Aspergillus fumigatus, which prefers more temperate climates, is predicted to spread northwards toward the North Pole as global temperatures rise. Its spread could increase by 77.5% by 2100, the study found, potentially exposing 9 million people in Europe.

Conversely, temperatures in some regions, including sub-Saharan Africa, could become so hot they are no longer hospitable to Aspergillus fungi. This could bring its own problems, as fungi play an important role in ecosystems, including healthy soils.

As well as expanding their growing range, a warming world could also be increasing fungi’s temperature tolerance, allowing them to better survive inside human bodies.

Extreme weather events such as drought, floods and heatwaves can affect fungi, too, helping to spread spores over long distances. There have been spikes in fungal disease following natural disasters, such as the outbreak after the 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri.

The new Aspergillus study “rightfully shines a light on the threat of fungi that dwell in our natural environment and how under-prepared we are to cope with shifts in their prevalence,” said Elaine Bignell, co-director of the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the research.

Many uncertainties remain, however, and there is still a huge amount of research to be done, she told CNN.

Despite the deadly nature of aspergillosis, there is a real lack of data on where the pathogen is in the environment and who gets infected, said Justin Remais, a professor of environmental health sciences at UC Berkeley, who was not involved in the research.

He is leading a study of more than 100 million patients across the United States, which identified more than 20,000 aspergillosis cases between 2013 and 2023. The number of cases is increasing about 5% each year, he said.

“Fungal pathogens are becoming increasingly common and resistant to treatment, and we are only beginning to understand how climate change is contributing,” he told CNN.

People are used to hearing about diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites, but much less so fungal diseases, said Bignell. “There is a desperate need to reverse this trend given the lethality,” she said.

“Any of us in the future might be affected.”

Elyse Martin-Smith began meeting with her classmates at Harvard University last summer to plan the annual Black student graduation hosted by a campus group she leads.

The ceremony was set to be a celebration of Black culture, featuring musicians, poetry readings, messages about the historic struggle for racial equality, and a speech by Nikole Hannah-Jones, the creator of the “1619 Project,” Martin-Smith said.

Students had reserved Harvard Memorial Church on campus for the event, she said.

But in early May, Martin-Smith said she received an email from university officials saying she would not be allowed to host the Black graduation on campus.

Harvard is among several universities across the country that have canceled affinity graduations amid threats from President Donald Trump to block medical research funding and revoke accreditation from schools that don’t end diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Trump decries these programs as “illegal and immoral discrimination.”

Affinity graduations are optional events typically led by students to celebrate different student identities and ethnicities. Commonly held ceremonies often honor Black, Hispanic, Asian, first-generation and LGBTQ+ students. Students say the events are significant because they honor the music, apparel, food, history, language and traditions unique to their identity.

Harvard and other elite universities have also clashed with Trump over his demands for crackdowns on student protests, including pro-Palestinian demonstrations and purported antisemitism.

The lost support for affinity graduations — coming just weeks before most universities were set to hold their commencement events — left some students scrambling to find ways to still host the events.

Martin-Smith said she was “disappointed but not surprised” when the school canceled the Black student graduation hosted by her group, Harvard Undergraduate Black Community Leaders.

In late April, Harvard announced it was renaming its diversity, equity, and inclusion office and rescinding all funding from affinity group commencement celebrations. The move came after the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in federal funding for Harvard when the Ivy League school initially said it would not follow policy demands from the administration.

“This isn’t the first time the university has catered to PR (public relations) concerns rather than student concerns,” Martin-Smith said.

Martin-Smith was determined to hold the Black graduation and spent time between finals study sessions calling venues to secure a space off campus, she said.

She ultimately found a venue and obtained support from the Black Graduate Student Alliance and the Harvard Black Alumni Society. The event will be held on May 27 and will still feature a similar program to the initial event, Martin-Smith said.

“It’s an undue burden that continues to be placed upon Black students to create the change that we want to see,” Martin-Smith said.

Students at the University of Kentucky faced a similar dilemma when the school announced earlier this year it was canceling all affinity graduations.

“Following a number of federal and state policy changes and directives, the university will no longer host identity-based or special-interest graduation celebrations,” university spokesperson Jay Blanton said in a statement. “In the past, these were held outside of our official commencement ceremonies as optional celebrations and social events. We will continue to comply with the law, while celebrating all students and their distinctive achievements at our official commencement ceremonies.”

Kristopher Washington, a University of Kentucky graduate, said he was disappointed to learn that there would no longer be a Black student graduation on campus — an event he had looked forward to throughout his college career.

Washington collaborated with his fraternity brothers from Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. to find an off-campus venue where they could still host a cultural graduation for their peers.

He secured support from the Lyric Theatre & Cultural Arts Center in Lexington, where they held the event dubbed “Senior Salute,” Washington said.

The ceremony was open to all graduates and Washington’s fraternity encouraged students to wear items signifying their identity or culture.

“I feel it’s important to show that there are people coming from other places, underprivileged areas and many different backgrounds and struggles and still making it over to UK (University of Kentucky) and still getting their degree,” Washington said. “It’s a tremendous achievement.”

‘Giving us a space to celebrate’

One expert said graduations celebrating students’ ethnic identities are important because most main commencement celebrations have European roots.

Antar Tichavakunda, an assistant professor of race and higher education at the University of California, Santa Barbara, pointed out that “Pomp and Circumstance” — a song commonly played at graduations — is by English composer Edward Elgar. He also noted that the tradition of wearing graduation gowns originated in Europe during medieval times.

Many Black graduations have embraced Black culture by incorporating West African drums, strolling by Black Greek letter organizations, and featuring guest speakers who understand the Black experience, Tichavakunda said.

“Giving us a space to celebrate like we’d like to and not be policed, play music that feels more affirming and culturally responsive in a smaller setting really just makes that moment of completing a degree that much sweeter,” said Tichavakunda, who is also author of “Black Campus Life: The Worlds Black Students Make at a Historically White Institution.”

“It definitely speaks to pride and not having to dim part of your identity to be palatable to others.”

‘We stand up and stand strong’

Members of the LGBTQ+ community have also seen their traditional Lavender Graduations canceled at schools across the country due to anti-DEI policies at both the state and federal levels.

Last year, Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs from higher education, the public education system and government employers.

Jacey Thornton, executive director of Project Rainbow Utah, said that the law led to the closure of resource centers focused on gender, race and identity at colleges and universities. It also meant that universities would no longer support the Lavender Graduations that celebrate the achievements of LGBTQ+ graduates.

Thornton said Project Rainbow helped LGBTQ+ students at Weber State University and the University of Utah find ways to gather with their community.

For example, Thornton said Project Rainbow sponsored an event at a church for the University of Utah’s LGBTQ+ community where they hung pride flags and graduates wore the lavender stoles and rainbow tassels that are traditionally worn at Lavender Graduations on college campuses. Students from Westminster University and Salt Lake Community College were also invited, she said.

It’s important for LGBTQ+ students to be able to celebrate their graduation in a space where they feel welcome and embraced, Thornton said, who graduated with a master of social work from Weber State this spring.

“We are holding space to celebrate the obstacles we have overcome as queer people,” Thornton said. “It’s important that we stand up and stand strong. A lot of us lose biological family in the process of transitioning or coming out as queer. This supports that space for us to come together and find a new chosen family.”

Tichavakunda said universities’ withdrawal of support from affinity groups signals to students that they should consider schools that fully embrace their identity and offer programs to help them navigate college. For Black students, he recommended considering HBCUs.

Students who choose to attend universities despite the loss of DEI practices will need to work harder to preserve cultural traditions, Tichavakunda said.

“For future classes, I think this administration is forcing students and faculty to think creatively beyond the university and work around it,” he said. “But I don’t think this will be the end of culturally specific graduations. I just think it might be the end of universities supporting them.”

International Harvard students say they are experiencing “pure panic” amid the Trump administration’s move to bar foreign enrollment, as students from around the world told CNN they are coming to grips with the possibility of revoked visas, suspended research and being blocked from reentry to the United States if they leave this summer.

A federal judge temporarily halted the Trump administration’s ban on Friday, after the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college filed a suit in federal court. Harvard argued revocation of its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program was “clear retaliation” for its refusal of the government’s ideologically rooted policy demands.

But thousands of international students remain in limbo, and are “very clearly, extremely afraid” because they don’t know their current legal status, Harvard student body co-president Abdullah Shahid Sial, who is from Lahore, Pakistan, told CNN on Friday.

“They’re literally like, teenagers, thousands of miles away from their hometowns having to deal with this situation, which lawyers often fear to engage in,” said Sial, who is currently traveling overseas after exams.

Sial, speaking Saturday from Japan, told CNN he is unsure whether he will be allowed back into the US, or if he will be able to stay.

“As of right now, I’m not sure if I can attend the next semester or not,” he said.

About 27% of Harvard’s student body is international, with 6,793 international undergraduates and grad students hailing from nearly every country in the world.

“Harvard is Harvard because it has the ability to attract people – the best people – from all over the world, not just the United States,” Sial told CNN on Friday. “The US also benefits heavily from having the best in the world come to the university and study. And then they’ve been dehumanized and disrespected.”

Sial said the university and deans have been helpful in supporting international students at a time of uncertainty and “pure panic,” which is happening days after final exams ended and just one week before graduation.

As student body president, he says he is working to encourage the university to assist international students who want to transfer to other colleges and pushing for students’ financial aid packages to transfer, as well. But the window to transfer to other universities for the fall semester is already closed at most colleges, Sial said.

“Many of us have worked our entire lives to get to a university like Harvard, and now we need to wait around and see if we might have to transfer out and face difficulties with visas,” says rising junior Karl Molden, from Austria.

Molden, who is also traveling abroad and concerned he won’t be allowed to return to campus, said he feels international students are being used as a “ball in this larger fight between democracy and authoritarianism.”

Jared, an 18-year-old in New Zealand, was just accepted to Harvard and had been planning to start undergraduate studies at the Ivy League school this fall. He told CNN it was a “heart drop” moment when he learned of the Trump administration’s announcement – which came in the midst of applying for his student visa and preparing to move the 9,000 miles to Boston.

Jewish students ‘being used as pawns,’ says one Israeli student

Harvard and Trump officials have been locked in conflict for months as the administration demands the university make changes to campus programming, policies, hiring and admissions to root out what the White House has called antisemitism and “racist” practices.

Like many other colleges and universities, Harvard drew intense criticism last year for its handling of pro-Palestinian protests and encampments following the start of the Israel-Hamas war, as well as complaints from Jewish alumni and students about antisemitism on campus.

Harvard has acknowledged antisemitism on its campus, particularly during the previous academic year, and said it has begun taking concrete action to address it.

An Israeli postdoctoral student studying at Harvard said she feels like Jewish students are “being used as pawns” by the Trump administration, which has accused the university of perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is “hostile to Jewish students” and “employs racist diversity, equity and inclusion practices.”

The Israeli student, who did not want to be named in fear of being denied reentry to the United States, said she believed the Trump administration was “using” the university to “have this battle with academia that is much bigger than Harvard.”

She said the government was clamping down on ideas that “don’t always align with the administration, rather than (having) an actual concern for the safety of Jewish students, Israeli students.”

“So, I do feel like we’re being used,” she said, adding that she thinks university leadership is taking the issue of antisemitism on campus seriously. “I don’t want to diminish anyone’s experience at the university. I know people have had tough experiences, but I do feel like I have, personally, 100% trust and faith in our leadership.”

Another Israeli master’s student studying at Harvard, who wished to remain anonymous due to concerns about how speaking publicly might impact their studies, told CNN it is “very important for Israelis and Jewish people to come here and still be very strong in what they believe in … And not only in Harvard, I would say in American academia and on American campuses right now, more than ever.”

Young researchers say they will leave US

One graduate student from Australia, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being denied future US visas, told CNN it “feels extraordinary that we are all being punished” for campus activism, given that researchers and PhD students often don’t have the time or interest to engage.

“As a graduate student, we are just fully occupied with our research work, which I would say I spend 80 to 100 hours on each week,” said the Australian student, adding that the showdown between the Trump administration and Harvard will likely lead to researchers leaving the country. “If things really hit the fan, (I) would probably be trying to transfer to a school in the UK.”

Other graduate students said they are also feeling fear and uncertainty, with concerns for their research work, their future careers and their loved ones.

“There’s the ramifications for their family, you know, spouses, their children, their enrollment, their work status, their rent, housing, everything,” said Fangzhou Jiang, 30, from China. He is a Harvard Kennedy School student going into his second year of a master’s program. “You just don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Facing deportation from the US, and retribution at home

For some international students, like those from countries at war or experiencing political turmoil, the stakes are even higher.

Maria Kuznetsova, a former spokesperson for OVD-Info, a Russian independent human rights monitoring group, is currently a graduate student at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. She’s graduating in a week and had planned to work on a Harvard-sponsored visa that had already been granted, but she fears it may be canceled now.

“I used to work in Russian human rights and in the opposition, which means I can’t return to Russia,” Kuznetsova told CNN. “And since I’ve been living in the US for two years now, I don’t even have a European visa. So, I don’t really know where I could even go geographically if things go wrong.”

“From what I see, people are still in a state of panic – everyone’s waiting for the court’s decision,” Kuznetsova said.

“It’s not just me from Russia here – there are also many Ukrainians, a lot of political students from Venezuela, and people from Afghanistan and Palestine. I even have a classmate from North Korea. These are people who, quite literally, cannot return to their home countries,” she added.

Ivan Bogantsev, also from Russia, was planning to stay in the US after completing his program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. His wife, currently in Russia and also on a Harvard-sponsored visa, is due to arrive for his graduation, but he’s unsure whether she’ll be allowed entry.

“No one seems able to explain whether we’re at risk of deportation or not,” Bogantsev told CNN. “I believe a brain drain from this country is absolutely guaranteed. I can’t say to what extent, but the environment here is extremely unfriendly.”

But he said going back to Russia is not an option he is considering.

“I was detained at rallies (in Russia), and let’s just say the atmosphere was growing increasingly tense. And secondly, most of my friends are essentially labeled (in Russia) as criminals, traitors or foreign agents.”

‘Harvard campus will not be the same’

Leo Gerdén, from Sweden, who is supposed to graduate next week, told CNN that some of his friends still at Harvard “are making new plans of transferring, especially to other institutions abroad.”

“I was looking forward to celebrating commencement next week, but now, you know, I might leave this place and it will not look the same next semester, because without these international students and its international researchers, the Harvard campus will not be the same,” Gerdén said.

“We are being used essentially as poker chips in a battle between the White House and Harvard, and it feels honestly very dehumanizing.”

A federal judge has temporarily halted the Trump administration’s ban on Harvard University’s ability to enroll international students.

US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs ruled hours after the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college filed suit Friday. Harvard argued revocation of its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program was “clear retaliation” for its refusal of the government’s ideologically rooted policy demands.

Burroughs is the same judge considering a separate lawsuit from Harvard challenging the administration’s freeze of $2.65 billion in federal funding.

Harvard’s latest complaint argues the decision Thursday to drop the school from the Department of Homeland Security’s SEVP system violates the law.

“It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government’s demands to control Harvard’s governance, curriculum, and the ‘ideology’ of its faculty and students,” the complaint states.

Burroughs, an Obama appointee, said in her order Harvard had shown “it will sustain immediate and irreparable injury” if government were allowed to revoke the school’s certification before the court could consider the matter.

A remote conference in the case is set for Tuesday. Two days later, the judge is due to hear arguments at the federal courthouse in Boston over whether to issue a preliminary injunction – an order that would block the administration’s action until a final decision is made in the lawsuit.

The Thursday hearing is scheduled to begin while Harvard’s commencement program is underway, with many international students celebrating their degrees as the fate of foreign scholars at the school is decided at a courthouse across the Charles River, only 6 miles away.

The Trump administration’s revocation of Harvard’s ability to enroll international students came as sharp punishment to the elite institution for refusing to bow to White House policy demands. Rooted in political ideology, the requirements – such as handing over student disciplinary records and killing equity initiatives – also have been placed on other US colleges.

“Harvard can no longer enroll foreign students and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status,” the US Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.

“With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body,” Harvard’s lawsuit says.

The university will fight for its international students, its president, Alan Garber, promised the Harvard community.

“You are our classmates and friends, our colleagues and mentors, our partners in the work of this great institution,” he said Friday in a statement. “Thanks to you, we know more and understand more, and our country and our world are more enlightened and more resilient. We will support you as we do our utmost to ensure that Harvard remains open to the world.”

Harvard’s new lawsuit was filed against the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and State, as well as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

“This lawsuit seeks to kneecap the President’s constitutionally vested powers under Article II. It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments,” said Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.

“The Trump administration is committed to restoring common sense to our student visa system; no lawsuit, this or any other, is going to change that. We have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.”

At the White House on Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump was asked whether he’s considering stopping other universities from accepting foreign students. “We’re taking a look at a lot of things,” he said.

“Harvard is going to have to change its ways. So are some others,” the president continued.

Government attacks threaten Harvard finances

Harvard already is fighting the White House in court over its freeze in recent weeks of $2.65 billion in federal grants and contracts. In that lawsuit, which coincidentally is also being heard by Burroughs, the university chose not to request an immediate court order blocking the decision, meaning the freeze is likely to stay in place at least until late July, when both sides will present their arguments.

Although the two lawsuits are separate legal matters, Harvard cites freezing funding and blocking international students as part of a pattern – what it calls a government “campaign to coerce Harvard into surrendering its First Amendment rights.”

On yet another front challenging the institution’s finances, the Internal Revenue Service is making plans to rescind Harvard’s tax-exempt status.

The bombshell over foreign scholars’ enrollment comes as students from around the world were preparing to attend one of the nation’s most prestigious universities. One would-be incoming freshman from New Zealand described hearing the news as a “heart drop” moment.

“There is simply no replacing the presence and contributions of these individuals and future generations of international students who will feel that entrusting their education and their future to Harvard is too risky, unless the court immediately steps in to reverse the government’s decision and confirm that this highly disruptive action is unlawful,” Harvard international affairs vice provost Mark Elliott said in an affidavit.

Noem said she ordered her department to terminate Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, citing the university’s refusal to turn over the conduct records of foreign students requested by the DHS last month.

Harvard’s suit says it did provide requested information to the department, but “DHS deemed Harvard’s responses ‘insufficient’ – without explaining why or citing any regulation with which Harvard failed to comply.”

The university accuses the government of failing to follow its own requirements for removing a university from the Student and Exchange Visitor program.

“The Revocation Notice offered Harvard no opportunity to defend itself against the withdrawal of its certification, including to present evidence or be heard on its argument that it has complied with the law.”

Harvard can regain its ability to enroll international students if it submits five years’ worth of records related international students’ conduct “within 72 hours,” according to Noem’s letter to Harvard.

In its Friday lawsuit, Harvard says the new statement from the government adds to its original requirements, noting the government “cited no statutory or regulatory authority for these additional demands.”

The termination could impact nearly 7,000 Harvard students who are now flung into anxiety and confusion. Professors warn a mass exodus of foreign students threatens to stifle Harvard’s academic prowess, even as it battles against the government for its ideological autonomy.

The White House on Thursday accused Harvard leadership of turning “their once-great institution into a hot-bed of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators” and said, “enrolling foreign students is a privilege, not a right.”

“They have repeatedly failed to take action to address the widespread problems negatively impacting American students and now they must face the consequences of their actions,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CNN.

Harvard and Trump officials have been locked in conflict for months as the administration demands the university make changes to campus programming, policies, hiring and admissions to root out on-campus antisemitism and eliminate what it calls “racist ‘diversity, equity and inclusion’ practices.” The White House has homed in on foreign students and staff it believes participated in contentious campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war.

Harvard, meanwhile, has acknowledged antisemitism on its campus, particularly last academic year, and said it has begun taking concrete steps to address it.

The government’s decision will effectively kick a lot of Jewish students out of the university, said Harvard’s former president, Lawrence Summers.

“The president and his administration have made a big deal – and they’ve been right – about Israel and antisemitism,” Summers told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Friday. “Sending every Israeli student out of Harvard is much more discriminatory against Israelis and is much more discriminatory against Jews than anything they have complained about.”

The university’s leadership argues many of the government’s requests, including an “audit” of the “viewpoint” of its students and staff, go far beyond the role of the federal government and may violate Harvard’s constitutional rights.

Harvard is among dozens of US universities facing harsh demands from the Trump administration, but it has emerged as the fiercest defender of its academic independence.

The university swiftly condemned the SEVP revocation as “unlawful,” saying in a statement it is “fully committed to maintaining Harvard’s ability to host international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University – and this nation – immeasurably.”

“We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community. This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard’s academic and research mission,” university spokesperson Jason Newton said.

The university has an enormous foreign student population that could be impacted. It says it has 9,970 people in its international academic population, and data shows 6,793 international students comprise 27.2% of its enrollment in the 2024-25 academic year.

Like many other colleges and universities, Harvard drew intense criticism last year for its handling of pro-Palestinian protests and encampments following the start of the Israel-Hamas war, as well as complaints from Jewish alumni and students about antisemitism on campus.

Reports released by two Harvard task forces last month concluded that both Jewish and Muslim students feared for their safety during the 2023-24 academic year and had deep feelings of alienation and academic censorship on campus. They included broad recommendations and policy changes as remedies, some of which Harvard has already made.

Rabbi Jason Rubenstein, executive director of Harvard Hillel, said in a statement the university is “in the midst of a long and long-overdue reckoning with anti-Semitism,” adding President Garber “has taken important steps to address both the manifestations and deeper causes of anti-Jewish discrimination at Harvard.”

The federal government’s “current, fast-paced assault” against Harvard, Rubenstein says, “is neither deliberate nor methodical, and its disregard for the necessities of negotiation and due process threatens the bulwarks of institutional independence and the rule of law that undergird our shared freedoms.”

Harvard has also implemented some changes to comply with the Trump administration’s requests, including changing the name of its Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging to Community and Campus Life.

But Noem, in a letter to Harvard on Thursday, accused the university of “perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes-pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist “diversity, equity and inclusion’ practices.” She did not mention Muslim or Arab students.

The Trump administration appears poised to make an example of Harvard as it threatens similar punishment to other institutions if they don’t cooperate.

“This should be a warning to every other university to get your act together,” Noem said on Fox News.

Students and staff are horrified

Some of Harvard’s students and staff were stunned by the announcement, which has left thousands of international students in limbo as they mourn their connection to a university that many of them fought tooth and nail to attend.

“This is extortion,” said Summers, who also served as Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. “It’s a vendetta using all the powers of the government because of a political argument with Harvard.”

Jared, an 18-year-old in New Zealand, told CNN it was a “heart drop” moment when he learned he may not be able to start his undergraduate degree at the Ivy League school this fall.

“To me, it’s one of, if not the best school in the world,” Jared said, contrasting the news with the “really special moment” for him and his family when he learned in March he’d been accepted to Harvard to study Sociology.

Jared was in the process of applying for his student visa and preparing to move the 9,000 miles to Boston when he learned of the Trump administration’s announcement.

Now he’s in limbo and looking at other resources the university may offer, such as online learning.

“There’s really no use for me getting too worked up over something that I can’t control, you know. I’m just focused on doing what I can control,” he said.

Existing international students at Harvard are likewise faced with an uncertain future. Rising junior Karl Molden, from Austria, is traveling abroad and says he’s terrified he won’t be allowed to return to campus. International students have been nervously messaging each other, he said.

“Many of us have worked our entire lives to get to a university like Harvard, and now we need to wait around and see if we might have to transfer out and face difficulties with visas,” Molden said.

The Austrian junior said other international students he’s been in touch with are wondering if they will be able to complete summer internships – others worry they won’t get the same generous financial aid Harvard offers from another college.

Molden said international students are being used as a “play ball in this larger fight between democracy and authoritarianism.”

“Coming from Austria, I’m a little bit more familiar … with the authoritarian playbook and how authoritarians can kill democracies,” he said. “What I’ve been seeing in the US in the past few months is that.”

Some Harvard staff worry draining the university of its foreign students would debilitate the academic power of both the institution and, potentially, American academia as a whole.

Harvard economics professor and former Obama administration official Jason Furman called the measure “horrendous on every level.”

“It is impossible to imagine Harvard without our amazing international students. They are a huge benefit to everyone here, to innovation and the United States more broadly,” Furman said. “Higher education is one of America’s great exports and a key source of our soft power. I hope this is stopped quickly before the damage gets any worse.”

Another professor familiar with the situation told CNN that if the policy goes into effect, he fears “many labs will empty out.”

Australia’s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, said the move “will be distressing for Harvard’s many Australian students” and is offering them consular advice as they closely monitor the situation.

Harvard’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors said in a statement it “condemns in the strongest possible terms the Trump administration’s unconstitutional assault on our international students.”

The group of professors said the decision “expands the Trump administration’s terrorizing assault on international students and scholars in the United States.”

“International students are essential members of the Harvard community,” the statement continued.

It is a sentiment echoed Friday by the statement from Harvard’s president.

“For those international students and scholars affected by today’s action, know that you are vital members of our community,” Garber said. “You are our classmates and friends, our colleagues and mentors, our partners in the work of this great institution.”

Hong Kong CNN —

The Trump administration’s move to bar Harvard University from enrolling international students has ricocheted across China, with officials and commentators seeing it through one lens: the growing rivalry between Washington and Beijing.

“China has consistently opposed the politicization of educational collaboration,” a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said Friday, adding that the US move “will only tarnish its own image and reputation in the world.”

Some commentators across Chinese social media platforms took a similar tack: “It’s fun to watch them destroy their own strength,” read one comment on the X-like platform Weibo that garnered hundreds of likes.

“Trump comes to the rescue again,” wrote another, commenting on a hashtag about the news, which has tens of millions of views. “Recruiting international students is … the main way to attract top talent! After this road is cut off, will Harvard still be the same Harvard?”

The announcement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a clear escalation of a dispute between the oldest and the richest Ivy League institution and the White House and part of a broader drive to tighten control over international students in the US amid an immigration crackdown. The administration of US President Donald Trump has revoked hundreds of student visas in nearly every corner of the country as part of a vast immigration crackdown.

Harvard and Trump’s administration have been locked in conflict for months as the administration demanded the university make changes to campus operations. The government has homed in on foreign students and staff it believes participated in contentious campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war.

But the revocation isn’t just about a feud between a university and the US president. It’s also the latest in a widening rupture between two superpowers.

For years, China sent more international students to America than any other country. Those deep educational ties are being reshaped by a growing geopolitical rivalry that has fueled an ongoing trade and tech war.

“This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Thursday.

The DHS statement included claims of ties between Harvard and Chinese institutions or individuals linked to military-related research, as well as with an entity blacklisted by the Trump administration for alleged human rights violations. It links to information about a letter that bipartisan US lawmakers sent earlier this week to Harvard requesting information about the university’s alleged “partnerships with foreign adversaries.”

Harvard has not replied to a CNN request for comment on the alleged partnerships. In a statement on its website, the university said it was “committed to maintaining our ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University and this nation.”

‘Absolute shock’

The ability of elite American universities to recruit top students from around the world, many of whom often go on to stay in the United States, has long been seen as a critical factor in America’s science and tech prowess, as well as a key source of income for its universities.

The decision by the DHS both bars Harvard from enrolling international students for the coming academic year and requires current foreign students to transfer to another university to maintain their status.

International students make up more than a quarter of Harvard’s student body, with those hailing from China making up the largest international group, according to a tally on Harvard’s International Office website.

Among those students is Fangzhou Jiang, 30, a student at Harvard’s Kennedy School, who said he couldn’t believe it when he heard that his university status was in jeopardy and immediately began to worry if his visa was still valid.

“I was absolutely shocked for quite a few minutes. I just never anticipated that the administration could go this far,” said Jiang, who is also the founder of an education consulting company helping foreign students gain admission to elite American universities. “Ever since I was young, when it comes to the best universities in the world, from a young age, I learned that it’s Harvard,” he said.

Ivy League schools like Harvard, Princeton and Yale are household names in middle class China, where American universities have for years been viewed as a path to a prestigious education and a leg-up in China’s fiercely competitive career-ladder.

China was the top source of international students in the US for 15 straight years since 2009, before it was surpassed by India just last year, according to figures from Open Doors, a US Department of State-backed database tracking international student enrollment.

Along the way, US-China educational ties have cultivated close relationships between Chinese and American academics and institutions, while US universities and industry are widely seen to have benefited from their ability to attract top talent from China, and elsewhere, to their halls.

Harvard has educated Chinese figures like former Vice Premier Liu He, who played a key role negotiating Trump’s phase one trade deal during the American president’s first term.

But those ties have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as the US began to see an increasingly assertive and powerful China as a technological rival and a threat to its own superpower status.

More than 277,000 Chinese students studied in the US during the 2023 to 2024 academic year, down from over 372,000 in the peak 2019-2020 year – a decline that coincides with the Covid-19 pandemic but also increasing friction between the two governments.

Meanwhile, rising nationalist sentiment and government emphasis on national security in China have led to a shift in perception about the value of American versus Chinese universities.

Reverse brain-drain

The Department of Homeland Security’s claims regarding Harvard’s institutional ties to entities and individuals with ties to military-related research are the latest move reflecting deep-seated concern in Washington about Chinese access to sensitive and military-applicable American technology via academia.

To crack down on the perceived threat of Chinese students conducting espionage on US soil, Trump introduced a ban during his first term that effectively prevented graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields from Chinese universities believed to be linked to the military from gaining visas to the US.

His first administration also launched the now defunct China Initiative, a national security program intended to thwart China’s intelligence activities in the US, including those aimed at stealing emerging technology from research universities.

The program, which drew comparisons to the McCarthy-era anti-Communism “red scare” of the 1950s, was cancelled by the Biden administration after facing widespread blowback for what was seen as over-reach and complaints that it fueled suspicion and bias against innocent Chinese Americans.

Trump’s broader tightening of US immigration policy during his second term has now unleashed a new wave of insecurity and uncertainty for many students and schools.

While those concerns are shared by international students from many countries, the heightened tensions between the two countries have elevated pressure on Chinese students and scholars – and the impact has already been seen.

Over the past year, at least a dozen high-profile academics with roots in China who were working in the US have returned to China and taken up posts at prominent universities in the country, CNN has found.

And for some students at the start of their academic and professional careers, the latest development leaves them unsure about what to do next.

Among them is Sophie Wu, a 22-year-old from China’s southern tech hub of Shenzhen, who was accepted at a graduate program at Harvard this fall, after finishing her undergraduate degree in the US. Wu said she felt “numb” after hearing the news.

“I did not expect that the administration would make such an irrational decision, and I also feel that it is more of a retaliation than a policy decision,” she told CNN. “International students are being held hostage for some political purpose.”

CNN —

There are things almost all autocrats do.

They discredit democratic election systems; they seek to delegitimize the judiciary and politicize the military.

The current administration is often accused of doing all this and more. President Donald Trump falsely claimed voter fraud in 2020; Vice President JD Vance told the New York Times this week it was “profoundly wrong” to say the Supreme Court can strike down presidential acts; and Trump plans to hold a vast military parade on his own birthday.

Those who worry that Trump is taking the country down an anti-democratic path had more reason for anxiety Thursday when he used two more staples of the strongman’s playbook.

Trump aimed his most stinging shot yet at higher education — a rival source of authority, free thought and facts that often clash with his version of reality. And he fueled fears he could enable the kind of corruption that rots democracies with an event that looked a lot like a move to profit from the presidency.

The escalation in Trump’s battle with Harvard University came as the administration barred its capacity to enroll foreign students. Such pressure echoes the actions of authoritarian leaders like MAGA hero Viktor Orbán of Hungary, who cracked down on the academy to enhance his own power.

Then, Trump appeared at his golf club in Virginia for dinner with investors from around the world who sunk millions of dollars into his cryptocurrency meme coin, drawing concerns that foreigners are enriching the US leader and buying access.

The pressure on America’s democratic institutions so far bears no comparisons with the deprivations of a true totalitarian society, where there’s a culture of fear, where neighbor fears neighbor and where an oppressive state imposes a deep psychological toll on citizens.

But these fresh administration moves involved the flexing of presidential power toward ends that might appear legally or ethically questionable. And they also fit into the category of presidential acts that ordinary citizens lack the capacity to influence — mirroring how autocrats corrode checks and balances by fostering cynicism about government institutions and disempowering the public.

A fierce war on Harvard

The administration’s new prohibitions on Harvard are the latest front in a multi-agency attack on the country’s oldest and most prestigious university — one of the few higher education institutions to resist administration pressure.

The Department of Homeland Security said the university could no longer enroll foreigners and that existing overseas students must transfer or lose their legal authorization to study in the United States. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of “perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes-pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ practices.”

The administration justifies its crackdown by saying that Harvard failed to adequately act against antisemitism during protests following the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel and during the subsequent Israeli assault on Hamas in Gaza. It also regards diversity, equity and inclusion programs that were introduced to make amends for dark aspects of the nation’s history as racist in themselves.

More broadly, Republicans have long argued that elite universities have become engines of extreme progressive values that perpetuate liberal power and what they regard as un-American values that discriminate against conservatives.

Trump has made a series of swings at Harvard, freezing more than $2 billion in research funding, accusing it of failing to protect Jewish students and threatening to sever its tax-exempt status. Harvard admits that it fell short in addressing antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias, but also that it needed to do more to address anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian sentiment. But it has refused to bow to pressure to intrude on its rights to open inquiry, free speech and conducting research, and it launched legal action.

The new barriers on foreign student enrollment represent a clear attempt to harm Harvard’s financial health and therefore its capacity to operate. Foreign fees are often used to subsidize lower tuition bills for American students. And Noem left zero doubt that the administration’s pressure on Harvard was an attempt to intimidate other educational institutions and to force them to obey Trump’s orders.

“Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country,” her statement said.

Harvard pledged to fight what it said was the administration’s “unlawful” behavior that undermines its academic and research mission, thereby guaranteeing yet another massive court fight over a key Trump second-term policy.

Ryan Enos, a Harvard University professor of government, told CNN’s Brianna Keilar that it was “outrageous” that the administration was preventing the university from accepting foreign students.

“It’s another pattern of the Trump administration taking authoritarian actions. In the United States, the president does not have the power to target people for punishment because he doesn’t like their politics,” Enos said. “He is targeting Harvard because he thinks he disagrees with them. It is a political vendetta.”

The administration’s pressure on elite universities follows a notorious period in which some of the Ivy League’s top leaders failed miserably to condemn antisemitism on campuses during anti-Israel protests. But the furor at universities was also often legitimate protest by many students and staff over Israel’s attacks in Gaza, which have killed tens of thousands of civilians and are still taking place.

The Trump administration, as part of its mass deportation program, has responded by rescinding visas of hundreds of foreign students it says are implicated in support for terrorism and Hamas in a way that is detrimental to US foreign policy interests. Multiple court challenges are underway, and in many cases, those targeted seem to have simply being exercising a right to speech or protest or were caught up in demonstrations by chance. The administration hasn’t produced material evidence of support for terrorism.

Trump’s assault on universities is natural fit for his political brand as an outsider and a populist who disdains elite opinion and progressive thought. He acts as an avatar for voters who despise establishments in areas of life that they often see as decrying traditional Christian, heartland values.

Universities are also sources of power, influence and academic rigor that often contradict Trump’s alternative facts and are among the institutions, along with the courts and the media, that can challenge the president’s power.

The crackdown on academic freedom and foreign students threatens, however, to erode America’s huge international advantage in research and may mean bright students vital to the pursuit of scientific breakthroughs will go elsewhere — possibly after the wooing of US foes like China. Curbs on foreign students also imperil the diversity of campus life and thought, which is critical to successful higher education institutions but runs counter to the political instincts of some of Trump’s top aides.

And in common with classic authoritarian-style leaders, the president’s move will hurt individuals swept up in the undertow of far greater political forces. In this case, foreign students currently at Harvard will now need to find a new school quickly or be kicked out of the US.

An ‘orgy of corruption’

The president’s dinner for the top holders of his $Trump meme coin is typical of the way in which ethical standards that most of his modern predecessors voluntarily observed are an afterthought in his administration.

Those norms are critical in retaining public confidence in the integrity of governing institutions and to the idea that each citizen has the same fair shot. Without such assurances, democracies quickly founder.

Trump’s cavalier attitude toward such matters is highlighted by his refusal to accept that he may be regarded as facing conflicts of interest after Qatar offered to give the US a 747 jet to serve as a new Air Force One. The jet would be turned over to his presidential library once he leaves office.

More immediate concerns surround the gala Thursday night at the Trump National Golf Club alongside a scenic stretch of the Potomac River in Virginia. The event was billed as “The most exclusive invitation in the world” and was open to 220 of the top investors in the $Trump meme coin. Initially, the website promoting the event advertised a private White House tour — an invitation that was later removed.

The occasion is particularly discomforting because the Trump family business profits from transaction fees on his meme coin. And CNN’s Allison Morrow reported Thursday that most of the top investors in the coin appear to be based overseas. Foreigners are not allowed by law to donate to US election campaigns. But the meme coin apparently allows them to buy access to the president with the potential of boosting his personal finances, even if it is not clear that Trump is violating the law.

“This is government policy up for sale. We have never seen this in the United States of America,” Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon told CNN’s Erin Burnett from a protest outside the Trump golf course on Thursday evening.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied Trump was doing anything wrong and argued that the dinner was on his “personal time” and was not an official White House event. She also said it was “absurd” to claim he was profiting off the presidency. “This president was incredibly successful before giving it all up to serve our country publicly. Not only has he lost wealth, but he also almost lost his life,” Leavitt said.

The president did indeed mercifully survive two assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign. But the idea he paid a financial price for his political career is highly questionable. Forbes Magazine journalist Dan Alexander ran an analysis for CNN’s “Erin Burnett Out Front” that found that Trump doubled his net worth to $5.4 billion between March 2021 and today.

Several other Democratic senators tried to whip up a public furor over the gala dinner. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts blasted an “orgy of corruption,” while Connecticut’s Chris Murphy said the event suggested that this was “the most corrupt White House in the history of the country.”

“Just because the corruption is playing out in public where everybody can see it doesn’t mean that it isn’t rampant, rapacious corruption. And what is happening tonight,” Murphy said, “is maybe the most corrupt of all the corruption.”

Murphy challenged Secretary of State Marco Rubio about the optics and implications of the dinner during a Senate hearing this week. “I’m not the social secretary,” Rubio replied, adding that he didn’t know anything about the dinner and that it was “not fair” to say foreigners bought access to the president.

Yet wealthy, powerful people demonstrably have the capacity to secure access to the president that regular citizens, whose only power is a single vote, lack.

That’s the antithesis of a functioning democracy.

CNN —

Dr. Alaa al-Najjar left her ten children at home on Friday when she went to work in the emergency room at the Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza.

Hours later, the bodies of seven children - most of them badly burned - arrived at the hospital, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. They were Dr. Najjar’s own children, killed in an Israeli airstrike on her family’s home, Gaza Civil Defense said. The oldest was 12, the youngest just three years old. The bodies of two more children – a 7-month-old and a two-year-old - remained trapped under the rubble as of Saturday morning.

Only one of her children – critically injured – survived. Dr. Najjar’s husband, himself a doctor, was also badly injured in the strike.

Civil defense and the health ministry say that the family’s home, in a neighborhood of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, was targeted by an Israeli airstrike.

In response to a CNN request for comment, the Israeli military said aircraft had “struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Yunis.” It said it was reviewing the claim civilians had been killed.

Gaza Civil Defense published graphic video from the scene of the strike. It showed medics lifting an injured man onto a stretcher as other first responders try to extinguish a fire engulfing the house. They recover the charred remains of several children from the debris and wrap them in white sheets.

‘Wiping out entire families’

Munir al-Barsh, Director-General of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said that Dr. Najjar’s husband had just returned home when the home was struck.

“Nine of their children were killed: Yahya, Rakan, Raslan, Gebran, Eve, Rival, Sayden, Luqman, and Sidra,” Barsh posted on X. He said her husband was in intensive care.

“This is the reality our medical staff in Gaza endure. Words fall short in describing the pain. In Gaza, it is not only healthcare workers who are targeted—Israel’s aggression goes further, wiping out entire families,” Barsh said.

Ahmad al-Farra, a doctor at the Nasser Medical Complex, told CNN that Dr. Najjar continued to work despite losing her children, while periodically checking on the condition of her husband and sole surviving child, Adam, who is 11.

Both the father and son underwent two surgeries at the hospital and are still receiving treatment, Farra said.

Youssef Abu al-Reesh, a senior official at the Health Ministry, said Dr. Najjar had left her children at home to “fulfill her duty and her calling toward all those sick children who have no place but Nasser Hospital.”

Reesh said that when he arrived at the hospital, he had seen her “standing tall, calm, patient, composed, with eyes full of acceptance. You could hear nothing from her but quiet murmurs of (glorification of God) and (seeking forgiveness).”

Dr. Najjar, 38, is a pediatrician, but like most doctors in Gaza, she has been working in the emergency room during Israel’s onslaught on the territory.

CNN —

After 19 months of pounding Gaza, Israel is now under growing pressure from unlikely quarters – some of its closest Western allies.

Their patience has worn thin over Israel’s decision to expand the war and, in the words of one Israeli minister, “conquer” the territory – a move paired with plans to forcibly displace Gaza’s entire population to the south and block all humanitarian aid for 11 weeks.

The United Kingdom has paused trade talks and sanctioned extremist settlers in the West Bank. Canada and France have threatened sanctions. And the European Union – Israel’s biggest trade partner – is reviewing its landmark Association Agreement with the country.

Aid groups have warned that the situation in Gaza is becoming catastrophic, with the United Nations’ humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher last week calling on the world to “act decisively to prevent genocide.”

Dozens of babies have died of malnutrition, according to Gaza’s health ministry, and more than 53,000 people – or 4% of the entire population – have been killed since Israel launched its war following the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas and its allies.

The fact that some of Israel’s closest allies are now pushing back more vocally marks a major shift in attitudes toward the country.

Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN that just two years ago, it would have been unimaginable for Europe to even talk about the possibility of rethinking the Association Agreement. “It was something that was widely seen as a taboo and unrealistic.”

The agreement, which covers various forms of cooperation between the two parties, including the free movement of goods and scientific collaboration, has been in place for 25 years. “The mere fact that this is being discussed seriously today is a sign of not just the increasing frustration, and I think also, let’s be quite clear, anger, in some European capitals over Israeli actions in Gaza,” said Lovatt.

The punitive steps threatened by the EU and other allies are designed in part to sway the domestic debate inside Israel, where society is already extremely divided over the war.

The government, propped up by hardliners from far-right parties, is determined to keep fighting in Gaza. But hundreds of thousands of Israelis demonstrate against the war each week, demanding the government agrees a ceasefire deal to release all the hostages still held in the strip.

In an opinion poll published by Israel’s Channel 12 broadcaster earlier this month, 61% of those surveyed favored ending the war for a deal that secures the hostage release, while only 25% supported the expanded military operation.

That notwithstanding, Arie Reich, a legal scholar at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University who specializes in international trade and EU law, said that external pressure on Netanyahu’s government may not have the desired effect.

“When foreign countries try to interfere in internal matters of another country, especially things that are very dear to them, such as their national security, it usually works as a boomerang, and it actually causes the people to support the government even more,” he said.

“There is a wide consensus in Israel that we want to release our hostages, and that we do not want to go back to where we were on October 6. We don’t want to have this threat of Hamas lingering over us,” Reich said.

But he added that the moves by some of Israel’s allies have made it clear that the “window of using military force is starting to close.”

“And maybe, if it goes on longer than that, I think it’s going to be very hard to maintain normal relations with many countries in the West,” he said.

Israel has so far brushed aside the threats from its Western allies. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused them of “offering a huge prize” to the October 7 attackers, while Israel’s foreign ministry said that “external pressure will not divert Israel from its path in the fight for its existence and security against enemies seeking its destruction.”

This determination to continue may be due to Netanyahu believing that he can, for now at least, rely on the United States for support.

And while the moves are diplomatically symbolic, critics expect little to change on the ground for Palestinians.

Omar Barghouti, the co-founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a global campaign aimed at pressuring Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian land, told CNN that unless Israel’s allies totally stop support for Israel, their actions will yield few results.

Short of a total arms embargo and a full suspension of economic relations, Israel is unlikely to change its ways, he said, arguing that Canada, France and the UK had been “complicit” in Israel’s actions in Gaza by providing it with “military, intelligence, economic, and diplomatic support.”

All three countries have longstanding agreements with Israel that include defense and security cooperation, although the detail of what exactly these contain is unclear.

The UK and France have suspended some arms licenses to Israel over the situation in Gaza but have continued to export military equipment worth tens of millions of dollars to Israel. Canada has said that no export permits on military goods to Israel have been issued since January 8, 2024.

Israel’s most powerful backer stands by it

As Israel’s most powerful ally, the US has the most sway over Netanyahu and his government. And while some in the Trump administration have criticized Israel over the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, there has been no indication the US would take any punitive actions against it.

It isn’t, however, a “foregone conclusion that the US will continue to always unequivocally back Israel,” Lovatt said.

“While I don’t see a rupture in relations, clearly, the arrival of the second Trump administration has created an interesting dynamic, given the influence of what I would call the ‘America Firsters,’ those in the MAGA world who want to put the US first in everything, and that has, to a certain extent, also applied to Israel,” he said.

The US has moved out of step with Israel on number of issues in recent weeks.

It has struck a ceasefire deal with Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels without first informing Israel; unilaterally negotiated with Hamas the release of US citizen Edan Alexander from Gaza; and, according to a Reuters report, has dropped its demand for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel as a condition for US investment and potential US arms deals.

Addressing Israel’s criticism over the deal with the Houthis, US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told Israeli media that the US “isn’t required to get permission from Israel” to get an agreement that protects its ships.

“Netanyahu has positioned himself as a master of the US political game, and as someone who’s best placed to manage and maintain tight Israel relations and to keep any US presidential administration on side. I think seeing some daylight between the Trump administration and the Israeli government clearly puts pressure on Netanyahu,” Lovatt said.

US officials told CNN that US President Donald Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with Netanyahu, but stressed these frustrations do not amount to a change in posture in terms of US support for Israel, a country which the president continues to view as one of America’s strongest allies.

There are signs that some in Israel are worried about the consequences of its actions in Gaza. The leader of Israel’s opposition left-wing Democrats party, retired Israeli general Yair Golan, warned on Tuesday that Israel is “on its way to becoming a pariah state.”

The impact of the pressure from the allies was on display on Sunday, when the Israeli military announced it would allow a “basic amount of food” to enter Gaza as it launched its new offensive in the strip, which Israel says is intended to pressure Hamas to release the hostages held there.

Netanyahu conceded on Monday that if “a situation of famine” arose in Gaza, Israel “simply won’t receive international support.”

In a statement posted to Telegram, he added that even US senators “who have been staunch, unconditional supporters of Israel for decades” had told him that “images of mass starvation” in Gaza would cost Israel their support.

‘More of a threat’

Even if the US won’t use its leverage to force Israel to change its strategy in Gaza in a more significant way, it doesn’t mean Europe can’t put pressure on Israel on its own, experts say.

The European Union is Israel’s biggest trading partner, accounting for roughly a third of its trade in goods.

A full suspension of the Association Agreement between the EU and Israel is unlikely, as it would require unanimous agreement of all 27 EU member states and several have already indicated they would not support it – including Hungary, a staunch supporter of Israel.

Reich said that under the terms of the agreement, both the EU and Israel can terminate it for whatever reason, or even without giving a reason.

“The thing is that within the EU, that would require consensus … and that would be very, very hard, because there are many countries, many (EU) member states that will not go along with this,” he said.

“So I think it’s more of a threat to put pressure (on Israel) and maybe they could manage some temporary suspension of some provisions, but to terminate it, I don’t think it can happen,” he added.

Public support for the country runs deep in many of the bloc’s member states, which makes it difficult for some European governments to push for harsher sanctions against Israel.

And, Lovatt said, many European countries are also aware of the fact that they may need Israel’s help in the future.

“Especially in a situation where European countries are increasingly fearful of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, but also the threat that Russia represents the rest of Europe, and (they) see Israel as an important source of weapons and technology,” he said.

While terminating the association agreement would require unanimity, it would only take a majority of EU states to force through a partial suspension of the agreement.

Even that could be painful for Israel because it could lead to higher tariffs on Israeli products or prevent Israel from taking part in coveted EU projects such as the Horizon Europe program, with more than $100 billion in funding available for research and innovation.

The EU has in the past used its power to put pressure on countries over human rights abuses – often for issues Lovatt says are a lot less serious than the current situation in Gaza.

“The bottom line is that until now, the EU has treated Israel with a degree of exceptionalism by not taking anywhere near the sort of steps that it has taken in other situations of human rights abuses or territorial annexation,” Lovatt said.

The families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza blasted the newly-picked head of the Shin Bet security agency after he reportedly voiced opposition to hostage deals.

According to Israel’s Channel 12 News, Maj. Gen. David Zini said in meetings of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) general staff: “I oppose hostage deals. This is a forever war.” The report does not provide a specific date for the Zini’s comments. Channel 12 says it was a position he repeated often over the past year.

“If the report is accurate, these are shocking statements, worthy of unequivocal condemnation, especially coming from someone who is expected to hold the fate of the hostages in his hands,” said the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in a statement on Friday.

In his current position as the head of the Training Command and General Staff Corps in the IDF, Zini has little influence on hostage negotiations and his personal beliefs are largely irrelevant to the process. But if confirmed as head of the Shin Bet, Zini could have a significant role considering the agency’s participation in previous rounds of indirect negotiations with Hamas.

“Appointing a Shin Bet chief who prioritizes (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu’s war over the return of the hostages is a sin upon a crime and an injustice to the entire people of Israel - a blow to the value of solidarity and the sacred duty to leave no one behind,” the forum said.

When asked for comment, the IDF said it “does not on comment on content discussed in General Staff deliberations.”

Zini’s career in the military has mostly been as a field officer with little experience in intelligence, which is a core aspect of the Shin Bet, officially called the Israel Security Agency.

Ruby Chen, the father of Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen, whose body is still held in Gaza, said on social media that “Netanyahu appoints to key positions people who lack the relevant skills in order to control the system.”

Netanyahu announced Zini’s nomination on Thursday, one day after Israel’s Supreme Court ruled that he had a conflict of interest in firing the previous Shin Bet chief, Ronen Bar, and could not appoint a replacement.

In its decision, the court said the firing “was made when the Prime Minister had a conflict of interest in light of the investigations into the affairs of his associates; that the decision was made without a factual foundation; and without a proper hearing being held for the Shin Bet head.”

On Thursday, the Attorney General said: “The Prime Minister acted contrary to legal guidance, there is serious concern that he acted when he is in a conflict of interest, and the appointment process is flawed.”

But Netanyahu proceeded with the appointment anyway. The Prime Minister’s Office issued a statement on Friday defending the decision. “This is an urgent security necessity, and any delay harms the security of the state and the safety of our soldiers,” it said. Netanyahu said on Friday that he has known Zini for years.

The choice of Zini as an active-duty general was also unprecedented, prompting the IDF’s Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir to issue a statement saying that Zini would retire “in the upcoming days” before he can take up the civilian Shin Bet post.

The pick appeared to surprise the country’s top general, who emphasized that “any discourse conducted by IDF soldiers with the political echelon must be approved by the Chief of General Staff.”

CNN —

Hours after the Al Haj bakery handed out its last piece of bread on Thursday, Jihad Al Shafie was still waiting, his hope of bringing some food to his family long gone.

Like many in the crowd standing outside the bakery in central Gaza, Al Shafie lined up early in the morning, anticipating freshly baked pita from the first deliveries of flour to enter the besieged territory since early March. He was forced to leave empty-handed, as many of the promised truckloads of food remained in southern Gaza, a dozen or so miles away.

“We see people waiting for bread, but no one is receiving any,” Al Shafie told CNN. “It’s vital that those in charge understand our suffering and act on it.”

For one hour on Thursday afternoon, the bakery “experienced unprecedented invasions,” according to the owner, as a mob descended on the facility in a scramble for food. Through the small window separating the workers inside from the crowd, desperate hands reached in, trying to get lucky enough to secure a bag of bread. The chaos vanished as quickly as the bread, leaving scores with nothing.

Ina’am Al Burdeini walked an hour from Al-Maghazi refugee camp to the bakery, only to find a crowd already there when she arrived. She, too, left empty-handed. “It’s exhausting, and we feel lost and abandoned,” said Al Burdeini, directing her anger both inside and outside of Gaza. “People are desperate. It’s time for action, not empty promises. Hamas get out!”

This week, Israel began allowing in the first trucks with food and humanitarian supplies since imposing a complete blockade of humanitarian goods on Gaza on March 2. More than 300 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since Monday, according to Israel’s Coordinator for Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which oversees deliveries.

It is a fraction of the aid that entered before the war, when 500 to 600 trucks per day came into Gaza, according to the United Nations. On Thursday, COGAT claimed “there is no food shortage in Gaza,” despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office saying this week that Israel was allowing “a basic amount of food” into Gaza “in order to prevent a humanitarian crisis.”

‘Needle in a haystack’

“The aid going in now is a needle in a haystack,” said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), on social media. “A meaningful & uninterrupted flow of aid is the only way to prevent the current disaster from spiraling further.”

And not all of the aid is reaching the Palestinian population, with some held up because of unsafe transit routes or looted on its way to distribution points. None of the trucks reached northern Gaza, where Israel has issued several evacuation warnings recently.

Late Thursday night, 30 aid trucks in southern and central Gaza were attacked and vandalized, according to Nahid Shuheiber, the head of the transport association in the territory. In Deir Al-Balah, armed gangs opened fire on the trucks and looted them, he said. When local security teams, backed by Hamas, arrived to secure the convoy, Hamas’ Government Media Office said multiple Israeli strikes targeted the site, killing six.

In a statement to CNN, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that an aircraft struck “several gunmen, including Hamas terrorists” next to humanitarian aid trucks in central Gaza. “The aircraft struck the gunmen following the identification. It should be emphasized that the aid was not harmed as a result of the strike,” the IDF said.

The World Food Programme (WFP) said 15 of its trucks were looted in southern Gaza while on their way to bakeries supported by the UN organization.

“Hunger, desperation, and anxiety over whether more food aid is coming, is contributing to rising insecurity,” said the WFP in a statement Friday. “We need support from the Israeli authorities to get far greater volumes of food assistance into Gaza faster, more consistently, and transported along safer routes, as was done during the ceasefire.”

The Palestinian NGOs Network condemned the looting of the humanitarian aid trucks. “The trucks, loaded with flour and intended to supply bakeries in Gaza City and the northern governorates, were looted — depriving children and families already enduring severe hunger of their basic food needs,” said the umbrella organization.

On Saturday, more of the very limited humanitarian aid entering Gaza was looted, with the United Arab Emirates’ aid campaign blaming the Israeli military for insisting that delivery trucks use unsafe routes.

Geolocated videos showed crowds of hundreds rushing towards one of the trucks on Saturday and people carrying off sacks of flour.

“This was due to the Israeli army’s insistence on enforcing unsafe crossing routes, during which the trucks were subjected to looting and theft within a ‘red zone’ area under Israeli control, resulting in the loss of most of their cargo,” according to Gallant Knight 3, the UAE’s aid operation.

A joint US-Israeli aid program, called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, is supposed to start operating four distribution sites before the end of the month. But the UN and other humanitarian organizations have refused to work with the new group.

The new plan has come under criticism from top humanitarian officials, who warn that it is insufficient, could endanger civilians and even encourage their forced displacement.

The UN’s aid chief, Tom Fletcher, said last week that time should not be wasted on an alternative Gaza aid plan, writing on X: “To those proposing an alternative modality for aid distribution, let’s not waste time: We already have a plan.”

On Friday, the Bakery Owners Association in Gaza announced that bakeries would refuse to operate “in light of the difficult circumstances facing the Gaza Strip,” calling on the WFP to distribute flour to families first.

The chairman of the association, Abdel Nasser Al-Ajrami, appealed to international organizations to “urgently intervene” with Israel to allow the entry of “flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and diesel fuel” so that bread is available for everyone.

Trouble in Bruges

When tourists say they wish they could take a piece of their favorite place home with them, sometimes they mean it a bit too literally.

Belgium’s picturesque city of Bruges has issued a request that tourists stop stealing cobblestones from its UNESCO-recognized medieval streets.

Local politician Franky Demon says an estimated 50 to 70 cobblestones disappear per month — even more during peak season — and it costs 200 euros (about $225) per square meter to replace them and fix the damage.

“While some may see this as harmless or quirky, the consequences are serious,” Demon told CNN. “The removal of cobblestones poses a clear safety risk to both residents and visitors. Missing or loosened stones create tripping hazards, and city workers must frequently be dispatched to carry out repairs.”

Demon said that one “perpetrator” apparently even took the time to replace a missing stone with a planted flower. “A whimsical gesture, but one that underscores a lack of respect for our shared heritage,” he said.

“We simply ask for respect. Walking through Bruges means stepping through centuries of history,” said Demon. “These cobblestones are not just pieces of stone — they are part of our city’s soul. We urge visitors to enjoy Bruges, but to leave its beauty intact for others.”

Like Venice, Barcelona and other historic European cities, Bruges has been struggling to cope with overtourism.

In 2019, the city voted to reduce the number of cruise ships that would be allowed to dock in the nearby port of Zeebrugge and ended tourism promotion campaigns in nearby destinations like Paris to discourage day-trippers.

Visitors to Bruges who want a memento of their vacation — maybe consider a box of Belgian chocolates instead?

Off the beaten path

Mass tourism has yet to discover Taroudant in Morocco. Giulia Bassanese

One way to avoid overtourism is to head to less expected locales.

While Syria might not be top of mind for a summer holiday, the fall of former president Bashar al-Assad’s regime has resulted in the country opening up to international visitors.

Turkish Airlines and Qatar Airways have launched routes to Damascus, and adventure travel outfitters are in-country to try to get in on the ground floor.

“Now Assad is gone I’m sure the tourism industry will grow so fast. And as soon as governments stop saying ‘Don’t go to Syria,’ tourism will explode,” local tourism operator Ayoub Alsmadi told CNN Travel.

Morocco’s Marrakech is one of the most beautiful destinations in the world, with its souks and mosques set against a desert backdrop.

But many of the same beautiful features can be found in the southwestern Moroccan town of Taroudant — a “little Marrakech” without the hordes of tourists.

Located an hour and a half east of Agadir, this sun-soaked town was founded in the 11th century. Taroudant is a place where you can sip tea at a family-run restaurant, explore a historic fortress, or just relax in a traditional riad courtyard house.

And if you’re looking for an underwater vacation, you don’t have to go to the Great Barrier Reef. The Philippines’ Apo Reef Natural Park is the second-biggest contiguous coral reef system in the world.

The reef is located in the Philippine Sea, 140 miles southeast of Manila, and is much less visited than its Australian cousin.

That may change, though, as the government of the Philippines has submitted Apo Reef for UNESCO consideration — meaning now is a great time to go.

Washington —

“Nobody should die like that.”

It was Starlette Thomas’ first thought when she watched a bystander’s video on social media of George Floyd dying under the knee of a White police officer.

And it was the spark that propelled her out of her office and into the streets of Washington, DC, where she joined the throngs in chanting three words that almost instantly galvanized into both a plea and a rallying cry:

Black Lives Matter.

In the days after the murder on Monday, May 25, 2020, along a Minneapolis road, hundreds of thousands flooded streets across the nation in protest. Most had been isolating for months as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.

But the death of yet another Black person at the hands of police seemed to shatter a dam in the American conscious.

The 7-acre green space just north of the White House, known as Lafayette Square, had been a rallying place for change for more than a century, from women’s suffrage marches in 1917 to the fight for racial equality and gay rights half a century later.

And so it was where protesters gathered to mourn the death of this 46-year-old father, George Floyd.

For Thomas, standing among the thousands of Americans of all races and faiths and demanding racial equality changed the way she thought about criminal justice and her role as a pastor serving a nearby church.

It was “this cathartic release, this need to demonstrate, to protest, to yell and to not hold the grief that this had triggered,” she said.

As the crowd chanted the names of Black lives lost to police violence – Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor – it began to feel to Thomas like a prayer.

“That was a holy experience for me that is unmatched,” she said.

The daytime demonstrations were largely peaceful.

But as night fell on Washington – and other American cities – their tone changed.

After nights of clashes, then-President Donald Trump, known for issuing directives and invectives through social media, fired off a series of posts shortly before 1 a.m. on Friday, May 29, 2020.

He condemned protests in Minneapolis that had become violent.

“These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd,” he wrote before pivoting to a stark ultimatum:

“Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”

Outside the White House that evening, people began throwing rocks. Some tried to topple police barricades. The Secret Service rushed Trump and his family to the executive mansion’s bunker.

“Nobody came close to breaching the fence,” Trump posted the following day. “If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”

Trump’s allusions to police brutality – the very thing demonstrators were protesting – only seemed to rile them and underscore what was at stake.

It was also prescient.

Demonstrations kept swelling through the weekend. Offices and other buildings around Lafayette Square were boarded up. But it didn’t stop the destruction.

The windows of Michelle Brown and Linda Neumann’s tea shop by the White House were smashed and the café set on fire, they told an influential city magazine. Even so, Brown quickly took to social media to underscore her support for those peacefully demanding change:

“Before anyone puts a single word in our mouths,” she wrote: “Black lives matter.”

“There’s insurance to cover things like this,” Neumann told the magazine. “We are both just so sad and heartbroken about what’s happening in the country and how things came to this.”

Then, late Sunday night, an arsonist set fire to the basement of St. John’s Church, a landmark crowning the top of Lafayette Square and often referred to as the “presidents church” because so many have worshipped there.

The physical damage was minimal. But the flames ignited a series of events that soon would alter the landscape of the district itself.

The following day, officials in Hennepin County, Minnesota, ruled Floyd’s death a homicide, codifying what many already sensed:

Floyd’s life had been taken, and someone should be held accountable.

Protesters again gathered outside the White House. Only this time, they were met by police.

The law enforcement presence was subtle at first. Officers observed from the park as demonstrators waved signs and chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot!” and “No Justice! No Peace.”

But as the day wore on, the police presence grew. Journalists noticed.

“These protests until now have been entirely calm,” CNN correspondent Alex Marquardt told Wolf Blitzer.

“In fact, even as this escalation is happening, as these police come up to confront the protesters, we have not seen the protesters respond in any sort of way, by throwing any sort of projectiles …

“But Wolf, there’s also a fear of escalation.”

Then, the mood shifted. Hundreds of National Guard troops staged near the park. A line of mounted police officers towered above the protesters and kept watch.

The White House announced Trump would make a statement in the Rose Garden.

The officers, Marquardt said, began to pull on gas masks.

In seconds, things went from peaceful to pandemonium.

Law enforcement rushed the crowds. Protesters screamed and scattered. People fell. Others took a knee before the advancing line of police.

Many retreated toward St. John’s Church.

As police descended, Thomas thought of the 1965 civil rights march to Montgomery, Alabama, that saw a young activist named John Lewis beaten bloody on a bridge in Selma.

“All that was missing was a water hose and some dogs,” she recalled. “We’re marching to advance a cause – to say you can’t just kill people without due process – and you’re pushing us back with violence.”

Tear gas canisters cracked like thunder, and flash bangs echoed across White House lawns. Somehow, the Rose Garden maintained a relative tranquility, and from it, Trump spoke to the American people.

“I will fight to protect you. I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,” he said as helicopters whirred.

Trump called on mayors and governors across the country to “dominate the streets” and “establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled.”

Then, he left the stage and made his way across the park.

Standing in front of the boarded-up St. John’s Church, the president posed with a Bible, holding it in the air.

“We have a great country,” he told reporters.

It wasn’t long before pundits launched debates over Trump’s sacred prop, critics argued about the use of active-duty military against Americans exercising First Amendment rights and politicians lined up to assign blame.

In the office of the mayor of Washington, DC, the response was quieter as officials moved into action to make clear to the world – and the president living down the street – the city’s undisputed stance on the moral moment gripping the nation.

First, they called Keyonna Jones.

An artist born and raised in Southeast DC, Jones – like many Americans – had been struggling to reconcile her own struggles in the pandemic with the injustice of Floyd’s death, she said.

All the same, she answered the phone. And in less than 24 hours, she was across town on 16th Street NW.

With an army of volunteers, friends, neighbors and municipal workers, Jones began to emblazon the two blocks leading directly to the White House with 50-foot letters that spelled out the moment’s words of empowerment so indelibly, they could be seen from space:

On June 5 – just 11 days after Floyd took his last breath – the district officially unveiled Black Lives Matter Plaza. The date happened to coincide with the birthday of Breonna Taylor, the Black American whose life had been cut tragically short that March in an encounter with police.

“We know what’s going on in our country,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. “We had the opportunity to send that message loud and clear on a very important street in our city … And that message is to the American people that Black Lives Matter, that Black humanity matters, and we as a city raise that up as part of our values.”

Other cities followed suit. In Montgomery, Alabama, the phrase marked the spot where enslaved people once were auctioned. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the same kind of yellow letters were painted along Greenwood Avenue in homage to the lives stolen in the 1921 Race Massacre. New York commissioned a mural along 5th Avenue, just outside Trump Tower. More murals appeared in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.

They often were spurned. Many were vandalized. And some people, including Trump, saw them as divisive. He called Manhattan’s mural a “symbol of hate.”

Even some within the Black Lives Matter movement declared the murals “performative,” an attempt by public officials to absolve themselves of the immensely hard work of rooting out systemic racism.

“I think art is part of activism,” countered Jones, the artist. “It’s a universal language – people will see it, people will feel it and it’s starting a conversation that may not have happened.”

In its early days, John Lewis – the bloodied young activist who’d become a senior statesman representing Georgia in the US Congress – walked along DC’s BLM Plaza. The 80-year-old was battling pancreatic cancer, but he was determined to see the mural in person, a spokesperson said.

Forty days later, he died.

The district the following year spent millions making the mural a permanent installation, replacing traditional asphalt with colored pavers to spell out its eponymous phrase. The goal, the mayor said, was to transform “the mural into a monument.”

In its quieter moments, the public art acted as a beacon, calling on Americans – together – to mourn, celebrate, argue, strategize and reflect on the ongoing fight against racism in the United States and the nation’s commitment to equality.

And, sure enough, it outlasted the pandemic. And the trial and conviction of Floyd’s murderer. And the entire Biden administration. And Trump’s return this year to the White House.

Then, after nearly five years of the plaza hosting moments both horrifying and holy, a Republican congressman from Georgia introduced a bill that would have withheld federal funding from Washington, DC, unless the mural was erased.

Facing political pressure unlikely to soon relent, Bowser’s office ultimately announced the artwork – with the plaza’s official designation – would be removed.

On a Sunday this March, dozens of visitors paused at the intersection of 16th and I Streets NW to take final photos before construction crews pulverized Black Lives Matter Plaza into dust and piles of rock.

“To me, this is part of our history,” one man told CNN in those final days. “It’s showing that we are trying to make progress and then they’re gonna tear it down? That doesn’t make sense.”

As Thomas watched the construction crews and excavators, she felt gutted and angry. In the nearly five years since Floyd’s death, she’d opted against preaching from the pulpit and instead ministered directly to activists and advocates leading protest movements across the country.

Witnessing the ordered destruction, she wondered: “Are you thinking if you dig this up … you can just erase what we’ve done here?”

CNN

Then, in full view of the workers, Thomas picked up a chunk of the mural and walked away.

It was “an act of defiance, an act of resistance,” she said. “You can’t erase memory. You can’t erase conviction.”

Jones felt much the same way. Five years after her artwork drew global attention, the United States has seemingly returned to its status quo, she said, with conversations about – and, more importantly, actions toward – racial equality fading again into the background.

Still, the artist said, her father recently reminded her of a speech by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader who rushed to but could not save a dying Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

In the speech, Jackson invoked the biblical boy David who fells the giant Goliath and encouraged Americans to continue to fight systems of injustice and not to be brought down by the “margin of despair.”

“We have to recognize that we’re Davids,” Jones said. “There are rocks laying around that we can use to defeat the system.”

We just have to pick them up.

Russia launched a deadly aerial assault across Ukraine, targeting the capital with missiles and drones for a second night in a row, as the two sides carried out an exchange of hundreds of prisoners of war.

At least eleven people were killed across Ukraine in attacks overnight into Sunday, including three people in the Kyiv capital region, Ukrainian authorities said, a day after officials reported at least 13 dead across Ukraine as a result of Russian attacks.

Officials said 43 people were injured across the country, including 21 in the capital city and greater capital region. Children were among those injured and killed.

“A difficult Sunday morning in Ukraine after a sleepless night. The most massive Russian air attack in many weeks lasted all night,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on social media platform X.

In the capital Kyiv, air raid sirens blared for hours and residents were warned to stay in shelters in the early hours of Sunday as officials said the city faced a second night in a row of drone and missiles attacks. Civilian buildings in multiple districts were damaged as Russia mounted an attack using drones and rockets, authorities said.

The onslaught on the country and its capital comes as international pressure mounts on Russian President Vladimir Putin to accept a ceasefire proposal and end his more than three-year war.

Kyiv and Moscow earlier this month held their first direct talks since soon after the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Those talks instead ended with an agreement for the exchange of prisoners, which began Friday and is expected to last three days.

Since the start of that exchange, Russian attacks have targeted regions across Ukraine, with the “main focus” being on the capital Kyiv, according to Ukraine’s Air Force.

Overnight into Sunday, Russian strikes hit at least 22 locations, the air force said. Russia launched 69 missiles and 298 drones, of which 47 missiles and 266 drones were intercepted, it added.

On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his condolences to families and loved ones of the injured. “It was a difficult night for all of Ukraine,” he said.

At least 18 other people were injured in Kyiv in attacks overnight into Saturday, according to police.

Ukrainian parliament member Kira Rudik told CNN Saturday she spent the night hiding “under the stairs” in Kyiv during the overnight bombardment. “It was terrifying, it felt honestly like Armageddon, the explosions were everywhere,” she said.

Prisoner swap

Over 600 Russian and Ukrainian servicemen were released Saturday as part of the second phase of the agreed prisoner exchange.

Videos released by the Ukrainian Coordination Center for Treatment of Prisoners of War showed the hundreds of released men, most with shaved heads and draped in Ukrainian flags, hugging each other and calling their loved ones on the phone.

Almost 800 people were released on Friday during the first phase of the swap.

The agreement to release 1,000 prisoners on each side was the only significant outcome of the meeting between Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul last week.

Olena, a Ukrainian woman whose husband Yuriy spent six months in Russian captivity, finally reunited with him on Saturday after he was released in the prisoner swap. A video posted by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense shows her running to find her husband and hugging him tightly once she does.

“This is the best day. I was running, looking for him, screaming. I am very grateful,” Olena said in the video. The day before she reunited with Yuriy, she had asked several of the released Ukrainian prisoners of war if any of them recognized her husband, but none of them were able to, leaving her very distressed.

Meanwhile, Russia said that it also was attacked by Ukrainian drones.

Russia’s Defense Ministry on Sunday said it intercepted or destroyed around 100 attack drones. Most of those destroyed were over Russia’s central and southern regions, with 13 over the Moscow and Tver regions, the ministry said.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin later said on Telegram that the number of drones destroyed or intercepted near the capital had risen to 11, according to Reuters.

The defense ministry a day earlier claimed it had destroyed 94 Ukrainian UAVs over Russian territory, mostly over the Belgorod and Bryansk regions. Some UAVs were also shot down over the Kursk, Lipetsk, Voronezh and Tula regions too, it added.

The governor of the Tula region, Dmitry Miliaev, said Saturday three people were injured, including two who were hospitalized.

The Istanbul meeting was initially proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in response to a ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Kyiv’s European allies – which many saw as a clear attempt by the Kremlin leader to distract and delay.

Ukraine and its allies demanded that Russia agree to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Istanbul, but there was no major breakthrough.

President Donald Trump addressed graduates at the US Military Academy in West Point, New York, this morning, making his second college commencement speech of the year.

It came as his administration scours the country’s military academies for course offerings, clubs and books deemed unsuitable under Trump’s anti-DEI initiatives. The president is also overseeing a wider shake-up of the Pentagon and the national security establishment.

If you missed the speech, here are some key takeaways:

Getting political: Trump didn’t shy away from playing politics and addressing controversial topics during his speech to the cadets.

Trump said that by banning diversity initiatives and transgender people from serving in the military, he was helping “liberate” the troops.

“We’ve liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings,” Trump said. “There will be no more ‘critical race theory’ or ‘transgender for everybody’ forced onto our brave men and women in uniform.”

Trump also slammed military readiness under his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and claimed he had “rebuilt” the nation’s armed forces.

Touting US military prowess: The president called the graduates “winners” and congratulated them on joining “the greatest and most powerful army the world has ever known.”

Trump’s “Golden Dome”: Trump again claimed that a “Golden Dome” missile defense system will be complete before he leaves office.

Experts have told CNN the president’s vision for a cutting-edge missile shield to protect from long-range strikes — inspired by Israel’s Iron Dome but intended to protect a country about 450 times larger — is economically and strategically ill-advised.

Lighter moments: The president brought multiple cadets onstage to celebrate their accomplishments, including Army Golden Knights quarterback Bryson Daily and Chris Verdugo, a cadet who set a record in a grueling 18.5-mile march.

Trump also issued a pardon for all West Point cadets on restriction for minor offenses, continuing a longstanding tradition of presidents who deliver the commencement address.

The Trump administration has put more than 100 officials at the National Security Council at the White House on administrative leave on Friday as part of a restructuring under interim national security adviser and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, according to two US officials and another source familiar with the matter.

CNN previously reported that a significant overhaul of the body in charge of coordinating the president’s foreign policy agenda was expected in the coming days, including a staff reduction and a reinforced top-down approach with decision-making concentrated at the highest levels.

An email from NSC chief of staff Brian McCormack went out around 4:20 p.m. informing those being dismissed they’d have 30 minutes to clean out their desks, according to an administration official. If they weren’t on campus, the email read, they could email an address and arrange a time to retrieve their stuff later and turn in devices.

The email subject line read: “Your return to home agency,” indicating that most of those affected were detailed to the NSC from other departments and agencies.

On Thursday, Rubio convened a meeting with principals, which raised speculation that it was about the re-organization, the official said. And on Friday at 3:45 p.m., shortly before the email went out, senior directors were summoned to a meeting with Rubio.

A flurry of emails from those leaving then started going out with personal contact information.

With this happening on a Friday afternoon before a long holiday weekend, the official called it “as unprofessional and reckless as could possibly be.”

Those put on leave include career officials, as well as political hires made during the Trump administration.

In recent weeks staffers were being re-interviewed by the Office of the Presidential Personnel as the reshaping of the office was taking place, sources said. One of the questions asked was what officials thought was the appropriate size of the NSC, one source said.

Staffed by foreign policy experts from across the US government, the NSC typically serves as a critical body for coordinating the president’s foreign policy agenda.

But under President Donald Trump, the NSC’s role has been diminished, with the overhaul expected to further reduce its importance in the White House.

Earlier this month, Mike Waltz – who previously led the NSC – was removed from his role in the first major staff shakeup of the new administration. Trump announced that he would nominate Waltz to serve as UN ambassador and Rubio would replace him on an acting basis at the NSC.

Waltz had been on shaky ground within the administration – having lost most of his influence in the West Wing – after he inadvertently added a journalist to a messaging app group chat about highly sensitive military strikes.

Even before the Signal fiasco, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles had been privately unimpressed with Waltz. And weeks before he was out, his influence internally had been waning, illustrated best by Trump’s decision to dismiss several staffers from the NSC at the urging of far-right activist Laura Loomer, who told him they were disloyal.

Barely a week into her tenure as Washington, DC’s top federal prosecutor, Jeanine Pirro faced an urgent test – overseeing the investigation into the murders of two Israeli Embassy staffers outside the city’s Jewish museum.

Pirro’s response to the young couples’ murder was under the microscope, as it was her first opportunity to enter the public eye no longer as a Fox News host but as a high-ranking government official leading the charge to bring justice after a public assassination.

Her quick command over the investigation garnered high marks from Justice Department officials. Prosecutors who work for her felt cautiously encouraged.

But she’s also getting the benefit for who she is not: Ed Martin, her norm-busting, social media free-wheeling predecessor who drew attention for his email screeds to employees and letters threatening to investigate Democratic members of Congress and liberal groups.

Like Martin, Pirro enjoys a close relationship with President Donald Trump and is expected to deviate little from the top priorities Martin was pursuing like immigration enforcement and reducing crime in the nation’s capital. But top officials at the Justice Department found Martin’s antics problematic at times.

Pirro’s marked difference in style, at least so far, has been welcome to officials at DOJ headquarters and prosecutors who work for her, many of whom are still exhausted by Martin’s tumultuous tenure.

“Whew, thank goodness,” one official remarked when asked about Pirro’s handling of the murder investigation.

Pirro gets praise for investigation, charges

A longtime media personality, the interim US attorney had so far only spoken through social media posts and press releases. One of the posts – a video on X criticizing the fact that her prosecutors had to join a paid “water club” to drink from a water cooler at the office – was particularly popular, officials inside the office told CNN, and people working there appreciated the notion despite feeling slightly annoyed by her method of delivery.

But her appearance Wednesday was far more traditional, as she and Attorney General Pam Bondi arrived at the Capital Jewish Museum soon after a man fired point blank at 26-year-old Sarah Milgrim and her boyfriend, 30-year-old Yaron Lischinsky, killing both.

Pirro’s decision to go to the scene of the shooting Wednesday night with little publicity or fanfare earned her respect inside the US attorney’s office, one person told CNN. She stood silently behind the attorney general as she addressed reporters, trying to maintain her composure but visibly shaken by the grisly murder at the museum.

Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has previously been criticized by Republicans for crime in the city, has been relieved by the how smoothly the shared investigation has been conducted, and that Pirro, Bondi and Bowser found a mutual respect for the work each was doing under the immense pressure they faced, sources with knowledge of their relationship told CNN.

“A young couple at the beginning of their life’s journey, about to be engaged in another country, had their bodies removed in the cold of the night in a foreign city in a body bag,” Pirro said Thursday from a lectern in her office.

She continued; “And I am not unaware, based upon my own background, of the repercussions of this kind of case. This is the kind of case that picks at old sores and old scars, because these kinds of cases remind us of what has happened in the past that we can never and must never forget.”

A spokesperson from the DC US Attorney’s Office said, “Judge Pirro has a history of fighting crime for over three decades and will continue to utilize her expertise in implementing the highest standards to assess and prosecute cases. She expects nothing less from her staff. Her job right now is to bring Law And Order to DC and make it safe for everyone.”

“As for this case, it is of the greatest import that the evidence collected be assessed and analyzed in a sterile courtroom setting and not in a publicized political setting,” the spokesperson added.

Case has a long road ahead

The murder investigation is still in its initial phase, and department officials, including Pirro, have said they are looking to bring potential hate crime or terrorism charges against the suspect, Elias Rodriguez.

But even if the case went to trial with the charges filed Thursday, Rodriguez could face the death penalty.

If the Justice Department does choose to seek capital punishment, it will be a major legal and political test for Pirro and the US Attorney’s Office, putting the case on a long path to trial that would need to be carefully handled in a largely liberal-leaning city.

The federal court in the District of Columbia hasn’t had a death penalty trial since 2003, when Rodney L. Moore was convicted of 10 murders and Kevin L. Gray was convicted of 19 murders. The jurors said they couldn’t agree unanimously on sentences of death for the two men rather than life imprisonment.

People close to the office felt encouraged by the fact that an experienced national security prosecutor, Jeffrey Nestler, was assigned to handle the possible death penalty case and was at the scene of the crime by midnight Wednesday to oversee evidence collection. Several other top prosecutors within the office had either left the Justice Department since the Trump presidency began or had been fired or demoted during Martin’s tenure.

Rodriguez has not entered a formal plea in court.

President Donald Trump signed four nuclear energy-related executive orders on Friday that will speed up reactor testing, allow the Departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federally owned land, overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and boost the United States’ mining and enrichment of uranium, a senior White House official said.

The president also signed an order to restore what the White House called “gold-standard science,” which comes as the administration has cut billions in federal grants that fund scientific research and slashed staffing at several science-focused agencies.

“We’re signing tremendous executive orders today that really will make us the real power in this industry, which is a big industry,” Trump said during an Oval Office signing ceremony.

The actions come as Trump’s proposed budget calls for cutting over $400 million from the Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum — who, along with nuclear energy company executives, joined Trump in the Oval Office — lamented what he said has been “over regulation” and heralded venture capital investment in the industry. He went on to praise Trump for committing to “energy dominance” that he said would allow the US to “win the AI arms race with China.”

“What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50,” he added.

One nuclear-related executive order speeds up reactor testing at Department of Energy national laboratories, expediting applications and review processes and enabling a pilot program for construction over the next two years, the official told reporters ahead of the Oval Office signing. A second order aims to reduce regulations for the Departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federal land, which the official said would allow “for safe and reliable nuclear energy to power and operate critical defense facilities and AI data centers.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pointed to what he said is a national security imperative.

“By having small modular nuclear capabilities, which are rapidly being fielded, that we can use on our bases here and around the world, we’re creating an environment where, if things happen elsewhere, the military can be reliable,” he said.

A spokesperson for the White House Office of Science and Technology said the new reactors would be “small and advanced.”

Trump will also require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission – the federal body that licenses nuclear reactors – to make decisions on nuclear reactor licenses within 18 months through a third executive order.

A fourth order “is focused on reinvigorating the US nuclear industrial base,” which the official said will allow the US to “start mining and enriching uranium and expanding domestic uranium conversion and enrichment capacities.”

However, the US is years away from getting its enrichment capabilities up and running at full capacity. As CNN has reported, until 2023, the US got the vast majority of its enriched uranium from Russia. A bipartisan law passed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine put a stop to that, and scientists and companies are racing to produce it at home.

Trump wrote that the the administration seeks to “facilitate increased deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies, such as Generation III+ and IV reactors, modular reactors, and microreactors, including by lowering regulatory and cost barriers to entry,” and it also plans to increase US nuclear energy capacity from around 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

The executive orders do not include removing or replacing NRC commission members, the official said. But pressed on if the actions would result in any reduction in staff, the official said, “Reduction in staff is undetermined at this point, but the executive orders do call for a substantial reorganization of the organization.”

The text of the order reforming the NRC, released later Friday, said that “the current structure and staffing of the NRC are misaligned with the Congress’s directive that the NRC shall not unduly restrict the benefits of nuclear power,” directing them to consult with the Department of Government Efficiency to “reorganize the NRC to promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology.”

“The NRC shall undertake reductions in force in conjunction with this reorganization, though certain functions may increase in size consistent with the policies in this order, including those devoted to new reactor licensing,” the order stated.

DOGE has been synonymous with sweeping cuts across the federal government.

The order aimed at reforming the NRC also said the organization “has failed to license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than ever,” and calls for them to “adopt science-based radiation limits.”

“Instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to insulate Americans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion,” the order stated.

Asked about the timeline of getting new reactors online, the official said that the administration is looking to test and deploy nuclear reactors within the remainder of Trump’s term.

Eighteen people were injured, four critically, in a knife attack Friday in the German city of Hamburg, authorities said.

Hamburg police said they have arrested a 39-year-old German woman, who they believe acted alone in carrying out the attack at the city’s Central Station, after a major police operation. She is in police custody and expected to be brought to a court on Saturday, police said.

Seven people were “badly injured,” while seven others were “lightly injured,” police said. The victims are aged between 19 and 85 years old.

The four critically injured, who include a 24-year-old female, 24-year-old male, 52-year-old female and 85-year-old female, are in a stabilized condition, police said in an update on Saturday.

Investigations into the incident are ongoing. Police said there was “concrete” evidence that the suspect suffers from a mental illness.

In a statement late on Friday, Hamburg police said the attacker had acted “apparently indiscriminately, stabbed passersby, injuring some of them critically.”

Video footage from the scene filmed by CNN’s affiliate RTL Germany shows people in forensic suits inspecting the area while police gather in the train station.

Following the attack, Germany’s Friedrich Merz thanked the city’s emergency responders for their assistance and said that his “thoughts are with the victims and their families,” according to federal government spokesperson Stefan Kornelius.

Federal Minister of the Interior Alexander Dobrindt also said his thoughts were with the victims and thanked the emergency services. “It is shocking when travelers are attacked in a treacherous and cowardly manner,” Dobrindt said.

Hamburg’s Central Station is the busiest passenger railway station in Germany, with more than 550,000 travelers per day, according to the city’s website.

Germany has faced rising rates of knife crime in recent years, with some incidents stirring up tensions over migration ahead of parliamentary elections in February.

Some in the country were concerned by a series of high-profile attacks allegedly carried out by asylum seekers or migrants.

In January, a 28-year-old man from Afghanistan was arrested following a knife attack in the German city of Aschaffenburg in which two people were killed, including a toddler.

Last year, a Syrian man turned himself in and confessed to stabbing to death three people and wounding several others at a festival in the western German city of Solingen.

Novak Djokovic became just the third man in the Open era to win 100 ATP singles titles on Saturday, defeating Hubert Hurkacz 5-7, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-2) in the final of the Geneva Open.

The 24-time grand slam winner joins Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer as the only men to have achieved the feat.

“I want to thank my wife and my kids for coming for three days only on the school break, cutting the school for one day, just to be with me,” Djokovic said in his on court interview.

“My team, the only thing I can say is thank you for being with me in the good times but also in the bad times. Today was very challenging to stay with me on the court because I was going off at you quite a lot … so I want to thank you for staying here and earning with me this victory number 100.”

Since claiming his 99th title when he won the gold medal in the men’s singles at the 2024 Olympics in Paris eight months ago, Djokovic has endured a difficult run of form. He has particularly struggled on clay, recently exiting the Monte-Carlo Masters and Madrid Open in his first match of each tournament.

And for much of Saturday’s match, it seemed as if the milestone would elude the Serb once again.

At 2-2 in the first set, he was unable to capitalize on two break points and that came back to haunt him when Hurkacz took the set thanks to a double fault from Djokovic in the 12th game.

But as the match progressed, Djokovic – who turned 38 on Thursday – showed the kind of resolute determination which appeared to have deserted him of late, breaking Hurkacz four times in a tiebreak after each player had held serve throughout the second set.

Having been broken by Hurkacz in the first game of the third set, it looked for a long time as though the win was slipping away from Djokovic again. But his quality came to the fore again, and he broke back to make it 4-4 before winning another tiebreak.

“I know it’s a bitter taste in the mouth to lose the match like this,” Djokovic told Hurkacz in his on-court interview afterward. “I think that you were definitely for most of the match, the better player.”

The victory means that, remarkably, the Serbian’s 100th title comes against a player coached by Nicolas Massú, the Chilean former world No. 9 whom Djokovic beat to win his very first ATP title in 2006.

Djokovic will now turn his attention to the French Open, where he will be aiming to win a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam. He faces American Mackenzie McDonald in the first round, which begins on Sunday.

The apparent sound made when the Titan submersible imploded in June 2023 has been revealed in new footage released Thursday by the Marine Board of Investigation, the US Coast Guard’s highest level of inquiry.

Cameras on the sub’s mother ship captured the moment when Wendy Rush – whose husband Stockton founded OceanGate, the company which built the ill-fated vessel, and was one of five people who died in its implosion – heard a faint cracking sound similar to a car door slamming.

“What was that bang?” she says, turning to the people next to her.

At that point, the sub had reached a depth of about 3,300 meters and was about 90 minutes into its descent to the ocean floor to give passengers on board an up-close view of the Titanic.

That “bang” is thought to be the moment the sub imploded. However, moments later, the crew on the support ship received a message from the sub saying it had dropped two weights – which may have created the false impression it was still operating normally.

Chris Roman, a professor at the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography, told CNN the message about the weights may have been sent shortly before the implosion, but due to a delay was only seen by the support vessel afterwards.

Every system which transmits data through the water has “some inherent buffering or delay related to how they do the signal timing or processing,” he explained.

“If the ‘weights dropped’ message was sent a few seconds before the implosion … the computer may not show the message immediately when it is received. The timing is tight, but possible. It really depends on the system they were using.”

Six seconds after that message, the mother ship lost contact with the sub, according to the timeline established by authorities investigating the doomed expedition.

An international search operation was launched to find the sub. US Coast Guard

When the sub failed to resurface, a dramatic international search and rescue mission unfolded in the remote waters several hundred miles southeast of Newfoundland.

Authorities found the Titan’s wreckage on the floor of the North Atlantic Ocean days later, several hundred yards from the Titanic’s remains.

Rush, businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son, Suleman; businessman Hamish Harding; and French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet were all killed.

Since the implosion, the sub’s fate has been held up by some as an example of the dangers of hubris and greed.

Testimony given during the hearings into the disaster painted a damning portrait of OceanGate and Rush, who charged passengers about $250,000 per dive despite several concerns being raised about the sub’s durability.

Two documentaries scheduled for release in the coming weeks – one produced by the BBC and the other by Netflix – will further investigate the causes behind the disaster.

Sunderland secured promotion to the Premier League on Saturday after defeating Sheffield United 2-1 with an extraordinary injury-time winner in the “most valuable match” in soccer, as the Championship play-off final is known.

For much of the game, Sunderland was trailing 1-0 after Sheffield United took the lead early on through a sweeping counterattacking move finished off by Tyrese Campbell.

But the Blades spurned several chances to put the game beyond Sunderland’s reach and the Black Cats equalized in the 76th minute as Eliezer Mayenda rifled the ball into the net.

And 19-year-old Tom Watson completed Sunderland’s unlikely comeback deep into injury-time, propelling one of English soccer’s most historic clubs back into the Premier League for the first time since 2017 and sending its fans inside Wembley Stadium into delirium.

Since that relegation in 2017, the Black Cats even suffered a four-season-long stint in League One, an ignominy depicted in the popular Netflix show “Sunderland ‘Til I Die.”

They eventually won promotion back to the Championship in 2022 and will now join Leeds United and Burnley in securing promotion back to the Premier League this season.

“I think my celebration says it all,” Watson, who is leaving Sunderland to join Brighton, told broadcaster Sky Sports. “Just look around, it’s unbelievable. We’ll see each other in the Premier League next year.

“I’ve been thinking about it for weeks. My story was written when I came off the bench. I couldn’t have pictured it any better.”

Sunderland was on the back foot from the very start of the game – in the opening two minutes, its club captain Luke O’Nien was forced off with a shoulder injury as he tried to defend against Kieffer Moore’s header. The Black Cats’ only consolation as O’Nien walked off the pitch was that some brilliant goalkeeping from Anthony Patterson prevented Sheffield United from taking the lead.

But in the 25th minute, the Blades went ahead when Gustavo Hamer poached the ball from a wayward Sunderland corner, scampered upfield and found Campbell who chipped the ball into the net.

With the chance to play in the Premier League the prize on offer, the celebrations after every goal were fraught with emotion and, in this instance, Campbell was buried under a pile of Sheffield United players.

Just 10 minutes later the Blades thought they’d doubled their lead when Harrison Burrows found the back of the net after Sunderland’s defense cleared a corner only as far as the edge of the box. However, the goal was disallowed after a Video Assistant Referee check determined Vini Souza was in an offside position.

And the Blades were left to rue that miss opportunity, as well as another in the 69th minute when Patterson once again stopped a near-certain goal.

The momentum was beginning to turn and seven minutes later Sunderland strung a series of passes together that scythed through the Sheffield United midfield, allowing Mayenda to find the back of the net.

O’Nien, his arm in a sling, joined his teammates in celebrating, later telling Sky Sports he “covered more distance” celebrating his team’s two goals than he did playing.

The Black Cats kept pressing and, in the 95th minute, they had their reward when Watson pounced on a loose pass and sent the ball into the net for the late winner, ensuring that Sunderland became the first team in 29 years to win a Championship play-off final after trailing at halftime.

Napoli sealed its fourth ever Serie A title in thrilling fashion on Friday, defeating Cagliari 2-0 to pip rival Inter Milan to the Scudetto by just one point.

Goals from Scott McTominay and Romelu Lukaku either side of halftime propelled Napoli to the win, prompting the city to empty out onto the streets, the night air filling with fireworks, thick red smoke, glowing sparklers, flags, cheers and dancing, euphoric fans.

Going into its final game, Napoli held a one-point lead over Inter Milan at the top of the table. The title was within its grasp but there was no room to slip up – only a win would guarantee the club the Scudetto.

Across the country, in Lombardy, Inter took an early lead against Como through Stefan de Vrij’s header. Despite enjoying all the early chances against Cagliari, Napoli briefly fell behind in the title race. The tension inside the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium – named for Napoli’s greatest ever player – ratcheted up a notch.

This season, McTominay has emerged as a new, unlikely folk hero at Napoli. Surpassing all expectations of him when he joined over the summer from Manchester United, the Scottish midfielder has dragged Napoli to the title and was named the league’s MVP for his efforts.

So, it was fitting that McTominay gave Napoli the lead just before halftime on Friday with a brilliant scissor kick from Matteo Politano’s cross. That goal ensured he finished the league campaign with 18 goal contributions, the most from any midfielder in their debut Serie A season, per Sky Sports.

The people of Naples have embraced McTominay as one of their own, giving him the nickname “McFratm,” which loosely translates as “McBro.”

Then, five minutes after halftime, Lukaku found himself on the receiving end of a long, speculative kick downfield, weaved his way past two Cagliari defenders and slotted the ball into the net for a spectacular individual effort.

Napoli held on for the win and fireworks began exploding in the city around the stadium as soon as the final whistle was blown.

On the pitch, the players threw their manager Antonio Conte into the air. Since taking charge of the club last July, he has turned around its fortunes, taking it from a 10th place finish last season to its second title in three years.

In the process, Conte made history, becoming the first coach to win Serie A titles with three different teams, adding this one to sit alongside those he won with Juventus and Inter Milan as well as his Premier League title with Chelsea.

“When we got to the stadium, it was honestly difficult to get in, as I don’t know how many people were there,” Conte told reporters, per Reuters, before his press conference was interrupted by singing Napoli players.

“I had a slight thought, if we let these people down, it’d be something we carried with us for a long time.”

A new study may have uncovered exactly what makes orange cats special — though it might not be for the reason you think.

Ginger kitties are known among cat owners for being particularly friendly and feisty. To geneticists, however, the uniqueness of these house cats comes from the unusual way they get their color. Now, scientists say they have unraveled a longstanding mystery by identifying the specific DNA mutation responsible for that golden hue — and the variant has not been found in any other animal.

The genetic variant is described for the first time in a paper published May 15 in the journal Current Biology.

“This is a really unusual type of mutation,” said lead study author Christopher Kaelin, a senior scientist in genetics at Stanford University in California.

The vast majority of fully orange cats are male, which led scientists to reason decades ago that the genetic code for orange color is carried on the X chromosome. As with other mammals, female cats have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y. Any male cat carrying the orange trait on its one X chromosome will be entirely orange. A female would need to inherit the trait on both X chromosomes (one from each of her parents) to be completely orange, which makes it less likely. Instead, most female cats with orange fur have patchy patterns — calico or tortoiseshell — that may include black and white.

But where the mutation exists on the X chromosome, and how it gives rise to orange coloration, has been an enigma until now. Typically, mutations that lead to yellow or orange fur in animals (and red hair in humans) occur within genes that control for color. And those genes aren’t carried on the X chromosome. “That suggested to us that by identifying the molecular cause, we might learn something new and interesting, which turned out to be the case,” said senior study author Greg Barsh, a professor emeritus of genetics and pediatrics at Stanford.

The findings not only elucidated the peculiar origins of some cats’ charismatic coloration, but also revealed new insights about a familiar gene.

Genetic glitch behind orange cats

Step one was to identify genetic mutations that are unique to orange cats and might give rise to their color. For a decade, Kaelin has frequented cat shows, asking owners of ginger-colored cats if he could take samples of the animals’ DNA with a cheek swab. (He’s also interested in patterns that are similar to those found in wild cats such as leopards and ocelots, which are common in popular breeds like Bengal cats and Toygers.)

Comparing his collection of DNA with feline genomes that have been sequenced in the past five to 10 years, he and his research team found 51 genetic variations on the X chromosome that were shared by orange males. But 48 were also found in non-orange cats, which left three likely candidates for the elusive mutation.

One was a small, 5,076-base pair deletion that removed about 0.005% of the X chromosome in a region that didn’t appear to code for a particular protein. The deletion wasn’t located within a gene, where mutations usually are found. However, the mutation lay between two sites associated with a nearby gene called Arhgap36, which regulates an important hormone signaling pathway used by nearly all mammalian cells and tissues. There was no known connection to pigmentation. The gene isn’t even turned on in pigment-producing cells.

To find out how the gene affects color, Kaelin studied its actions in live tissues collected at spay and neuter clinics that otherwise would have been discarded. The experiments showed that, somehow, the deletion activates Arhgap36 in pigment cells, where it blocks production of black pigment so the cells produce orange instead.

The variant has not been found in other animals, including the wild cats that gave rise to domestic cats.

“It’s a genetic exception that was noticed over a hundred years ago,” Kaelin said in a news release by Stanford University. “It’s really that comparative genetic puzzle that motivated our interest in sex-linked orange.”

That singularity suggests the mutation probably occurred once during domestication and then was selectively bred for, Kaelin said. “We see the same mutation in all orange cats that we’ve looked at over a wide geographic area, so there’s a single mutation that occurred,” he said. “And we know that mutation is quite old because there are depictions of calico cats in Chinese art that dates to the 12th century.” He added that specialists in prehistoric DNA might be able to use the new findings to pinpoint when and where the mutation originally arose.

“The variants identified could serve as valuable tools in population genetics to trace domestic feline evolutionary history,” said Hannes Lohi, a professor of veterinary biosciences and genetics at the University of Helsinki in Finland. Lohi was not involved in the study.

In the meantime, Kaelin and his collaborators want to figure out how a small deletion that’s not itself within a gene can change the activity of a nearby gene.

“The goal is, sure, that we’ll learn about the mutation,” Barsh noted, “but we also want to learn more about mutational mechanisms in general: Why is this so unusual and might the same mechanism occur in other genes that cause other phenotypes in other animals?” He pointed out that there are many conditions in humans that are thought to be genetic, but for which no genetic mutation has been identified. Maybe, he posits, the problem isn’t just that we haven’t located the mutations, but that we don’t understand all the ways that mutations can cause disease traits in the first place.

And could orange cats’ unusual genetics possibly explain their particular personalities? So far, Kaelin says he and his colleagues have no reason to think so, though other researchers could make use of the new study’s findings to look for associations between behavior and coat color. “I think orange cats have really convinced their owners that they’re different, but they’ve yet to convince us,” he said.

(CNN) — Astronomers have for the first time spotted two galaxies in the throes of a deep-space “duel.”

Using combined observations from ground-based telescopes over nearly four years, the researchers saw the distant galactic neighbors charging toward each other at more than 1.1 million miles per hour (1.8 million kilometers per hour). One repeatedly wielded its intense beams of radiation at the other, dispersing gas clouds and weakening its opponent’s ability to form new stars.

“That’s why we call it a ‘cosmic joust,’” said Pasquier Noterdaeme, a researcher for the Paris Institute of Astrophysics and the French-Chilean Laboratory for Astronomy in Chile who was part of the team that made the discovery.

What Noterdaeme and his colleagues spied was a distant snapshot of the two galaxies in the process of merging into one large galaxy 11 billion light-years away. The findings, described in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, provide a rare look into earlier times in the universe, when star formation and galaxy mergers were more common.

Zooming in

Working with the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, the researchers found that the “attacking” galaxy’s piercing radiation comes from within its bright core, a quasar, powered by a supermassive black hole.

The intense gravitational influence of a black hole draws matter toward it in such an energetic way that dust and gas heat up to millions of degrees and become luminous, according to NASA. These luminous materials spiral around the black hole before entering, forming what’s called an “accretion disk,” and jets of energetic matter beam out away from the center.

Each blast of the quasar’s ultraviolet waves are about a thousand times stronger than the radiation of our Milky Way, causing hydrogen molecules from some of the “victim” galaxy’s star-forming nurseries to split and disperse, according to the study.

Stars form when large clumps of gas and dust reach a critical mass and collapse under their own gravity. However, researchers observed that after being dispersed by the radiation, the clouds were not dense or large enough to create new stars.

As additional material from the victim galaxy is drawn within reach of the supermassive black hole, it fuels the quasar with more energy. Quasars have been known to essentially “switch off” from time to time, said study coauthor Sergei Balashev, a researcher at the Ioffe Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, which could give molecular clouds the opportunity to reform.

“It’s really the first time that we can see the radiative effect of a quasar on the molecular gas of a nearby galaxy,” Balashev said. Until now, this effect had only been theorized but not confirmed through direct observation.

Scientists initially wanted to observe this particular quasar more closely because of its unique features among thousands of low-resolution spectra, which are like fingerprints for distant celestial objects, offering clues about composition, temperature and activity within them.

“It’s really (like) finding a needle in a haystack,” Balashev said. However, the light from quasars is so powerful that it often outshines their own host galaxies, making it difficult to observe other galaxies close by, according to Noterdaeme, the study’s co-lead author.

Highly dynamic, luminous quasars are rare, according to NASA. Only about 1,000 of these objects are known to exist in the early days of the universe, Anniek Gloudemans, a postdoctoral research fellow at the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab, previously told CNN via email.

“At first, we just knew there was some molecular gas between the (attacking galaxy’s) quasar and us. It’s only after, when we started to look with bigger telescopes, that we detected there were actually two galaxies,” Noterdaeme said.

An image taken by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) shows the molecular gas content of the two galaxies involved in the cosmic joust. ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO)/S. Balashev and P. Noterdaeme et al.

While the dueling pair appears to be overlapping in the low-resolution spectra, the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ALMA revealed the galaxies are actually separated by thousands of light-years. Using the Very Large Telescope, the researchers were able to study the density and distance of the gas affected by the quasar’s radiation.

Since the light from these objects came from billions of light-years away in the early universe, it’s possible the two galaxies have already merged by now, but there is no way to be sure, Balashev said.

A blast from the past

Scientists believe quasars and galaxy mergers used to be far more common earlier in the universe’s lifetime, said Dong-Woo Kim, an astrophysicist with the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was not involved in the research.

Galaxies merge when they are pulled toward each other by gravity, and the universe used to be more densely packed together. Over time, the universe has expanded, and more galaxies have combined into larger ones, Kim said.

Noterdaeme said that 10 billion years ago was an interesting time in the universe, adding that astronomers call this period when stars formed at a rapid rate the “noon of the universe.”

Though less frequent, galaxy mergers are still happening all the time, Kim said. Even our own Milky Way is expected to merge with the Andromeda galaxy in a few billion years, but the study team isn’t certain yet whether the “cosmic joust” phenomenon is a common feature when two galaxies collide and form a larger one.

“It’s an exciting field to study,” Kim said. “Research like this can teach us more about the birth of new galaxies and observe how they evolve over time.”

Billy Joel’s upcoming tour dates have been canceled as the legendary performer seeks treatment for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition that affects the brain, according to a statement released on said Friday.

The statement, posted on his Instagram page Friday, stated that Joel’s condition “has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision, and balance.”

“Under his doctor’s instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period,” the statement read. “Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health.”

The statement added that Joel “looks forward to the day when he can once again take the stage.”

CNN has reached out to Joel for further comment.

The singer was quoted in the statement, saying he was “sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience.”

Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus is a “very rare condition” that “occurs when a person has too much fluid in the brain,” according to Yale Medicine. Fewer than 3% of adults over the age of 65 are diagnosed with NPH and it affects men and women equally.

It was previously announced in March that Joel was postponing eight tour dates so that he could focus on recovering from recent surgery. A statement posted to his Instagram page at the time that he was set to “undergo physical therapy under the supervision of his doctors.”

“While I regret postponing any shows, my health must come first. I look forward to getting back on stage and sharing the joy of live music with our amazing fans,” Joel wrote, adding that he was “expected to make a full recovery” from the undisclosed medical condition.

The “Piano Man” singer on Friday announced that he was canceling 17 dates total, including the eight rescheduled shows.

Joel’s statement notified ticket holders that they will be automatically refunded the cost of their tickets.

Consumers aren’t ready to ditch their travel plans despite growing economic gloom. But they are hunting for bargains — and hoping to find them on the open road.

Some 53% of U.S. consumers are planning vacations this season, up from 48% a year ago, Deloitte researchers reported Tuesday. There’s especially strong interest in brief but more frequent trips closer to home, including by car, as travelers take a “more frugal approach” this year, the analysts said.

Chris Narvaez, 45, had planned to visit London and Rome this summer. Airfares to Europe are down 8%, according to travel booking platform Hopper, but the New York City-based human resources director said he’s “hitting the pause button” on overseas travel.

“Between new requirements for visas, the current administration, challenges with air traffic control and near misses at local airports, I don’t feel as comfortable as I would getting on a plane,” he said, referring to updated ID and entry rules along with increased customs stops. Instead, he’ll stick to the East Coast — with jaunts to Woodstock, New York; Washington, D.C.; and Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts — piling into the car with friends and his 15-year-old shepherd mix, Eli.

Alexisa Humphrey, owner of Sugar and Spice Travels in Lebanon, Tennessee, said her customers are still venturing out. But like Narvaez, “they are doing shorter, more budget-friendly trips,” she said, citing some of the same travel concerns. “I have had clients cancel flights and drive or book a train instead.”

Highway driving remains far more dangerous than commercial air travel or passenger rail, federal data shows. But recent air traffic control issues at Newark Liberty International Airport have spooked many travelers, Humphrey said. Travel volumes at the busy New Jersey airport are down 20% from this time last year, NBC News reported Tuesday.

Cost is also a factor. While round-trip domestic flights are hitting three-year lows, according to Hopper, driving typically remains much more affordable. Gas is about 40 cents cheaper heading into Memorial Day than a year ago, according to AAA, which expects a record 45.1 million people to travel at least 50 miles from home over the long holiday weekend. That would mark a more than 3% jump since 2024 to hit the highest level in 20 years.

U.S. consumers have been trimming their vacation budgets as price-hike headlines proliferate and economic sentiment tumbles to historic lows. Travelers told Deloitte in March that they were planning to spend an average of $3,987 on their main summertime trips, about 13% more than a year earlier. Just two weeks later, though — as frenzied tariff news rattled stock markets — that estimate shrunk to $3,471, less than 1% more than in 2024.

Latisha Hunt, a real estate agent and Air Force veteran in Biloxi, Mississippi, is one of Humphrey’s clients who recently adjusted her summer plans. She shortened a trip to Panama in early July from seven days to three and will drive 5½ hours to Atlanta’s airport rather than fly out of a smaller one closer to home.

“It’s more affordable and allows me to better manage my overall experience,” said Hunt, 39, who’s also planning car trips in coming months to Alabama, Tennessee, Ohio and Michigan. “I’ll be staying with family and friends along the way, which helps keep costs low and adds a more personal, meaningful touch to each visit.”

Hunt will have plenty of company on the roads. Among drivers surveyed at the pump by gas station video network GSTV this winter, 56% said they planned to drive more on their summer vacations than they did last year; 54% reported choosing driving over flying to save money.

Many summer road trippers are on tighter budgets. Bank of America researchers found driving to be the top mode of transport for lower- and middle-income vacationers this summer — preferred by at least 64% of each group, compared with less than 55% of high-earners.

The good news is that rental car costs were down about 2.1% in April from the year before, according to federal data, and Hopper expects them to stay roughly flat with 2024 levels throughout the summer. But as major rental car operators have adjusted to slower demand, some — including Avis Budget Group and Hertz — are slashing their fleets, which could reduce vehicle selection.

Car travelers may also need to budget extra for parking at airports and hotels, many of which tack on fees that can range from just a few dollars to $80 a day. Driver-friendly hotels along major highways and outside of urban areas frequently offer free daily parking, but overnight rates can still top $100 per night at high-demand lots.

In fact, road trippers are a fast-growing slice of accommodation operators’ business. Hotel parking revenues surged 18% between 2019 and 2024, according to real estate and investment firm CBRE. Hotel revenue overall grew less than 7% over the same period.

“This should not be interpreted as more people driving to hotels,” said Robert Mandelbaum, hotel research director at CBRE. “It is a combination of hotels charging more for parking and more hotels charging for parking that did not before Covid.”

Former President Joe Biden on Friday attended his grandson's high school graduation, marking his first public appearance since he announced last weekend that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

In photos posted on Instagram by former first lady Jill Biden and the former president’s daughter Ashley Biden, Joe Biden appeared alongside other family members to celebrate the high school graduation of Robert Hunter Biden II from the Salisbury School in Salisbury, Connecticut.

One of the photos posted by Jill Biden included the caption, “Proud Nana and Pop! Congratulations Hunter — we are so proud of you.”

In photos Ashley Biden posted later Friday, it appeared that the former president was also spotted at the airport, though it is unclear which airport that was.

Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, with his personal office saying in a statement, “Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms. On Friday he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.”

On Tuesday, his office released a second statement, adding that he had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer prior to last week. The statement also clarified that the former president had not been tested for prostate cancer in over a decade.

Biden’s cancer diagnosis reignited debate among Democrats over the former president’s age and health, particularly as his diagnosis was announced close to the release of a new book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson that examined Biden’s health and cognitive abilities during the 2024 presidential campaign.

Biden and his family have repeatedly defended the former president from allegations that his cognitive or physical health was deteriorating while he was in office.

His granddaughter Naomi Biden wrote in a post on X this week that the book was “a bunch of unoriginal, uninspired lies written by irresponsible self promoting journalists out to make a quick buck.”

The book “relies on unnamed, anonymous sources pushing a self-serving false narrative that absolves them of any responsibility for our current national nightmare,” she added. “All of this at the expense of a man so completely good and honest that it is impossible for these people to ever understand the why or how of it all. There are real stories to be told and one day they will be. I suspect history will reward the truth.”

Mexican singer Julión Álvarez announced the postponement of his Saturday concert at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, saying his work visa had been revoked.

Álvarez, show promoter CMN and management company Copar Music said the show had been canceled “due to unforeseen circumstances” and that Álvarez was “unable to enter the United States in time for the event.”

The 42-year-old musician further explained the postponement to his fans on Instagram Friday, saying in a video that they were formally notified on May 23 that the work visas for Álvarez and his bandmates were canceled ahead of the May 24 concert.

“Visa records are confidential under U.S. law; therefore, we cannot comment on individual cases,” a State Department spokesperson told NBC News when asked for comment.

Nearly 50,000 tickets were sold for Saturday’s show, according to the artist’s statement. Promoters and Álvarez’s team said they are actively working to reschedule the performance and all previously purchased tickets will be eligible for the new date.

If patrons cannot attend the new date, details will be provided for requesting a refund, the statement said.

Saturday’s performance would have been Álvarez’s fourth U.S. show on the “4218 Tour USA 2025,” following three shows in April at SoFi Stadium in California.

The regional Mexican music performer reportedly had run ins with the U.S. government before due to accusations of money laundering in 2017 in connection with Mexican drug kingpin Raul Flores Hernandez.

Álvarez, known as “The King of the Box Office,” was blacklisted by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control that year but later removed in May 2022.

Álvarez’s team did not immediately respond to an NBC News request for comment. Álvarez has previously categorically denied having any ties to Hernandez.

Billy Joel canceled his upcoming concerts following a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus.

The announcement was made Friday in a statement shared across his social media accounts.

The statement said the condition has been "exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance," the statement read.

The "Piano Man" singer, 76, is currently receiving treatment.

"Under his doctor’s instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period," the statement said. "Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health."

Normal pressure hydrocephalus, or NPH, is caused when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside a person’s skull and presses on the brain, according to the Cleveland Clinic. It mostly occurs in people over the age of 65.

That fluid tends to take up a little more space in older adults because brain volume shrinks as a normal part of the aging process, said Dr. Wajd Al-Holou, a neurosurgeon at the University of Michigan Health.

Memory loss, incontinence and trouble walking are also common. Patients can have trouble lifting their feet, putting them at risk for stumbling and falling.

While the disorder can look like dementia, a key difference is that NPH is often treatable and sometimes reversible if caught early, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Joel said in a statement that he was "sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding."

The list of canceled shows can be viewed here.

This is not the first time the "Uptown Girl" singer adjusted a tour due to health issues. In March, he announced that he would postpone a tour for four months because of a "medical condition." The condition was not specified.

In February, Joel fell during a performance in Uncasville, Connecticut. In a video posted to TikTok on Feb. 23, the musician appears to throw his microphone and microphone stand at the crowd after wrapping up a song before losing his balance and falling onto his side. Joel rolled onto his back and laid there for a second, before appearing to attempt to get up on his own.

The U.S. Justice Department said Friday that it has reached a deal with Boeing that will allow the aircraft maker to avoid prosecution over two crashes of its 737 Max planes that killed 346 people.

The non-prosecution agreement would allow Boeing, a major military contractor and top U.S. exporter, to avoid being labeled a felon. The decision means Boeing won’t face trial as scheduled next month, as crash victims’ family members have urged for years.

The Department of Justice met with crash victims’ family members last week to discuss the potential deal.

In a court filing Friday the DOJ said it “is the Government’s judgment that the Agreement is a fair and just resolution that serves the public interest.”

The agreement “guarantees further accountability and substantial benefits from Boeing immediately, while avoiding the uncertainty and litigation risk presented by proceeding to trial.”

The DOJ said it intends to file a motion to dismiss the case once the “agreement in principle” is finalized, by no later than the end of next week.

Under the agreement, Boeing will have to “pay or invest” more than $1.1 billion, the DOJ said in its filing in federal court in Texas on Friday. That amount includes a $487.2 million criminal fine, though $243.6 million it already paid in an earlier agreement would be credited. It also includes $444.5 million for a new fund for crash victims, and $445 million more on compliance, safety and quality programs.

Boeing declined to comment.

The company has been trying for years to put the two crashes of its best-selling Max planes — a Lion Air flight in October 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines flight less than five months later — behind it. The Maxes were grounded worldwide for nearly two years after the second crash, a pause that gave rival Airbus a head start in recovering from the Covid pandemic.

But families of the crash victims have criticized previous agreements as sweetheart deals for Boeing, called for more accountability from the company and said its executives should stand trial. In 2022, a former chief technical pilot for Boeing was acquitted on fraud charges tied to the Max’s development.

Several of the victims’ family members issued a statement through their lawyer shortly after the court filing was released criticizing the deal and saying it set a troubling precedent for other large companies.

“This kind of non-prosecution deal is unprecedented and obviously wrong for the deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history. My families will object and hope to convince the court to reject it,” said the families’ lawyer, Paul Cassell.

The Justice Department said relatives of more than 110 crash victims told the government they support the non-prosecution agreement or “support the Department’s efforts to resolve the case pre-trial more generally,” but added that others said they want the U.S. to take Boeing to trial and that they would litigate to dismiss the deal.

The aerospace giant reached a settlement in 2021 in the final days of the first Trump administration that shielded it from prosecution for three years.

Under that deal, Boeing agreed to pay a $2.51 billion fine to avoid prosecution. That included a $243.6 million criminal penalty, a $500 million fund for crash victims’ family members and $1.77 billion for its airline customers. The new fund will be on top of the $500 million that was already established.

That 2021 settlement was set to expire two days after a door panel blew out of a nearly new 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Airlines on Jan. 5, 2024, after the aircraft left Boeing’s factory without key bolts installed.

But last year, U.S. prosecutors said Boeing violated the 2021 settlement, accusing the company of failing to set up and enforce a compliance and ethics program to detect violations of U.S. fraud laws.

Last July, toward the end of the Biden administration, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to the criminal fraud charge in a new settlement. A federal judge later rejected the plea deal, citing concerns with diversity, equity and inclusion requirements for choosing a corporate monitor.

Under that 2024 deal, Boeing would have faced a fine of up to $487.2 million, though the Justice Department recommended that the court credit Boeing with half that amount it paid under the previous agreement.

The U.S. had accused Boeing of conspiracy to defraud the government by misleading regulators about its inclusion of a flight-control system on the Max that was later implicated in the two crashes.

“Boeing’s employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception,” then-acting Assistant Attorney General David Burns of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division said at the time of the 2021 deferred prosecution agreement.

Messages revealed in an investigation into the Max’s development showed the former top Boeing pilot who was found not guilty of fraud in 2022, Mark Forkner, told the FAA to delete the flight-control system known as MCAS from manuals and, in a separate email, he boasted about “jedi-mind tricking” regulators into approving the training material.

Lawyers for victims’ family members railed against last year’s preliminary plea deal, equating it to a slap on the wrist for the corporate giant, which recently won a contract worth billions to build the next-generation fighter jet and works on other military programs including outfitting two new presidential jets.

PARIS — Eight people were convicted Friday of crimes connected to the 2016 hotel robbery of Kim Kardashian, who lost millions of dollars in jewels during the terrifying heist.

One of the 10 defendants was fully acquitted on charges of planning and carrying out the armed robbery during Paris Fashion Week in 2016, while another was convicted on a weapons charge that arose from the Kardashian probe — but wasn’t directly tied to the original crime.

Defendants were cleared of kidnapping allegations but three were convicted of a lesser, similar charge of sequestration with no voluntary liberation as Kardashian was bound at the scene but let there to be found safely.

Years of French bureaucracy delayed the trial by almost a decade, despite the defendants being arrested just months later after police found DNA at the scene.

The three judges and six jurors delivered their verdict shortly after 8 p.m. local time, or 2 p.m. ET. The panel of nine had to reach a super majority of seven for a charge to be adjudicated.

All of those convicted can avoid prison time if they remain out of any kind of criminal legal jeopardy in coming years, according to sentences handed down with the verdicts on Friday night.

The defendants had previously served varying amounts of pre-trial detention, some as long as two years. But they were all free on Friday night.

“I am deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice in this case," Kardashian said in a statement following the findings of guilt.

"The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family. While I’ll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all. I remain committed to advocating for justice, and promoting a fair legal system.”

Most of the defendants are in their 60s and 70s, arriving at court wearing orthopedic shoes and wielding canes. Some have illnesses that include cancer and Parkinson's disease and could not have contrasted more with Kardashian, 44, the billionaire influencer and business doyenne whose testimony marked a moment of high drama.

“I absolutely did think I was going to die,” she told the court last week. “I have babies. I have to make it home. They can take everything. I just have to make it home."

That was in the early hours of Oct. 3, 2016, when two of the men allegedly broke into her high-end private apartment, binding her ankles while she wore just a bathrobe.

With one pointing a gun at her, they stole $9 million of her jewelry, including a 20-carat diamond ring gifted by her then-husband, Kanye West, now known as Ye, prosecutors said.

They escaped on bike and on foot, prosecutors say, only to be arrested months later. Aside from a large cross dropped during the escape, none of the jewels have been recovered.

Eight of the defendants proclaim their innocence. Two have admitted they played some role, though they say this has been overstated by the prosecution.

One of them, Yunice Abbas, now 72, wrote a book about it entitled “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian.”

In a final statement to the court Friday, Abbas said, “I have nothing but regrets to offer you and will take my responsibilities.”

Abbas was found guilty of conspiracy, theft with a weapon and holding the victim in sequestration without voluntary liberation. Abbas will not have to serve any prison time if he steers clear of any other crimes in the next four years, or else he could be put behind bars for 7 years.

Prosecutors say the mastermind was Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, an alleged veteran of the Paris underworld known as “Old Omar.” He admitted he was involved but claims he was only a foot soldier. He says the real leader was someone called “X” or “Ben” — who prosecutors assert does not exist.

Khedache was found guilty of theft with a weapon and holding the victim in sequestration without voluntary liberation.

If Khedache does not commit any crimes or other infractions in the next five years, he could avoid an 8-year term.

Didier Dubreucq was found guilty of conspiracy, theft with a weapon and holding the victim in sequestration without voluntary liberation. If Dubreucq stays out of trouble for the next 5 years, he could avoid a 7-year sentence.

Khedache’s son and alleged getaway driver, Harminy Ait Khedache, was found guilty of complicity in escape and using committing larceny with threat of a weapon. The getaway driver must stay clean for 4 years if he's to avoid a 5-year prison sentence.

While he was investigated for the Kardashian robbery, Florus Heroui was found in possession of a illegal weapon and was fined 5,000 euros. He was found not guilt of conspiracy and complicity in the escape

Gary Madar was cleared of conspiracy and complicity in the escape.

Khedache’s girlfriend Christiane Glotin was found guilty of conspiracy and could avoid 4 years in prison by staying our of trouble for these next 4 years.

Marc-Alexandre Boyer was convicted of larceny with use of a weapon, possession of an illegal weapon, participation in a criminal and conspiracy. He was told to steer clear of crime for 4 years to avoid 7 years in prison.

François Delaporte was found guilty of forgery and can remain out of prison by avoiding any other criminals acts over the next 3 years.

Khedache, who is deaf and mute and has a condition requiring him to go to the bathroom every hour, was among the defendants to give a note of apology to Kardashian while she took the stand.

“The past cannot be undone, but I hope that this letter will enable you to gradually forget the trauma you have experienced through my fault,” the letter said.

She responded, “I forgive you for what had taken place but it doesn’t change the emotions, the feeling and the trauma and the fact that my life has forever changed.”

A former Kansas police officer whom prosecutors declined to charge in the 2022 shooting death of a man with a known history of mental health crises was twice presented top “valor” awards by law enforcement groups for his actions during the fatal encounter.

The ceremonies stand in sharp contrast to the federal wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of Brandon Lynch, 27, a year ago.

One of the commendations, a “Gold Award for Uncommon Valor” presented by the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police on May 1, 2024, was handed out two days before the family filed its suit against the officer, Conner Thompson, and the city of Olathe.

In the complaint filed in the District of Kansas, Lynch’s family claims Thompson “unnecessarily escalated the situation” and applied an “unreasonable use of excessive force” that failed to consider proper crisis intervention training.

Details of the awards — the first of which was given to Thompson by the Kansas City Metropolitan Area Chiefs and Sheriffs Association in November 2023 — have not been previously reported. A detailed review of the awards shows that Thompson and his then-partner were honored for what police say occurred on the night Lynch was fatally shot, New Year’s Eve in 2022.

Specifically, the Metropolitan Area Chiefs and Sheriffs Association said the officers “responded to a disturbance” at a home where a woman called to say her brother had assaulted her. Once at the home, the officers told the woman to wait outside while they entered and were confronted by the man, who was armed with a knife and Taser, the group’s narrative of events said.

When the man “continued to be aggressive” and did not obey orders, Thompson’s partner attempted to use his department-issued Taser on him, but it was “ineffective,” the narrative said.

“The suspect defied Thompson’s commands and advanced towards both officers,” the narrative said. “Recognizing the suspect was in close proximity of the officers, Thompson fired his handgun at the suspect, striking him.”

“During a tense situation, Thompson had the wherewithal to conduct life-saving measures,” the narrative added.

The version of events offered by the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police was similar.

Neither narrative mentioned Lynch by name nor explained that a dispatcher had relayed to officers that Lynch was exhibiting a mental health crisis, as his sister had explained when she called 911. Nor did the narratives note that officers had had prior encounters with him at the home, including one time in which Thompson was in a “physical altercation” with Lynch, according to the Johnson County prosecutors who investigated the shooting and determined “the officer properly used deadly force in this incident.”

A review of the “valor” awards given to other officers by the Metropolitan Area Chiefs and Sheriffs Association that year show they were for actions such as saving suicidal people, helping a gunshot victim and assisting an infant who stopped breathing because of a respiratory virus.

The law firm for Lynch’s family, Cannezzaro Marvel LLC in Kansas City, Missouri, declined to comment about the suit or the officer being awarded for his actions on the night Lynch died.

The president of the Metropolitan Area Chiefs and Sheriffs Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dennis Shaw, the executive director of the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police, said in an email that “the officer was cleared by the District Attorney,” and the narrative the association shared “was presented to us for consideration.”

While the honor given to Thompson stood out in the awards ceremony, it’s not unheard of for officers to receive commendations related to fatal shooting incidents.

Narene Stokes, whose son, Ryan, was fatally shot by Kansas City, Missouri, police in 2013, recalled feeling “baffled, angry and confused” when she learned the officers involved in his death were recognized with awards by a local police board for their actions. The award, however, was later rescinded.

“The officers want to say they feared for their life — and that’s why they get an award?” Stokes said.

In Lynch’s case, police bodycam video was made public when Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe announced that his office would not be charging the officer. “Lynch took the actions that caused his death,” he said in May 2023, and “the officers reacted to the aggressiveness of Lynch throughout that episode.”

Texas is poised to become the second state to enact an across-the-board ban on social media for minors before its state legislative session ends in a little over a week.

Advocates on both sides of the issue have said the bill would be the strictest state-level regulation yet on social media platforms if enacted. And it comes as other states across the country are considering similar restrictions amid fierce debates over free speech and whether these sorts of policies are the most effective way to achieve supporters' primary goal: improving young Americans' mental health.

If enacted, Texas' bill would put in place vast new restrictions that explicitly bar every Texas resident under 18 years old from signing up for and using “a social media platform.”

The legislation would require all social media platforms to verify the age of all people setting up an account. It would allow parents to request that the platforms delete their child’s social media account — and require the companies to do so as well within 10 days. Violations are defined in the bill as “deceptive trade practices,” meaning that they would be both punishable with fines from the state’s attorney general and subject to lawsuits for financial damages.

The Texas House has passed the bill and the state Senate is expected to as well. Andrew Mahaleris, a spokesperson for Gov. Gregg Abbott, a Republican, said that “safety and online privacy for Texas children remain a priority” for Abbott and that he would “thoughtfully review any legislation sent to his desk that seeks to accomplish these goals.”

Such laws have run into major legal challenges by groups contending that such restrictions amount to free speech violations. And even many high-profile supporters of social media restrictions for minors say that bans for young people may not be the ideal policy solution.

“Something needs to be done,” said Dr. Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology strategy and integration for the American Psychological Association (APA). “These are things that we know don’t fit with the adolescent brain — things like endless scroll and ‘like counts.’”

“But an age ban — that’s like delaying the age of driving but not having any driver's ed,” Prinstein added. “Why just delay the age and then send kids out for slaughter later?”

The APA has repeatedly urged legislators to be more aggressive in trying to protect adolescents’ mental health, but have advocated for policies more tailored than age restrictions.

A variety of states have recently plowed forward with social media bills centered around age. And all of them — including Texas' — have garnered bipartisan support.

Most prominently, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, last year signed a bill prohibiting children younger than 14 from joining social media platforms, becoming the first state to enact such a ban. The law also required that teenagers who are 14 or 15 years old have a parent’s consent before they join a platform.

Florida's ban was allowed to stand after a federal judge in March ruled against requests to block the law, though the legal fight against it continues.

The law reignited a battle among First Amendment and civil liberties advocates over whether such bans amount to restrictions on free speech.

“We see this as a First Amendment issue, and, as these bills have generally been written, a serious First Amendment problem, because they essentially cut off an entire universe of information, of conversation from [young] people,” said Vera Eidelman, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project.

Over the past two years, at least nine other states have enacted significant restrictions on the use of social media, including requiring parental consent or age verification. More broadly, lawmakers in 27 states have attempted this year to advance bills that in some way seek to address or regulate minors’ use of social media, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

For example, the Nebraska Legislature approved a bill last week that would require parental consent for anyone under 18 to open a social media account. State House lawmakers in Connecticut last week narrowly approved a bill that would require the same.

Minnesota lawmakers have debated several measures this year, including a tax on companies that mine data on the state's residents and proposed mental health warning labels for social media platforms.

And last year, lawmakers in Georgia, Tennessee and Louisiana passed bills requiring parental consent for anyone under 16 to open a social media account.

Many of these proposals have faced serious legal hurdles. And similar bills in previous years — including in states like Ohio, Arkansas and California — faced major legal challenges, with federal judges striking them down on the grounds of free speech violations.

In addition, a social media curfew in Utah that banned the use of platforms for minors between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. enacted in 2023 was scaled down and replaced with more lenient restrictions last year after the original law faced a barrage of lawsuits.

NetChoice, a tech trade group whose members include Meta, Google and X that is staunchly opposed to most social media regulations, has been involved in litigation in those three states and many others where lawmakers have passed legislation seeking to curb social media access to minors. And the group signaled it was poised to do so again with Texas’ bill if it passes.

Chris Marchese, NetChoice's director of litigation, called proposals like the one in Texas “censorship regimes masquerading as online safety laws”

Each bill, Marchese said in an email, “puts the First Amendment rights of all Americans at risk, online and offline.”

Social media companies have said they’ve made several changes to their platforms that help protect minors.

Since 2023, Meta (the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) started showing teens a notification when they spend 20 minutes on Facebook; added parental supervision tools allowing parents to schedule breaks from their teens from Facebook; launched a new teen-centric product on Instagram allowing parents to help limit the content their kids see on the platform; began hiding more results in Instagram’s search tool related to suicide, self-harm and eating disorders; and launched nighttime “nudges” that encourage teens to close the app when it’s late.

TikTok, over the last five years, has instituted a variety of age-restricted features for users under 18, including limits on direct messaging and livestreams — as well as by-default private account settings for users between 13 and 15. The platform also instituted in 2023 a 60-minute daily screen time limit for users under 18, and, two years earlier, restricted nighttime notifications for some teenagers. In addition, the platform offers parents certain controls over their kids’ usage, including screen time management and what kind of content they are able to see.

Spokespeople for Meta and TikTok declined to comment on bills limiting the use of social media platforms for young people. A spokesperson for X didn’t respond to questions.

The broader issue has also grabbed the attention of lawmakers in Washington, D.C. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, introduced earlier this year the Kids Off Social Media Act, which would ban social media platforms from allowing kids under 13 to create or maintain accounts. The bill, which would also require social media companies to delete the existing accounts of kids 13 and under, has seen little movement since being introduced in February.

Meanwhile, federal lawmakers, following the lead of state legislatures, have also turned their attention in recent months to the growing movement to restrict the use of cellphones by kids and teenagers in schools.

Last month, Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., introduced a bill that would deliver funding for school districts to explore putting in place such restrictions. That effort comes as an increasing number of states have enacted laws or considered bills to ban cellphones in schools.

‘I don’t get to see John’

On Wednesday, Barroso, 32, Jayqwan Hamilton, 37, and Robert DeMaio, 36, were sentenced to decades in prison for murdering Clary’s son, 33-year-old John Umberger, and 25-year-old Julio Ramirez in the spring of 2022.

The trio worked together to drug and rob Umberger, Ramirez and three others — who survived — after having met them outside popular city gay bars and nightclubs, according to prosecutors.

The defendants drugged the victims to the point of unconsciousness — using a concoction that included fentanyl — before they used their lifeless faces to unlock their cellphones through facial recognition technology. With access to the victims’ devices, the men drained thousands of dollars from their banking apps and used payment apps to buy food, shoes, alcohol and other items, prosecutors said.

All three defendants were convicted of Ramirez’s murder, while Hamilton and DeMaio were convicted of Umberger’s. All three had maintained their innocence.

Barroso’s mother and family members of the other men convicted of murder could not be reached for comment.

“There’s no doubt in my mind that Jacob Barroso’s mother loves him, his uncle loves him, his family loves him. And they showed up as much as I did during the trial,” Clary said. “And yet something happened, and he lost his way.”

“They still get to see each other,” she added. “I don’t get to see John.”

The last time Clary saw her son was three years ago, when she went to collect his body.

It’s that moment, she said, that fuels her endurance.

She spent the next three years relentlessly pressing the New York Police Department, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, the mayor’s office, the media and anyone who would listen, determined to ensure that her son’s case was not forgotten.

Clary traveled from her home in North Carolina to New York City time and time again, meeting with investigators and officials, attending arraignments for her son’s then-accused killers, virtually every pretrial hearing, the three-week trial and, finally, Wednesday’s sentencing.

“I really wanted to hate New York and see it as a city that took John away from me, from us,” she said. “And it’s been part of the healing process that has been this beautiful thing.”

While the investigation continues, it’s already clear that no one was able to stop the 10 inmates in Cell 6.

The men, ranging in age from 19 to 42, some wearing orange jail uniforms and others in long, white pants and T-shirts, each shimmied through the hole, some pausing to leave taunting messages on the wall. “To easy LOL,” one wrote.

They leapt off the loading dock and made it to a barbed-wire fence, which they scaled with blankets. Then they dashed across an interstate and slipped into the night.

It was about 1:30 a.m. Another seven hours passed before the regular morning head count revealed that the 10 men were missing from Pod 1-D.

By then, they were long gone.

Dawn Cook, a truck driver, was at the wheel of her rig that Friday morning when she got a call from someone at the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office telling her Corey Boyd, the man accused of killing her son last year, had broken out of jail.

“He said there’d been an escape,” Cook, 71, recalled. “He didn’t have any details.”

Around the same time, she also got an automated text from a jail messaging system notifying her that Boyd, who was charged with murder, was no longer in custody. If she needed help, it said, call 911.

The news made her more mad than scared.

On April 29, 2024, her son, “Mister” Brandon Fees, was on a porch in the Marigny neighborhood with his girlfriend when they saw a group of people breaking into cars, according to police. Fees, 38, confronted them. They argued, and one of the suspects shot Fees. Boyd then struck Fees with a car, authorities said.

Boyd, 19, who pleaded not guilty, had been in jail for nearly a year before he escaped, and the case was nowhere near going to trial. The killing was caught on surveillance footage, but it took four months for Boyd to be indicted, and since then the case has been slowed by postponements and arguments over the sharing of evidence.

The holdups infuriated her. “I’ve been angry for a year now,” Cook said. “There’s a lot more to this than this escape. This is just too much.”

Delays in criminal cases are a chronic problem in New Orleans — and many other areas of the country — due in large part to backlogs created when the pandemic shut down courts. The difficulties in New Orleans go even deeper. The jail has been under federal scrutiny for overcrowding, understaffing, defective technology and malfunctioning doors; a court-appointed monitor cited the jail last year for failing to separate inmates who were violent or at risk of escape and for leaving housing units unsupervised for hours at a time.

Hutson responded that the jail had improved in some areas, including training, and said she had about half of the staff members she would need to run the jail optimally.

At last count, more than half the 1,400 or so inmates at the Orleans Justice Center were charged with a violent crime, more than 200 of them charged with a homicide.

At 10:30 a.m. on May 16, after authorities knew for sure who was missing and had talked to their alleged victims, officials released word of the jailbreak to the public.

By that point, federal, state and local law enforcement had launched an enormous manhunt, tapping into the city’s network of cameras equipped with facial recognition software.

The escapees had scattered. A surveillance camera spotted Kendell Myles, 20 — charged in a carjacking that left a man seriously wounded — walking in the French Quarter just before 10 a.m. in a dark hoodie and jeans, according to local NBC affiliate WDSU. Police later found him hiding under a car in a hotel parking garage and arrested him after a short chase, officials said.

Robert Moody, 21, who is facing battery, weapons and drug charges, fled south, making it about 2 miles before authorities captured him with help from a Crimestoppers tip. Two more inmates were later caught farther afield, 8 to 10 miles northeast of the jail.

Then, on Tuesday, Cook got a call from the district attorney’s office telling her that Boyd, the man accused of killing her son, had been captured. She had mixed feelings: happy he was back in custody, but not much closer to justice.

“It’s going to take so long for them to do anything,” Cook said.

By the end of the week, half of the inmates remained at large.

They included the Mardi Gras killer, Derrick Groves, convicted of opening fire on a 2018 Fat Tuesday party, killing Jamar Robinson, 26, and Byron Jackson, 21. Groves and a co-defendant were first found guilty in 2019, but a new law requiring unanimous jury verdicts forced a 2023 retrial, which collapsed when a juror broke court rules by reading news accounts of the case. A second trial that year ended with a deadlocked jury. Finally, in October 2024, a new jury found them guilty.

Groves' escape galled Robinson’s relatives.

The family said in a statement that they heard about it from neighbors at 9 a.m. on May 16, before anyone in law enforcement reached out to them. “This breakdown in communication has only deepened our grief and added to the pain we are already enduring,” the family said.

As a precaution, the family temporarily left the city. The relatives accused Hutson, the sheriff, and her jail staff of allowing the escape to happen. “We say ‘allowed’ because these inmates were essentially handed a ‘Get Out of Jail Free’ card, as if this were a game,” the family said.

Prosecutors who tried Groves also left town with their families over the weekend, Orleans District Attorney Jason Williams said.

“Any family member who is scared or frustrated, they have every right to be because this should not have happened,” Williams said at a Monday news conference. “And if it happened at 1 a.m. they should have been notified at 1:30, because they were in harm’s way.”

As the search wore on, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry demanded an investigation by the state attorney general and answers on why some of the escapees’ criminal cases had dragged on for more than a year. He signed an executive order to track cases in Orleans and other “high crime areas,” saying some of the escapees had been kept in the jail for far too long.

“Had they gone to trial, had they been convicted, had they been sentenced, they would most likely not be in Orleans Parish jail, but in the custody of one of the state penitentiaries,” Landry, a Republican, said at a news conference.

Williams, who has said the delays aren’t the fault of the district attorney’s office, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The escape itself raised grave questions about jail operations. Among them: How were the inmates able to leave their cells in the middle of the night, force open the door to Cell 6, tear out the bathroom fixture and cut steel bars — and escape through the loading dock under the watch of security cameras — without anyone raising an alarm?

Jail protocols under the federal monitor require a deputy on each housing pod around the clock and a supervisor to perform regular checks, said Rafael C. Goyeneche III, president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission, a private organization that researches the New Orleans-area criminal justice system.

“That means someone should have gone onto that pod, looked in every cell and seen if everyone who was supposed to be in the cells were there,” Goyeneche said. “Obviously that didn’t happen.”

Goyeneche said the jail appears to have missed several opportunities — mandated security rounds, camera surveillance, door-lock monitoring, Friday-morning breakfast service — to notice the escape.

These questions fall to Hutson, a lawyer and former police monitor in Los Angeles and New Orleans who did not have experience as a jailer before she became the first Black female sheriff in Louisiana. Since the escape, she has faced criticism from Landry and local officials in her own party, including Williams and members of the city council.

Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson, who runs the jail, said the inmates had help from members of her staff. NBC News

Hutson, who temporarily suspended her re-election campaign this week and did not respond to a request for comment, has admitted to “procedural failures and missed notifications” and said that the escapees had help from her staff.

She said she suspended three employees without pay, and one civilian worker was arrested on charges he cut water from the cell’s pipes prior to the breakout. The worker, Sterling Williams, told investigators that one of the escapees, Antoine Massey, threatened to shank him if he did not turn the water off, court papers say. But Williams’ lawyer gave a different story, saying his client was asked by a deputy to help fix a clogged toilet in the cell — and was not part of any plan to help the inmates.

And on Friday, authorities arrested a current inmate, Trevon D. Williams, on charges related to the escape. It is not clear what role he allegedly played.

The men also had help after they broke out, according to police. Two women have been charged with giving two fugitives rides around New Orleans. Another allegedly got Boyd food while he was holed up in a house. A fourth gave escapee Jermaine Donald, who is charged with aggravated battery and remains on the run, money through Cash App, police said. And a fifth person was arrested Friday, accused of aiding the escapees.

As the New Orleans manhunt continued, a new one began about 70 miles north. Tra’Von Johnson, charged with murder in a deadly home invasion, escaped the Tangipahoa Parish Jail on Thursday afternoon after another inmate boosted him over a fence, authorities said.

The local sheriff’s office said it didn’t discover the breakout until five hours later, when someone called asking if the man was still in custody. This was the second time Johnson, 22, has escaped the jail in the past year.

More people have been accused of helping 10 jail inmates escape from a New Orleans center last week, including another inmate.

Police arrested two more women in connection with allegedly helping 10 inmates break out of Orleans Parish Jail last week, the third and fourth women arrested in connection with assisting the escape.

Connie Weeden, 59, and Casey Smith, 30, were arrested Thursday and each charged with one count of being an accessory after the fact for allegedly "assisting the fugitives" in the May 16 incident, according to police.

Louisiana State Police announced Weeden's arrest Thursday. The New Orleans Police Department announced Smith's arrest on Friday.

The women were booked in correction centers in the New Orleans Metropolitan area and it is unclear whether they retained lawyers.

Later Friday, authorities announced the arrest of two other people accused of assisting in the escape.

Emmitt Weber, 28, was taken into custody at a New Orleans home after he allegedly helped two of the inmates flee, the New Orleans Police Department said in a statement. He was arrested on suspicion of accessory after the fact of simple escape, the department said.

Trevon Williams, who was in custody at Orleans Parish Jail during the escape, was charged with principle to simple escape, the Louisiana Attorney General's office said in a statement.

Williams, 23, was rebooked with the additional charges, according to the prosecutor's office.

It wasn't immediately clear if they have lawyers to speak on their behalf.

So far, five of the escapees have been found and arrested while five remain "unaccounted for," police said.

Two other women, Cortnie Harris and Corvanntay Baptiste, were arrested and charged on Wednesday for allegedly being accessories after the fact in assisting the jailbreak.

The NOPD said in a statement on Friday that Smith worked with Harris and "admitted to her role in aiding the escapees’ transport." Police said Smith aided "at least two of the reported escapees as they were transported to multiple locations in the hours following their escape."

A maintenance worker, Sterling Williams, was arrested and charged on Tuesday for allegedly cutting a prison cell’s water supply so the inmates could remove a toilet and escape through a hole behind it.

Police said their investigation found that Weeden was in phone contact with one of the still-missing fugitives, Jermaine Donald, both before and after the escape.

"Furthermore, investigators determined that after the escape, Weeden provided cash to Donald via a cell phone app," police said.

The three women each face up to five years in prison if convicted.

Police said that officers from local, state and federal agencies "will continue to pursue every lead until the remaining fugitives are located," as the search for the missing men could stretch into its second week.

"Those who choose to assist or conceal these individuals are violating the law and will be held accountable," the police statement added.

Anyone with information about the fugitives’ whereabouts is urged to contact the FBI, Crimestoppers, or the Louisiana State Police. For information that leads to arrests, there are combined rewards of $20,000.

Severe weather may put a damper on Memorial Day weekend travel plans for millions across the South, Plains and Mississippi Valley.

Around 13 million people from Texas to Alabama on Saturday are in the risk area, including Memphis, Tennessee; Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado; Birmingham, Alabama; and Oklahoma City and Tulsa in Oklahoma. Very large hail and damaging wind are the primary expectation this weekend, though a tornado or two cannot be ruled out.

On Saturday, a cluster of thunderstorms was impacting parts of southeast Oklahoma, northeast Texas and Arkansas, where a Severe Thunderstorm Watch remains until 4 p.m. E.T. Storms in this region will be capable of producing 70 mph winds and up to 2-inch hail.

In Missouri, 1 to 3 inches of rainfall was reported as of 2 p.m., with some areas receiving over 5 inches.

Conditions have become more favorable for a few tornadoes Saturday afternoon, especially over central Oklahoma. Storms will linger into the overnight hours.

By Sunday, 15 million in the same vicinity are under the risk for severe weather. Memphis, Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Birmingham are included in that risk for very large hail, damaging wind gusts and a few tornadoes. The strongest storms are expected to target parts of the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma.

A Slight Risk for severe weather will remain over parts of Texas for Memorial Day, impacting nine million in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, and bringing the same risks as the preceding days.

This setup will also bring the risk for flash flooding to the region, with four million in parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas under Flood Alerts through Monday. Total rainfall accumulation will range from 4 to 6 inches with localized amounts ranging from 8 to 10 inches.

Memorial Day Forecast

Rainy weather will impact the heart of the country for the holiday on Monday, with spotty showers stretching from the Dakotas to the Gulf and Southeast. A severe storm or two is anticipated over parts of the Lone Star State.

As a result of the cloudy and wet weather, temperatures across the Plains and Mid-Atlantic on Monday will range from the 50s to 70s, about 10 to 20 degrees below average. A mix of sun and clouds will impact the Northeast, while the West stays sunny and mild.

A spike in travel was recorded by the Transportation Security Administration this weekend, with over three million travelers screened on Friday. Friday was the third busiest travel day of all time, according to the TSA.

Around three million people are expected to travel over this weekend, with airport authorities and airlines encouraging passengers to arrive to airports at least two hours in advance.

At the heart of the murder charge against Karen Read is the weapon prosecutors say she used to kill her boyfriend — her 2021 Lexus SUV.

Prosecutors spent much of the fifth week of the widely publicized retrial laying out the physical evidence that they say shows that Read drunkenly drove into Boston police officer John O’Keefe, 46, and left him for dead outside the home of a law enforcement colleague on Jan. 29, 2022.

Lead prosecutor Hank Brennan and Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally called a series of forensic specialists to bolster that theory.

The defense, which has rejected those allegations, focused much of its attention on a single expert who examined a key piece of evidence — vehicle data — and subjected that expert to hours of interrogation-like questioning as attorney Robert Alessi sought to dismantle the analyst’s contributions to the prosecution’s case.

“I’m trying to understand your statement,” an exasperated-sounding Alessi said at one point during cross-examination. “Isn’t it either you have a bachelor of science degree or you don’t?”

Read, who is charged with second-degree murder, motor vehicle manslaughter while driving under the influence and leaving the scene of a collision causing death, has remained chatty with reporters throughout the proceedings and said after court Wednesday that she feels “great” about the case so far.

She has maintained her innocence throughout her legal battle.

Her first trial ended with a hung jury last summer. Her defense team has said that she was framed by former and current law enforcement officers and others who were at the home where O’Keefe was found unresponsive early Jan. 29.

The defense has also said that the state trooper who led the investigation into O’Keefe’s death was biased and manipulated evidence. The trooper, who acknowledged sending unprofessional messages about Read but testified that his conduct did not affect the integrity of the investigation, was fired after an internal investigation found he violated agency rules.

In court earlier this week, experts offered a flurry of technical, sometimes highly complex details about the physical evidence linked to Read’s SUV: a strand of O’Keefe’s hair found on the Lexus’ rear quarter panel; bits of red plastic discovered on O’Keefe’s clothes that could have been from the SUV’s broken taillight.

The vehicle data examined by Shanon Burgess, a digital forensic analyst, is central to the prosecution’s case. Brennan has accused Read of reversing her Lexus into O’Keefe in a hit that left him dead, and Burgess’ analysis found that the SUV recorded a “backing event” outside the home where he was found unresponsive shortly after 6 a.m.

The defense spent hours grilling Burgess on everything from errors the expert acknowledged making in his analysis to the accuracy of his resume. At one point, the grueling back-and-forth prompted a startling admission from Burgess.

Even though his curriculum vitae and LinkedIn profile state that he has a bachelor’s degree in science from the University of Alabama, he has no more than an associate’s degree, Burgess testified. He began pursuing a bachelor’s in 2008, he said, but never completed the coursework.

When Alessi pressed Burgess to explain the misstatements, he attributed them to “errors” and “misinterpretations.”

“But you would agree those errors or misinterpretations have been in existence for some time?” the defense attorney responded.

“Yes,” Burgess said. “I’m being made aware of them now.”

At another point, Alessi pressed Burgess on what the defense lawyer described as a series of errors the expert made while analyzing three chips from Read’s SUV. In a document Burgess provided to the prosecution in October, Alessi said, the expert asserted that a previous analysis used in the case was incomplete because it did not capture all of the data from the chips.

In fact, Alessi said, it was Burgess who erred by making mistakes in his data conversion method. He confused megabits for megabytes, Alessi said, and gigabits for gigabytes. (Eight of the former equals one of the latter.)

“The entire foundation of your proposal was based on a fundamental misinterpretation of the difference between a computer bit and a computer byte, correct?” the defense lawyer said.

“No, not the entire thing,” Burgess responded.

“Well certainly a part of it was, correct?” Alessi said.

“Correct,” Burgess said.

“Since you wrote that, have you learned the difference between a bit and a byte?” the lawyer asked.

“I’ve always known the difference between a bit and a byte,” Burgess said.

Later, Alessi questioned Burgess about what he described as discrepancies between two reports he wrote in the case. The first, submitted in January of this year, sought to reconstruct the events of Jan. 29, 2022, using vehicle data. The second, submitted earlier this month — after Read’s retrial had already begun — was a supplemental report that sought to “clarify” parts of the initial document, Burgess said.

On the stand, Alessi asked him to explain one of those discrepancies in the supplemental report. On direct examination, Alessi said, Burgess told the prosecutor that he’d submitted the document on his own initiative in an effort to respond to a “misleading” claim that he later said came from a defense expert.

But the report itself stated the opposite, Alessi pointed out. In the document’s first line, which Alessi read in court, Burgess said he was submitting the additional analysis at the prosecutor’s request.

“Which is it?” Alessi asked.

“This is a holdover, so a copy and paste from my original report,” Burgess responded.

“Do you cut and paste important information from one report to the other without checking it for accuracy?” Alessi asked.

“I copy and paste certain portions,” Burgess said.

“You didn’t review it this time, though, did you?” Alessi said.

“No,” Burgess responded. “I didn’t think it was significant.”

Air Force veteran Ed Anderson can’t recall any time past puberty when he didn’t get razor bumps after shaving his face. His coarse facial hair would often cause painful inflammation and itchy bumps as it grew back.

Anderson, now 70, remembers requesting a shaving waiver when he entered the service in 1975, allowing him to bypass the military’s requirements for men to be clean-shaven. For him and other Black airmen, the waivers became a symbol of unity.

“It was seen as an identifier of solidarity with other Black GIs having that shaving waiver,” Anderson said.

The military as a whole began issuing these waivers in the 1970s, with the Navy taking the strongest approach in 1970 to allow the elective wearing of beards to address medical conditions. But the policies of the different branches have changed multiple times since then.

Now, a new U.S. Marine Corps grooming policy that affects people with curly or coarse hair is drawing ire from critics who say it targets Black men. The guidance, issued in March, states that a diagnosis of pseudofolliculitis barbae, or PFB, a skin condition more commonly known as razor bumps or ingrown hairs, could lead to a service member’s expulsion from the branch if the issue persists. The U.S. Air Force also updated its guidance on PFB earlier this year, saying shaving waivers will expire 90 days after an airman’s next annual health assessment. But the requirements for those who may still qualify for a waiver remain unclear.

The condition affects up to 60% of Black men, according to the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology, a far higher rate than for any other group.

Anderson said he sees the move as yet another example of “ongoing attacks” on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the federal government.

“It’s mostly soldiers of color who are impacted by this,” he said. “I don’t see this as a productive and effective means of retaining and recruiting troops.”

The latest policy change under Brig. Gen. David R. Everly marks a reversal from a 2022 policy that barred Marines from being kicked out of the service solely for the skin condition. In the last three years, service members were able to obtain temporary or permanent shaving waivers, or “no shave chits,” once it was determined that their PFB couldn’t be treated by topical medications.

Dermatologists around the country who treat people with the condition say the latest policy change seems to be unnecessary.

“This is so targeted and intentional,” said Chris Adigun, a board-certified dermatologist based in North Carolina.

PFB “can affect only the way hair follicles appear,” said Adigun, “and does not affect the body systemically in any way.”

Under the new guidance, which the message says will best position Marines for “warfighting capability,” service members with PFB are now required to undergo a medical evaluation within 90 days. If their condition does not improve within a year under a four-part treatment plan, they could be separated from the branch at the discretion of their commanding officer.

Critics, however, call it an outdated policy rooted in discrimination.

An active military dermatologist, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said the move has “nothing to do with readiness.”

“On its face it’s a racist policy, because this is a condition that impacts African Americans and other people of color predominantly just by the nature of hair growth on the face,” they said, adding that it also “creates a huge administrative burden on a patient.”

It remains unclear how many Marines would be affected by the policy as the branch said it does not track how many members have shaving exemptions for PFB. Black service members make up 18% of all active-duty Marines, according to data from the Marine Corps Gazette, a professional journal by members of the service. The branch itself does not keep racial demographic data on its members, a Marines spokesperson said.

Military leaders say the change returns service members to grooming standards that ensure “maximum war readiness,” according to the mandate.

“Our priority is to ensure the health and resilience of our Marines while maintaining our warfighting capability,” said Maj. Jacoby Getty, a spokesman for the Corps’ Manpower & Reserve Affairs, an office tasked with acquiring and retaining talent. “These updates ensure consistency in the management of medical conditions while reinforcing our commitment to returning Marines to full compliance whenever possible.”

Adigun noted the policy’s history as a point of contention dating back to the 1970s, which led to social uproar among Black service members who had long argued against its efficacy.

U.S. military leaders have long maintained that service members need to be clean-shaven, both to maintain a professional appearance and to ensure the proper fit of airtight gas masks, despite little evidence that links PFB or facial hair to poor gas mask fit.

A study published in the Journal of Military Medicine in 2021 found little evidence that short beards interfered with the seal of a gas mask. A study in 2018 found that pilots with beards more than a foot long were able to maintain an airtight seal on their masks in a simulated cabin depressurization test.

Medical experts say PFB is improved by not shaving at all or shaving with clippers that don’t give a close shave, which allows the hair to remain above the skin surface after it is cut. Another option is laser hair removal. But for many Marines, the military dermatologist said, this permanent option for what many see as a temporary job is not a viable choice.

An analysis published in the journal Military Medicine also found a link between shaving waivers and delays in promotion that disproportionately affects Black service members.

This latest Marine policy change comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in March ordered a militarywide review of physical fitness and grooming standards.

“We must remain vigilant in maintaining the standards that enable the men and women of our military to protect the American people and our homeland as the world’s most lethal and effective fighting force,” Hegseth said when announcing the order. The Department of Defense declined a request to comment on the latest guidelines.

But, according to South Carolina-based dermatologist Lauren Ploch, standards that require clean-shaven faces are “rooted in institutional racism” because they single out PFB for strict treatment. She questions why there are not similar rules for other skin conditions like cystic acne or dissecting cellulitis, which affects the scalp. There are regulations for treating these issues, but no specific policies that could lead to a service member’s expulsion.

“If one of these conditions is not a disqualifier, then PFB shouldn’t be either,” Ploch said.

Dara Spearman, a board-certified dermatologist based in Indiana, said the potential for dismissal under the policy is “dramatic.”

“Given the historic interactions between Black Americans and organizations with regard to grooming habits and requirements,” Spearman said, “it seems there may be other factors at play than whether a gas mask fits.”

Anderson, citing his years of service, said he believes he’s well within his rights to challenge things he disagrees with.

“I’ve always been a patriot,” Anderson said, “but being a patriot also makes one qualified to question what’s going on — not just to blindly accept and go along with everything.”

NEW YORK — An explosion on a boat carrying raw sewage that was docked on the Hudson River in New York City killed a longtime city employee Saturday, authorities said.

Another worker on the city-owned Hunts Point vessel was injured and taken to the hospital after the blast around 10:30 a.m. near the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant, according to city Fire Department Deputy Assistant Chief David Simms. A third worker refused medical treatment.

The cause of the explosion was under investigation, but New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in statement that criminal intent was not suspected. The men on the boat, which takes raw sewage from the city to be treated, were doing work involving a flame or sparks when the explosion occurred, the U.S. Coast Guard said on social media.

First responders found a 59-year-old man unconscious in the river, New York police said, and he was declared dead at the scene.

The man had been a longtime employee of the city’s Department of Environmental Protection. His name has not been released, but the mayor said he was “a devoted public servant who gave 33 years of service to the New York City, and our hearts go out to his family, friends, and colleagues during this painful time.”

The blast spread raw sewage over the deck of the boat, and firefighters and other first responders had to be decontaminated, Simms said. DEP said there did not appear to be any environmental impacts following the explosion.

A man was arrested Friday after being accused of kidnapping an Italian tourist and torturing him for weeks inside a Manhattan home in a bid to steal the alleged victim’s Bitcoin, according to officials, law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the investigation and a criminal complaint.

The victim was able to escape the home and run for help Friday morning, the law enforcement sources said. John Woeltz, 37, was taken into custody that same day and was arraigned Saturday on one count each of second-degree assault, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a firearm, court records show.

Law enforcement sources close to the investigation said Woeltz and the tourist, along with a third person, had been in business together for years. Police are still searching for the third business partner, who has not been publicly identified.

The sources said Woeltz and the other person have allegedly gotten violent with the victim in the past, but never to this extent. They described the relationship between the three as very complex, and said it appears the victim was often picked on by the two men.

An attorney for Woeltz declined to comment Saturday. A judge granted a request to hold Woeltz in custody during Saturday's arraignment. His next court date is Wednesday.

Italian man was allegedly held and tortured for 17 days

The tourist, a 28-year-old man visiting from Italy, met his alleged kidnapper on May 6, law enforcement sources said. That's when, they said, Woeltz took the younger man to a home he was renting in Nolita, a neighborhood in Manhattan.

According to a criminal complaint, Woeltz and an unidentified “unapprehended male” kidnapped the victim, took his electronics and passport, and tortured him until he managed to escape weeks later.

The pair tried to get the tourist to give them the password to his Bitcoin account so they could steal the electronic currency, and when he refused, they beat him, shocked him with electric wires and hit him in the head with a gun over the course of weeks, the complaint said.

Woeltz and the other man allegedly pointed a gun at the victim’s head multiple times, dangled him over the ledge of the top flight of stairs in the home and threatened to kill him if he did not reveal his password, according to the complaint, which also alleged the pair threatened to have his family killed.

The tourist also told officials that the men tied his wrists and bound him to prevent him from moving, according to the complaint.

Law enforcement sources added that the men urinated on the victim and put an Apple AirTag around his neck to ensure he did not escape.

Upon his escape, the 28-year-old ran into a traffic agent who called police to the home on Prince Street. He told the agent he had been taken and held against his will and that he was repeatedly assaulted during his captivity, police said.

The alleged victim was taken to a hospital in stable condition, police said. When he approached officers Friday, he was covered in cuts and bruises with marks on his wrists where he was bound, law enforcement sources said.

Evidence found at suspect’s Manhattan home

Law enforcement sources said Woeltz is a prominent crypto currency trader from Kentucky, estimated to be worth around $100 million. The victim has an estimated worth of $30 million, they said.

Woeltz had reportedly been renting out the Prince Street residence at a monthly rate of between $30,000 and $40,000, the sources said. An online listing for the home says it was last rented in March for $75,000.

Law enforcement sources said there were cases of alcohol throughout the six-story residence, as well as stripper poles in the basement.

Those sources said officers turned up multiple Polaroid pictures of the victim being tied up and tortured at the home. Investigators also reportedly recovered several torture items.

Inside the residence, investigators on Saturday found a gun, believed to be the same one used to torture the victim, law enforcement sources said.

Neighbor shocked by details of arrest

Jennifer Crawford lives across the street from where the events unfolded Friday morning and saw Woeltz being arrested.

“I watched, like, the SWAT guys get out of the truck with their shields and everything and enter the building, and they were just starting to rope off the area and everyone’s yelling. It looked like they were a little bit in a panic,” she told NBC News.

She said she was shocked when she started learning more of the allegations.

“I just stood and froze,” she said. “A lot does go on here in New York. You can imagine, I’ve seen a lot, but this is the most unusual thing I’ve seen in 30 years in this neighborhood. I mean, that’s just beyond what you can even describe or imagine.”

Crawford said she couldn’t imagine the motive of someone with so much wealth committing this type of crime.

“All that money in the world didn’t do anything, it’s not going to help him,” she said. “Just doesn’t make sense, you know?”

On Saturday, hundreds of people passed by the townhome in Manhattan, some whispering about the details of the case. A few even took selfies in front of the home by the iron fence wrapped in police tape.

Police officials and investigators were in and out of the house Saturday, several standing guard in the front and recommending to those passing by to Google the home address to learn more.

A Florida man who shot dolphins attracted to baited fishing lines cast from boats he operated was sentenced to 30 days in prison and one year of supervised release.

Zackery Brandon Barfield, 31, not only shot the bottlenose dolphins but also used poisoned bait after growing frustrated that they were eating from his charter fishing clients, according to prosecutors, who said the crimes happened in 2022 and 2023.

Prosecutors and federal law enforcement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Barfield shot at five dolphins, killing at least one, and used poisoned bait on dozens more during outings from Panama City.

“He knew the regulations protecting dolphins, yet he killed them anyway — once in front of children,” federal environmental prosecutor Adam Gustafson said Friday in a statement.

Barfield’s attorney in the case did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.

Barfield opened fire while two elementary school-aged children were on board and, separately, while more than a dozen fishermen were on board boats he operated, prosecutors said.

He used poisoned bait even more prodigiously, they said.

"Barfield fed an estimated 24–70 dolphins poison-laden baitfish on charter trips that he captained," NOAA Fisheries said in a separate statement Friday.

NOAA Fisheries said it launched an investigation into Barfield in 2023 after one of its law enforcement agents received a tip that he was killing dolphins.

In an agreement with federal lawyers in which he pleaded guilty to two counts of illegal taking of a marine mammal and one count of federally prohibited use of a pesticide, Barfield admitted the government's narrative of his crimes is true, court documents show.

The statement Friday from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida said Barfield was angered by dolphins dining on red snapper from his clients' fishing lines.

NOAA Fisheries quoted the defendant as telling law enforcement he was “frustrated with dolphins ‘stealing’ his catch,’” the agency stated.

"He began placing methomyl inside baitfish to poison the dolphins that surfaced near his boat," the U.S. Attorney's Office said.

The pesticide was used on about a half-dozen outings, NOAA Fisheries alleged.

"Barfield recognized methomyl’s toxicity and impact on the environment but continued to feed poisoned baitfish to the dolphins for months," the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.

Barfield used a 12-gauge Remington Wingmaster shotgun to shoot the animals, prosecutors said. The mammals are off-limits under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

The National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Law Enforcement seized the shotgun, which will be forfeited under the plea agreement, according to court documents.

Though Magistrate Judge Michael J. Frank sentenced Barfield to 30 days for each of three counts to which he pleaded guilty, he was ordered to serve time for each concurrently, or in a single, 30-day stretch, according to NOAA Fisheries.

He was also ordered to pay a $51,000 fine.

NEW YORK — The leader of an eastern European neo-Nazi group has been extradited to the United States from Moldova following his arrest last summer for allegedly instructing an undercover federal agent to dress as Santa Claus and hand out poisoned candy to Jewish children and racial minorities, prosecutors said.

Michail Chkhikvishvili, a 21-year-old from the republic of Georgia, was arraigned Friday before a federal judge in Brooklyn on multiple felonies, including soliciting hate crimes and acts of mass violence.

He pleaded not guilty through an attorney, Samuel Gregory, who requested his client receive a psychiatric evaluation and be placed on suicide watch while in custody. Gregory did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Prosecutors described Chkhikvishvili, who also goes by “Commander Butcher,” as the leader of the Maniac Murder Cult, an international extremist group that adheres to a “neo-Nazi accelerationist ideology and promotes violence and violent acts against racial minorities, the Jewish community and other groups it deems ‘undesirables.’”

They said the group’s violent solicitations — promoted through Telegram channels and outlined a manifesto called the “Hater’s Handbook” — appear to have inspired multiple real life killings, including a school shooting in Nashville, Tennessee, earlier this year that left a 16-year-old student dead.

Since 2022, Chkhikvishvili has traveled on multiple occasions to Brooklyn, where he bragged about beating up an elderly Jewish man and instructed others, primarily through text messages, to commit violent acts on behalf of the Maniac Murder Cult, according to court papers.

When he was approached by an undercover FBI agent in 2023, Chkhikvishvili recruited the official to a scheme that “involved an individual dressing up as Santa Claus and handing out candy laced with poison to racial minorities and children at Jewish schools in Brooklyn,” according to the Justice Department.

He later suggested narrowing the focus to “dead Jewish kids,” prosecutors said, after noting that “Jews are literally everywhere” in Brooklyn.

Describing his desire to carry out a mass casualty attack, Chkhikvishvili said he saw the United States as “big potential because accessibility to firearms,” adding that the undercover should consider targeting homeless people because the government wouldn’t care “even if they die,” according to court papers.

He was arrested last July in Moldova, where he was held until this week’s extradition.

In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the case was “a stark reminder of the kind of terrorism we face today: online networks plotting unspeakable acts of violence against children, families, and the Jewish community in pursuit of a depraved, extremist ideology.”

Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday for his revenge thriller "It Was Just an Accident," handing the festival's top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years.

Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film ("This Is Not a Film") made in his living room, and another ("Taxi") set in a car.

The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 at the festival held up Panahi's name to honor the director then under house arrest.

On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country.

"Let us join forces," said Panahi. "No one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing."

"Let's continue to hope," he concluded.

The win for "It Was Just an Accident" extend one of the most unprecedented streaks in movies: The indie distributor Neon has backed the last six Palme d'or winners. Neon, which acquired "It Was Just an Accident" for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for "Parasite," "Titane," "Triangle of Sadness," "Anatomy of a Fall" and "Anora."

All those films were Oscar contenders and two, "Parasite" and "Anora," won best picture.

Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes, and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.

"It Was Just an Accident" was inspired by Panahi's experience in jail. In it, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.

"The film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today," Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. "Art will always win. What is human will always win."

The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes.

Other winners at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival

The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier's Norwegian family drama "Sentimental Value," his lauded follow-up to "The Worst Person in the World." Some had expected "Sentimental Value" to win the Palme, but Trier — whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve — still took a major prize.

"We live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time," said Trier. "And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment."

Kleber Mendonça Filho's Brazilian political thriller "The Secret Agent" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for "The Secret Agent" showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, "That was our wish."

The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' "I'm Still Here" in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said the awards "show that our country's cinema is second to none."

The jury prize was split between two films: Óliver Laxe's desert road trip "Sirât " and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama "Sound of Falling." Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for "The Little Sister," Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama.

The Belgian brothers Jean-Luc and Pierre Dardennes, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, "Young Mothers." Cannes' award for best first film went to Hasan Hadi, for "The President's Cake," making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.

What else shaped Cannes this year

Saturday's ceremony brings to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.

Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. "Can you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn't ship that way," said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, "The Phoenician Scheme" at the festival.

That was one of the top American films in Cannes, along with Spike Lee's "Highest 2 Lowest," the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner "Mission: Impossible — Final Reckoning" and Ari Aster's "Eddington."

MONACO — Lando Norris beat the Monaco track record, his main Formula 1 rival and a local hero to take pole position on Saturday.

Perhaps most importantly, Norris made a breakthrough in his own struggles with F1 qualifying, which have hampered his championship chances against McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri.

“It’s been a long time coming,” said Norris, who hadn’t been on pole since the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.

“I don’t think I’ve ever doubted what I can do. Of course, I’ve got frustrated, I’ve been unhappy, because that’s normal,” Norris added. “If you don’t win, if you don’t get pole, you’re not going to be happy, especially when it’s where you should be, it’s what the objective is.”

Norris and Monaco local Charles Leclerc swapped the fastest times before Norris upped the pace again to take first by .109 of a second. Piastri was third.

Norris’ time of 1 minute, 9.954 seconds replaced a record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2019.

It comes as Norris tries to cut into Piastri’s 13-point standings lead and follows weeks of frustration in qualifying — sometimes from small mistakes, but also a dramatic crash in Saudi Arabia last month. Leclerc, who won the Monaco GP last year, was denied a fourth career pole at his home race.

Leclerc said Monaco’s slow and twisty layout allowed Ferrari to dodge some of the “compromises” it’s had to make with its setup at more varied tracks.

Defending champion Max Verstappen, the winner of the Emilia-Romagna GP last week, was fifth for Red Bull after predicting Monaco’s low-speed nature wouldn’t suit his car, but starts fourth because of a penalty for Lewis Hamilton.

Rule change makes for uncertain race

Qualifying has typically been more important at Monaco than anywhere else on the F1 calendar. It’s almost impossible to overtake on the narrow streets so grid position is vital.

It could be a little different this time because drivers will be required to change tires at least twice during the race.

“I don’t think anyone really knows what to expect,” Piastri said.

That rule change follows a dull race last year when an early red flag allowed all drivers to make their mandatory pit stop. The race finished with the top 10 all in the same order that they started the race.

Hamilton penalized and Mercedes frustrated

A radio mix-up cost seven-time world champion Hamilton, as he was dropped from fourth to seventh on the grid for getting in Verstappen’s way.

In the first part of qualifying, Hamilton was told by the Ferrari team that Verstappen was on a slower lap, when the Dutch driver was actually trying to set a competitive time.

Hamilton was obliged to make way for the faster car, but the miscommunication meant the British driver was in Verstappen’s way on the racing line, landing him a three-place grid penalty for impeding.

Until then, Hamilton’s fourth place seemed a strong recovery following a crash in practice which required a major rebuild of his Ferrari.

It was a session to forget for Mercedes as its cars caused two red flags.

George Russell is set to start 14th after his car broke down in the tunnel with a suspected electrical problem, causing a lengthy stoppage while it was pushed out of the way by a track marshal crew. His 18-year-old teammate Kimi Antonelli hit the wall and was 15th.

Haas rookie Oliver Bearman qualified 17th but dropped to the back of the grid because of a 10-place penalty imposed on Friday for overtaking under red flags when practice was stopped.

INDIANAPOLIS — Drive through the neighborhoods surrounding Indianapolis Motor Speedway and it looks like Christmas in May.

Checkered flags and "Welcome race fans" signs on every block. Neatly trimmed lawns decorated with cutout Indy cars, a mock Borg-Warner Trophy, even an inflatable version of the track's familiar golden, winged logo.

Yet the "Racing Capital of the World" is eagerly and happily sharing the Memorial Day weekend stage with the Indiana Pacers and the Indiana Fever, two teams straight from the Hoosier State's lifeblood of basketball.

The Pacers flags and Caitlin Clark jerseys are easy to see all over town, including Gasoline Alley a few steps from the speedway's famous Brickyard.

Pacers & Racers weekend is in high gear.

"This is an epic weekend, an incredible opportunity to put Indianapolis on the minds of virtually every major sports fan on the planet," said Chris Gahl, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Visit Indy. "Our initial research shows no other city in the U.S. has hosted this diverse level of major sporting events in such a short amount of time."

It may be an anomaly nationally, but Indianapolis is built to thrive in this sort of spotlight.

The city has hosted the Super Bowl, two NBA All-Star Games, multiple international and national championships and, of course, now the 109th running of the Indianapolis 500. And through every virtually twist — even an NCAA men's basketball tournament held entirely in and around Indy — the reviews have come back with races.

The lineup

On Saturday afternoon, Clark and the Fever host the defending WNBA champion New York Liberty in front of a sellout crowd early in a season with title hopes for a team boasting perhaps the biggest star in the league. An estimated 350,000 race fans are expected for Sunday's midday Indy 500 race, including the first sold-out grandstands since 2016. The weekend will be capped Sunday night when the Pacers host the New York Knicks for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals.

It's the fourth time an NBA game has converged with race day, and the Pacers lost each of the first three — to the Knicks in 1999, to the Pistons in 2004 and to the Heat in 2013. They went on to lose all three series, too.

The off-court, off-track stories such as the Team Penske cheating scandal, the WNBA investigation into alleged racial comments directed at Angel Reese after a Fever game and the call for international peace from Israeli-born, Russian-raised pole winner Robert Schwarzman have played into the buildup. Even the Oscar Mayer Wienermobiles came to town Friday.

In a state where the greatest athletic feats often have been defined by auto racing or basketball, this weekend seems like a fitting marriage even to locals. Just ask IndyCar team owner-driver Ed Carpenter, a longtime Pacers fan and the stepson of former speedway president and CEO Tony George.

"I think it celebrates the city, the people that live here and the fans that make the pilgrimage to the race," he said. "(Having the other events) just makes it that much more special."

Carpenter hopes to attend Sunday night's game — even if he wins the 500 — and now finds himself surrounded in Gasoline Alley by a growing legion of crossover fans

Six-time IndyCar Series champion Scott Dixon and three-time 500 winner Dario Franchitti attended Game 3 of the Indiana-Cleveland series. Former IndyCar driver and broadcaster James Hinchcliffe was there for Game 2 and the triumvirate of Kyle Kirkwood, Colton Herta and Marcus Ericsson went to Game 2 of the Indiana-Milwaukee series. Scott McLaughlin, a Knicks fans, has a wager on the series with Carpenter and may attend Sunday's game if he's not drinking the milk in victory lane.

"How'd that go?" fellow driver Alexander Rossi asked after the Pacers' thrilling Game 1 victory on Wednesday.

"Real bad, we lost the unloseable," McLaughlin said. "We had a good wager. I have to buy the equivalent -- if the Pacers win in six games -- if they win in seven, the bet is off, or I win -- I have to buy the equivalent up to 2500 bucks of his (coffee/java)."

Red carpet treatment

The red carpet isn't just being rolled out for the Pacers and the racers. Film director Spike Lee is expected to be in his familiar spot inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse while his old foil, Reggie Miller, calls the game for TNT. It's unclear how many big wigs from the race will make the 15-minute drive (in good traffic) to the arena for the game. Two tickets to each event would cost you nearly $4,000.

Kyle Larson, who is making his second attempt at a different kind of race day double — completing 500 miles at Indianapolis and 600 more in Charlotte's NASCAR nightcap — already has made that trip. He went to the Fever game Tuesday night.

"Outside the car, it's been crazier this year logistics-wise," Larson said. "Going to New York and having a full day of media there and then flying back here. Going to the Fever game was fun."

The interest and intrigue goes the other way, too.

Three years ago, Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton made his IndyCar debut in a two-seater with Mario Andretti. Last weekend, Fever coach Stephanie White, an Indiana native, returned to the track while Fever center Aliyah Boston, the 2023 WNBA Rookie of the Year, got her first glimpse at the historic and vast 2.5-mile oval.

"Being on the track and kind of seeing how fast all the cars go, and to meet Colton was pretty dope," Boston said. "The track is huge. Colton told us how many things could fit in the track and that's insane. You don't understand how big it is till you're there."

Bottom line

Gahl said hotels are virtually sold out in Central Indiana and everywhere from Lafayette to Bloomington, roughly one-hour drives from Indy; downtown, the average cost is about $550 per night with a three-night minimum and restaurant reservations are scarce. Local merchandisers are capitalizing, too, selling blue-and-gold shirts that read "Zoom Baby," a play off the late Bob "Slick" Leonard's radio calls of "Boom Baby" for Pacers' 3-pointers.

In the midst of so much going on in a 36-hour window, the Pacers, racers and the Fever are all following the same playbook: Ignore the distractions and celebrate this incredible weekend.

"You've got to enjoy the moment, let the excitement and pressure go, focus on the task at hand right in front of you," Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard said. "It should be exciting and fun."

Weeks after the city of Chicago and Jussie Smollett announced a settlement to resolve their yearslong legal battle over the actor's 2019 claim that he was the victim of a hate crime, Smollett took to social media to disclose the terms of the agreement.

Smollett said Friday he would donate $50,000 to the Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts charity as part of a deal to secure the case’s dismissal. Smollett said would be making an additional $10,000 donation to the Chicago Torture Justice Center.

NBC News reached out to Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts and the city of Chicago to confirm Smollett’s donations and details of the settlement, but did not immediately receive a response to a request for comment.

Chicago Torture Justice Center confirmed Smollett's donation in an Instagram post Friday.

The actor said his decision to settle the civil suit was “not the most difficult” to make and allowed him to support the communities “too often neglected by those in power.”

Smollett, who is Black and gay, first reported a hate crime committed against him in January 2019, alleging that two men confronted him with racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him.

However, police and city officials later said he orchestrated the hoax hate crime against himself. The city’s suit accused Smollett of submitting a false police report on Jan. 29, 2019, saying he knew his attackers and planned the attack, and it sought $130,000 in expenses spent on the police investigation.

Smollett countersued, denying that he orchestrated the attack.

Brothers Olabingo and Abimbola Osundairo, who worked on the “Empire” set, said they were paid by Smollett to stage the hate crime and testified against the actor during his trial.

Smollett was found guilty on five counts of felony disorderly conduct in December 2021, and sentenced to 150 days in jail and 30 months’ probation in March 2022, but the Illinois Supreme Court overturned the conviction in November 2024 over prosecutorial issues.

The state high court ruled that Smollett should have never been charged in the first place after entering a nonprosecution agreement with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office.

Smollett has maintained his innocence over the years. He ended his post thanking his supporters.

MINNEAPOLIS — Former Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo vividly remembers receiving a call around midnight from a community activist. The caller told him to watch a video spreading on social media of a white officer pinning a Black man to the ground, despite his fading pleas of "I can't breathe."

The dying man was George Floyd. The officer was Derek Chauvin. And Arradondo was the city's first Black police chief.

"It was absolutely gut-wrenching," Arradondo, 58, recalled in an interview ahead of the fifth anniversary of Floyd's murder.

What he saw conflicted with what his own people had told him about the deadly encounter, and he knew immediately it would mean changes for his department and city. But he acknowledged he didn't immediately foresee how deeply Floyd's death would reverberate in the U.S. and around the world.

"I served for 32 years," he said. "But there's no doubt May 25th, 2020, is a defining moment for me in my public service career."

The video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, pinning him to the pavement outside a convenience store where Floyd was accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Chauvin maintained the pressure for 9 1/2 minutes despite pleas from onlookers to stop, even after an off-duty firefighter tried to intervene and another officer said he couldn't find a pulse.

"Remnants of pain and anger"

Arradondo sat for the interview in a public library that was heavily damaged in the unrest that followed Floyd's death. It's on Lake Street, a major artery that saw some of the worst destruction, a street that he says still bears "remnants of the pain and anger of what occurred five years ago."

Just down the block, there's the empty shell of a police station that was torched during the riots. And within sight is a Target store and a Cub Foods supermarket that were looted. Storefronts remain boarded up. While some businesses were rebuilt, empty lots sit where others did not.

Arradondo still stands by his and Mayor Jacob Frey's decision to abandon the Third Precinct and let it burn. Protesters breached the building, and police — who were spread thin — didn't have the resources to hold it. So he ordered his officers to evacuate.

"During the most significant crisis we've ever experienced, arguably in the state, when it's life or death, I've got to go on the side of keeping people alive and safe," he said.

Police reform

Arradondo subsequently helped launch an overhaul of policing in the city despite a resistant police culture and a powerful officers union. He testified against Chauvin in his 2021 murder trial, a rare breach of the "blue wall" that traditionally protects officers from being held accountable for wrongdoing.

Five years on, Arradondo, who retired in 2022, said he believes law enforcement agencies nationwide have made progress on police accountability — albeit incremental progress — and that police chiefs and sheriffs now move faster to hold officers responsible for egregious misconduct.

Arradondo was promoted to chief in 2017, and his elevation was greeted with hope among local African Americans who affectionately called him "Rondo." But his department had a reputation for being too quick to use force and many were angry about police killing young Black men in Minnesota and beyond.

Arradondo said he wishes he had made more changes to the police department before Floyd was killed.

"I would have pushed harder and sooner at trying to dismantle some of the toxic culture that allowed that indifference to exist that evening, on May 25th, 2020," he said. "I certainly would have invested more time elevating the voices in our community that had been pleading with police departments for decades to listen to us and change."

Making amends

Arradondo just published a book, "Chief Rondo: Securing Justice for the Murder of George Floyd," that explores leadership, justice and race, the broader impacts of policing, and the challenges of working within a flawed system. He closes it with a letter dedicated to Floyd's daughter, Gianna.

"I never had an opportunity to meet Gianna, but I wanted her to know that, even though I was not out there that evening, at that intersection when her father was pleading for help, that I heard him, and I was going to do everything I could to bring him justice," he said.

He wanted to say the words that she has not heard from the four former officers who were convicted for their roles in George Floyd's death:

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your father being taken from you."

Four of the six Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa and four in Minnesota will shut down in a year, the Midwestern affiliate operating them said Friday, blaming a freeze in federal funds, budget cuts proposed in Congress and state restrictions on abortion.

The clinics closing in Iowa include the only Planned Parenthood facility in the state that provides abortion procedures, in Ames, home to Iowa State University. The others are in Cedar Rapids, Sioux City and the Des Moines suburb of Urbandale.

Two of the clinics being shut down by Planned Parenthood North Central States are in the Minneapolis area, in Apple Valley and Richfield. The others are in central Minnesota in Alexandria and Bemidji. Of the four, the Richfield clinic provides abortion procedures.

The Planned Parenthood affiliate said it would lay off 66 employees and ask 37 additional employees to move to different clinics. The organization also said it plans to keep investing in telemedicine services and sees 20,000 patients a year virtually. The affiliate serves five states — Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.

"We have been fighting to hold together an unsustainable infrastructure as the landscape shifts around us and an onslaught of attacks continues," Ruth Richardson, the affiliate's president and CEO, said in a statement.

Of the remaining 15 clinics operated by Planned Parenthood North Central States, six will provide abortion procedures — five of them in Minnesota, including three in the Minneapolis area. The other clinic is in Omaha, Nebraska.

The affiliate said that in April, President Donald Trump's administration froze $2.8 million in federal funds for Minnesota to provide birth control and other services, such as cervical cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases.

While federal funds can't be used for most abortions, abortion opponents have long argued that Planned Parenthood affiliates should not receive any taxpayer dollars, saying the money still indirectly underwrites abortion services.

Planned Parenthood North Central States also cited proposed cuts in Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low-income Americans, as well as a Trump administration proposal to eliminate funding for teenage pregnancy prevention programs.

In addition, Republican-led Iowa last year banned most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant, causing the number performed there to drop 60% in the first six months the law was in effect and dramatically increasing the number of patients traveling to Minnesota and Nebraska.

After the closings, Planned Parenthood North Central States will operate 10 brick-and-mortar clinics in Minnesota, two in Iowa, two in Nebraska, and one in South Dakota. It operates none in North Dakota, though its Moorhead, Minnesota, clinic is across the Red River from Fargo, North Dakota.

A Louisiana inmate whom authorities began searching for after receiving a public tip was recaptured on Friday, according to the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff's Office.

Tra’Von Johnson, 22, was found on Bennett Road in Amite City, just a few miles away from the Tangipahoa Parish Jail, which he escaped from on Thursday afternoon, the sheriff's office said in an update Friday evening. This was his second escape from the jail, according to the sheriff's office, which said he broke out of the facility "a year ago this month."

"TPSO wants to thank, first and foremost, the community for standing with us in this effort," the sheriff's office said, adding that Louisiana State Police made the arrest.

The sheriff's office shared a video of Johnson being taken back into custody and placed into a Louisiana State Police helicopter.

Prior to his escape, Johnson was awaiting trial in Tangipahoa Parish Jail for his alleged role in a 2022 Hammond-area home invasion where a man was killed and his child was injured, according to the sheriff’s office. He has since been charged with simple escape.

Johnson has been taken to Angola, Louisiana, since he was recaptured, where he will await trial, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office did not clarify whether Johnson will be held at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola.

Johnson and another inmate, Trevon Wallace, were able to escape the jail after an inmate in their dorm flooded a shower at around 4:15 p.m.

"During the clean-up, while several sections of exterior doors were open to push water out, an interior door was inadvertently opened less than a minute before the error was realized and it was closed again," the sheriff's office said. "In those few seconds, Johnson and Wallace ran out of all of the doors to the yard."

The sheriff's office released surveillance video of Wallace and Johnson running out to the yard before Wallace gives Johnson a boost over a perimeter fence. Wallace ran back to the jail building afterward, where he was intercepted by deputies who took him back to his cell.

The deputies did not report the incident with the door, or Wallace's interception, to superiors, and failed to do a proper head count after finding him, the sheriff's office said.

Just before 10 p.m., the sheriff’s office received a call from a member of the public who asked if Johnson was still in custody. The person did not identify themselves, Sheriff Gerald Sticker said at a news briefing Friday afternoon.

The realization of Johnson's escape prompted a lockdown at the jail and a search that lasted until around 3 a.m. Friday morning, according to Sticker. Johnson was eventually found Friday evening.

"At this time, it is not believed this was a planned escape, but rather, an opportunistic one that was compounded by a failure of jail staff to follow protocols put in place as preventative measures for escapes," the sheriff's office said. "However, the current investigation into this incident does include looking into the person who called the jail and the inmate who caused the flooding to begin with."

Wallace has since been charged with simple escape and principal to help someone escape, according to Sticker. Four members of the jail’s staff were placed on administrative leave, he said.

According to the sheriff's office, the jail "is only able to staff one individual tasked with monitoring 60 cameras all at once while also opening doors as requested by deputies in and around the pods and dorms." Sticker said the sheriff’s office has been working to address deficiencies at the jail, but it is “still a work in progress.”

CANNES, France — A major power outage struck southeastern France on Saturday morning, disrupting traffic and briefly halting events at the Cannes Film Festival as the prestigious event prepared to hand out its top prize.

Power was restored around 3 p.m., as music began blasting again from beachfront speakers. The end of the blackout was greeted with loud cheers from locals.

Earlier, about 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department lost electricity after a high-voltage line fell Saturday morning, electricity network operator RTE said on X. The outage came hours after a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes overnight had already weakened the grid.

Police have opened an investigation into possible arson.

“We are looking into the likelihood of a fire being started deliberately,” said a spokesperson for the French national gendarmerie.

Cannes Film Festival organizers confirmed the outage affected the early activities of Saturday and said the Palais des Festivals — the Croisette’s main venue — had switched to an independent power supply.

“All scheduled events and screenings, including the Closing Ceremony, will proceed as planned and under normal conditions,” the statement said. “At this stage, the cause of the outage has not yet been identified. Restoration efforts are underway.”

Traffic lights in parts of Cannes and the surrounding city of Antibes stopped working after 10 a.m., leading to traffic jams and confusion in city centers. Most shops along the Croisette remained closed, and local food kiosks were only accepting cash. Train service in Cannes was also disrupted.

Screenings at the Cineum, one of the festival’s satellite venues, were briefly suspended, the festival added.

It was a paws-itively magnificent performance.

Less Brad Pitt, more Brad Pit Bull, the 25th annual Palm Dog awards in Cannes rolled out the red carpet Friday for the four-legged stars to get their flowers alongside their human colleagues, who were in town for this year’s iteration of the film festival held in the French beach town.

Under the Plage du Festival tent, humans sipped their wine while their furry co-stars soaked up the attention at the award ceremony, a pun on Cannes’ famous Palme d’Or, awarded to the director of the year’s best feature film.

This year’s top dog was Panda, an Icelandic sheepdog who stole the show in “The Love That Remains,” by director Hlynur Palmason. Panda is Palmason’s dog in real life, but the victorious hound could hardly be accused of nepaw-tism after her central performance in the drama that explores a year in the life of a family following parental separation.

With Panda unable to attend in person, she was granted perhaps the ultimate privilege of stardom — a double named Lola, who received the award on the winner’s behalf and was pictured alongside children.

Palm Dog jury member Wendy Mitchell said Panda was chosen for the grand prize because of how central she is to the family’s life in the film, joining them on hikes, on car rides and at the mother’s art studio.

“There are so many great competitors this year, but this dog is at the heart of the film,” Mitchell told Reuters.

While the vagaries of being a film-famous canine meant that Panda couldn’t be there to accept her award in person, she had her people send in a recorded video of her “accepting” the prize — a shiny red bandana stitched with the words “Palm Dog 2025” in golden thread.

“The Love That Remains” producer Anton Mani Svansson explained Panda “doesn’t really know” about the prize, saying of the dog’s bandana that “I guess she will feel good when she has gotten this around her neck.”

Past winners of the prestigious prize include Messi, the border collie from Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall,” which in 2023 became the only movie to claim a Palm d’Or and Palm Dog double. In 2019, a pit bull named Brandy owned by Brad Pitt’s character in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” secured the gong.

But the Palm Dog wasn’t the only prize on offer to furry thespians.

Pipa, a Jack Russell, and the Podenco mix Lupita earned the Grand Jury Prize for their sandy adventures in “Sirat,” a movie that follows a father’s search for his missing daughter in the Moroccan desert. Director Oliver Laxe picked up the prize in person on behalf of the dogs.

Meanwhile, dachshund Hippo received a special “Mutt Moment” prize for his memorable scene in the movie “Pillion,” starring Alexander Skarsgard.

Palm Dog founder Toby Rose told Reuters that the dogs truly deserved the recognition alongside the regular stars.

“When the camera’s on them and they do whatever their role is, they stand out,” he said.

The European Union has pushed back against President Donald Trump’s latest suggestion that he will impose a 50% import tariff on all E.U. goods, warning that trans-Atlantic trade must be built on “respect, not threats.”

The rebuke came after Trump said in a Friday post on his Truth Social platform that trade negotiations with Brussels were “going nowhere” and suggested he would slap a 50% blanket duty on all European goods entering the U.S. starting June 1.

It was just the latest bellicose remark from Trump and came amid a broader souring of relations between the two global powers that has seen months of distrust and economic sparring.

The E.U., home to nearly 450 million people, is the world’s largest trading bloc and one of Washington’s top commercial partners. It exported more than $600 billion in goods to the U.S. last year while importing goods worth around $370 billion.

Trump’s latest broadside follows his April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement of a 39% tariff on European goods, an idea he later walked back before he changed course again Friday with an even tougher stance.

Stephen Moore, a former economic adviser to Trump, told the BBC that his former boss was expressing his frustration with the E.U.

“I think he was hoping that by now we would have the E.U. coming with some kind of deal on the table, and so far that hasn’t come,” he said, calling the 50% import tariffs a “shot at the bow.”

E.U. Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič said late Friday that “E.U.-U.S. trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats,” and that the bloc remains committed to securing “a deal that works for both,” following a call with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

While the E.U.’s response signals a willingness to negotiate, discord has deepened between the bloc and its longtime trans-Atlantic ally over a return to the combative stance Trump took during his first administration, when he flew in the face of decades of cooperation and cast the E.U. as an economic rival.

In 2018, Trump said “nobody treats us much worse than the European Union” and argued the bloc was designed to exploit the U.S. He repeated that claim this year, describing the E.U. as being “formed in order to screw the United States.”

While the ideological architects of Trump's first administration such as Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro have also gone on record criticizing the union, many in Trump’s current inner circle have shared those sentiments.

Vice President J.D. Vance lashed out in February at European leaders at a security conference in Munich over issues ranging from free speech to migration and defense, dealing a sucker punch to the European view of America as a steadfast cultural ally.

“The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe,” Vance said, “is the threat from within — the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.”

That came after Elon Musk — the world’s richest man, who also served as Trump’s close adviser earlier in his second term — threw his support behind Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has called for Germany to leave the E.U.

Underlying much of the second Trump administration’s animosity toward Europe has been security funding, most prominently over the war in Ukraine.

While the administration’s view of the war in Ukraine has since softened, Vance has repeatedly opposed sending military aid to Kyiv, saying in February that “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.”

And in a Signal conversation between senior administration officials leaked in March, the vice president initially resisted U.S. strikes in Yemen, arguing he didn’t want to “bail Europe out,” while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that Europe was treating America like a “sucker” by relying on it for defense.

While Šefčovič’s call for a “deal that works for both” reflects the E.U.’s characteristically restrained response to the Trump administration’s jabs, Europe has been bracing itself for months for the possibility of a more distant economic relationship with the U.S. too.

Earlier this month, Šefčovič said the bloc preferred to negotiate, “but not at any cost,” before announcing more than $100 billion worth of possible retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods the following day.

Europe also appears to be preparing for a future without America’s guarantee of European security against Russia. Germany this week deployed a permanent military brigade beyond its borders for the first time since the end of World War II.

A brewing trade war with the bloc throws into relief the position of Britain, which voted to leave the E.U. in 2016, but recently signed a trade deal with Europe and an economic deal with the U.S.

London appears to have sidestepped the steepest tariffs after Trump agreed last month to hold the levy on British goods at 10%, but the U.K. must now walk a delicate line: maintaining its “special relationship” with Washington while seeking closer alignment with its largest trading partner in Brussels.

But with tensions rising across the Atlantic, even allies risk being caught in the crossfire. The E.U. — a geopolitical heavyweight in its own right — is unlikely to take hefty U.S. tariffs lying down without making moves of its own.

“Mostly men, I think I was one of the maybe 5 women there,” she wrote. “Felt like 50/50 of people from the states compared to those from other countries — we met people from China, Philippines, Dubai, Korea, etc.”

The event has been widely criticized ever since its announcement, with government ethics experts and Democratic politicians decrying it as an extreme breach of presidential norms. Some Republican lawmakers also said the event made them uncomfortable. And while the emoluments clause of the Constitution gives Congress the power to limit the president from profiting off his position through foreign gifts, Trump’s broad embrace of crypto and many other businesses has gone far beyond what any previous president has done while in office.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment Friday. Earlier this week, a spokesperson said Trump “only acts in the best interests of the American public.”

As for the meme coin, which launched in January, Trump’s interests are not entirely clear. While the website for the contest claims that Trump “is appearing at the dinner as a guest and not soliciting any funds for it,” it also says that 80% of the $TRUMP coin project is owned by two Trump-affiliated companies, CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight LLC. The coin’s creators receive a transaction fee every time someone buys or sells the coin.

“You’re essentially allowing people who want to ingratiate themselves to put money directly into the president’s pocket, both people who are American citizens and permanent residents and foreign nationals,” said Dan Weiner, the director of the Elections and Government Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, ahead of Thursday’s event. “And that flies in the face of all of the norms we have built up around public service. It’s why every other president in recent memory, voluntarily, you know, divested from any assets that might pose a conflict of interest.”

The splashiest arrivals included Justin Sun, who had revealed his identity as the top buyer of $TRUMP ahead of the event, and Odom, who used to play for the Los Angeles Lakers but on Thursday night appeared promoting his own meme coin.

But alongside them was a lesser-known set of individuals. If they were among the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP coin, they also had the option to give their ticket to someone else, according to the published rules. Winners, or people who received tickets from them, were not allowed to bring guests.

NBC News requested comment from everyone it was able to identify. Most did not respond.

Some of the attendees had deep connections to the world of cryptocurrency.

Jack Lu, the CEO of the San Francisco-based NFT marketplace Magic Eden, posted a photo of himself at the event on X and was photographed entering the event by NBC News. Lu hadn’t previously posted about owning $TRUMP or about politics.

Alongside him in his photo was Magic Eden’s Chief Business Officer Chris Akhavan. In 2024, Akhavan tweeted about appearing at a Trump NFT event, but had not tweeted about potentially holding $TRUMP, according to a search by NBC News.

In the same photo was Clinton Bembry, the founder of Slingshot Finance, a crypto company that was recently acquired by Magic Eden. Bembry also had not previously posted about purchasing $TRUMP coin.

Another attendee, Michael Raumann, posted a signed menu on Instagram and was photographed outside the event. Raumann has worked for a German crypto startup, according to past media coverage and YouTube videos.

Stephen Hess, the founder of Metaplex, a platform that launches crypto products, posted a photo of himself ahead of the dinner and was photographed by NBC News outside of the event in a Metaplex hat. Mackenzie Hom, who leads strategy at the Cayman Islands-based Metaplex Foundation, was included in the photo and posted photographs from the event alongside Hess and Clay Helms, head of partnerships at the company.

Metaplex software “powered the $TRUMP token launch,” according to the dinner’s website.

Sandy Carter, chief operating officer of San-Francisco-based Unstoppable Domains, a blockchain-based web-hosting company, was also photographed at the event with the group of Metaplex executives. A former vice president at Amazon Web Services, she also posted several photos to X.

Bryce Paul, the chief investment officer of San Diego-area investment fund Tower 18 Capital, posted a selfie from the event on X. “Never stop fighting for what you believe in,” he wrote. He’s also the host of a crypto podcast and the author of a crypto book that’s marketed as, “How to make a fortune in the new crypto bull run… without needing much money.”

Another crypto owner, Kendall Davis, spoke to NBC News outside the event as he sparred with protesters. He said the industry had made him a multimillionaire after he previously was homeless, and he characterized his attendance as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to dine with a sitting president.

Many of the attendees maintained more discreet profiles. Brian Ng, a poker player from Massachusetts, was photographed entering the event, but did not post any identifiable content using his name. In a phone call, he confirmed he attended and said it was a great networking event.

Yasin Okan, who is based in Turkey and has worked as a flight attendant according to his X and LinkedIn profiles, posted on Instagram from the event. He did not respond to a request for comment.

New Zealand financial trader and amateur soccer player Dylan Stansfield was also photographed at the event. When reached for comment, Stansfield said he was “infuriated to have been identified” and that “‘doxxing’ crypto people put their lives at risk.”

There has been some growing cause for concern in the crypto world regarding personal security. In France, a string of violent kidnappings has targeted the crypto community in the last month.

Nick Pinto, an influencer who posted on TikTok, Instagram and X from the event, said others at the event were keen to maintain privacy.

“The attendees didn’t like cameras. A lot of times when an event photographer came around they’d reject the request for photos,” he told NBC News.

Pinto said he tried to get a photo with Trump when he appeared, but that Trump’s appearance was brief.

“He gave his speech and then immediately left. I wrote ‘Can I get picture?’ on my phone screen using Snapchat text like people do at concerts, and I know that he read it as he looked at me several times during his speech. I was at the front of the line. He didn’t even stay to personally hand the watches to the top four people that paid eight figures to get that rank.”

This week, Julie Eshelman has been holding her breath, waiting to see if President Donald Trump delivers on his campaign promise to make in vitro fertilization free.

Eshelman is a military wife and, thanks to IVF, a mom. She first began fertility treatments in 2016, and she and her husband finally welcomed a baby girl — five years, several miscarriages and $80,000 later.

“It’s been a financial burden, but it’s one that we would do over and over again so that we can have our family,” Eshelman told NBC News.

She couldn’t have imagined then that Trump’s second term as president might factor heavily in her decision about whether or not to try for a second baby.

“Hearing presidential candidates and the president talking about IVF — those things weren’t happening five years ago or 10 years ago,” she said, reflecting on the 2024 campaign. “I’m trying to be hopefully optimistic, but there definitely is that side of me that is skeptical of what is to come.”

Trump told NBC News on the campaign trail last year that if he is elected, his administration would work to make IVF paid for by either the government or insurance companies. The proposal came amid broader political conflict on family policies and abortion in 2024, after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos were considered people under state law, forcing pauses in IVF care before legislators passed a new law.

After he took office, Trump signed an executive order in February asking for a list of policy recommendations on “protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.” That 90-day deadline came and went Monday. The White House has not provided an estimate on when it will release its findings.

Details about the discussions that took place over the last 90 days from fertility professionals suggest the talks have been wide-ranging — including those who are eager for the administration to take immediate action to open up access to expensive fertility treatments, as well as some who cautioned the White House away from focusing on IVF.

“As exciting as the executive order was … it doesn’t have any actual actions in it,” said TJ Farnsworth, president of Fertility Providers Alliance and the founder of a chain of fertility clinics.

Farnsworth says FPA, a trade group of reproductive medicine providers, wrote a letter to the White House laying out a “broad spectrum” of ideas for the administration. The White House responded and invited him to meet in March.

“We brought to the table a fairly broad set of ideas,” said Farnsworth, including training programs to address a shortage of fertility providers in the United States, providing coverage for federal employees and providing more robust coverage for active-duty members of the military.

“There’s a thought that there is coverage for our military,” he said. “They failed to understand how limited that coverage was … and so they were interested to hear about that.”

Farnsworth said he was also eager to address a division in Trump’s base — opposition to IVF from anti-abortion activists and others who believe life begins at conception and therefore believe embryos are people, not to be discarded over the course of fertility treatments.

“There’s sometimes a competing narrative of whether or not what we do in an IVF clinic and fertility services are congruent with pro-life movements, and so we wanted to make it clear to them, from our perspective, we consider ourselves the definition of pro-life,” Farnsworth said. “If you could only create a couple of a certain number of embryos every time you wanted to attempt pregnancy, it would skyrocket the cost of services for patients.”

“I think they were also excited to hear the idea that there is no fertility clinic in the country anymore that creates dozens and dozens of embryos,” he said of the administration.

The White House also met with members of groups who are opposed to IVF.

After Trump signed his executive order in February, the Catholic Medical Association put out a statement calling on the administration to “reconsider its promotion of IVF” in favor of “more ethical and effective measures to address infertility.” The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops put out a similar statement.

Both groups called for the White House to instead focus its efforts on restorative reproductive medicine, which supporters say addresses the “root cause” of infertility. The approach is also supported by the Heritage Foundation.

The White House met with some who favor restorative reproductive medicine over IVF.

​​“I felt like there was interest. I felt like they asked thoughtful questions,” said Dr. Marguerite Duane, co-founder of FACTS About Fertility and a proponent of restorative reproductive medicine.

“They asked the question, how scalable is it? How easy is it for women to learn to track their cycle?” she said.

In a statement to NBC News, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, “Expanding IVF access for everyday Americans who have been struggling to start families is a key priority for President Trump. The Administration’s close coordination with outside stakeholder groups across the political spectrum to inform our IVF access plan reflects our commitment to delivering on this priority for the American people.”

The inclusion of groups opposed to IVF and the administration’s elimination of the team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that tracked the use and success of the procedure have alarmed some groups in the space, including major advocacy groups who were not invited to meet with the White House.

“We have worked very closely with a team at the CDC who worked on IVF,” said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, a patient advocacy group. “I’d certainly want the best and smartest and experienced people surrounding me on that particular topic, and that’s who those people were. So they are now gone, and so they certainly cannot weigh in and provide any input on these policy recommendations.”

Fertility experts have also questioned why the White House did not include the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in its talks.

Sean Tipton, the chief policy officer for both groups, told NBC News the groups reached out repeatedly to the White House and never heard back.

“It’s hard to understand why the White House would not want to meet with us. We have led efforts in states on IVF access for years. It’s a topic we know a little something about,” he said.

Since having her daughter, Eshelman has channeled her energy into helping other military families navigate infertility and extra challenges that come along with military service. She founded an advocacy group called Building Military Families.

“Every time we move, we have to re-establish care,” she said. “That process and the expense of having to transport our embryos from state to state just adds to all of that, and that’s definitely something that we’ve talked about recently is, you know, do we want to try again? Can we afford to try again?”

Eshelman says she’s trying to remain hopeful — but she thinks there are things Trump could do right now to help families like hers.

“I don’t think they needed 90 days to gather those policy recommendations. There’s a lot of legislation that has been introduced over the last several years that is already there, and they could get it done this week if they really wanted to,” she said. “For me, actions speak louder than words, and the actions that have been taken so far don’t really change the status quo.”

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s executive order against the Jenner & Block law firm is unlawful because it violates the First Amendment, a judge ruled late Friday.

U.S. District Judge John Bates said going after law firms the way Trump has “is doubly violative of the Constitution" because it targets Jenner & Block due to the causes the firm champions, the clients they represent, and a lawyer they once employed.

“This order, like the others, seeks to chill legal representation the administration doesn’t like, thereby insulating the Executive Branch from the judicial check fundamental to the separation of powers," Bates wrote. "It thus violates the Constitution and the Court will enjoin its operation in full.”

Bates noted that not every firm targeted by the administration opted to sue, seeming to critique those firms who threw in the towel and agreed to give the Trump administration free legal assistance.

"Without ever receiving an executive order, these firms preemptively bargained with the administration and struck deals sparing them. The deals largely mirror Paul Weiss’s, though the price continues to rise: instead of $40 million, these firms have pledged $100 million or more in pro bono legal services the administration has a hand in choosing," Bates wrote. "And in public statements, the President has floated the prospect of deploying the firms to work on the administration’s own projects, rather than traditional pro bono causes, while acknowledging the firms’ lack of wrongdoing."

Bates was skeptical of the Justice Department's arguments during a hearing last month.

In a statement Friday, Jenner & Block said it was "pleased with the court’s decision to decisively strike down an unconstitutional attack on our clients’ right to have zealous, independent counsel and our firm’s right to represent our clients fully and without compromise."

"This ruling demonstrates the importance of lawyers standing firm on behalf of clients and for the law," the law firm said. "That is what Jenner will continue to do for our clients — paying and pro bono — as we look to put this matter behind us."

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell previously struck down Trump's executive order targeting Perkins Coie, issuing a permanent injunction after finding Trump's order "violates the Constitution and is thus null and void."

Sunderland have been promoted back to the Premier League for the first time since 2017 as the Black Cats fought back to beat Sheffield United 2-1 in a dramatic Championship playoff final at Wembley on Saturday.

The Blades took the lead through Tyrese Campbell and had several chances to build on it as Chris Wilder’s side were dominant.

However, Sunderland struck twice late on as Eliezer Mayenda equalized with less than 15 minutes to go and then substitute Tom Watson curled home in stoppage time to send the Black Cats back to the Premier League as their fans were in dreamland.

19-year-old Watson has already signed for Brighton and will be joining them this summer, so he knew he would be in the Premier League next season. But his final action for Sunderland has sent them to the big time too.

Sunderland were the underdogs in this final but manager Regis Le Bris, in his first year managing in England, has pulled off an almighty upset to get them into the Premier League as they have so many young players and expectations were low going into this season. Now they can dream of the Premier League and the Tyne-Wear Derby is back as their fierce rivalry with Newcastle United is renewed.

Sunderland join Leeds United and Burnley in gaining promotion to the Premier League for the 2025-26 season.

Exciting Sunderland youngsters will have no fear

This team was the youngest in second-tier history to play in the playoffs and they won it. Nobody expected this. They’ve only been in the Championship for three seasons as most of this team were playing together in League One a few years ago. Sunderland limped towards the finish line at the end of the season (they lost their last five games of the regular season) as they pretty much occupied fourth place in the Championship table all season long. That meant they had plenty of time to prepare for the playoffs and whatever ground work Regis Le Bris did to prepare them for these high-pressure games worked superbly. Sunderland beat Coventry City in dramatic fashion in the 122nd minute of their semifinal second leg to reach the final and they turned the final around with 15 minutes to go to win it in stoppage time again. That tells you that they have absolutely no fear and that will hold them in good stead in the Premier League next season. They will obviously need to strengthen massively and we know how hard it has been for the newly-promoted to survive in recent seasons. But Sunderland are a huge club and will approach the Premier League in a pragmatic manner, hanging in games and then using their talented youngsters to cause upsets. From Jobe Bellingham and Mayenda to local lads Anthony Patterson and Dan Neil, Sunderland have invested in youth and it has got them back to the big time. It will be intriguing to see how much further these youngsters will go, especially if some experienced players like Sunderland fan Jordan Henderson (who watched the final at Wembley) are added to the mix. This was a very unexpected promotion and it feels like Sunderland have the potential to stick around in the top-flight if they can add a few key experienced players this summer to support their talented crop of youngsters.

Out of absolutely nothing Sunderland are level! Roberts plays in Mayenda and he smashes home at the near post. With less than 15 minutes to go it’s 1-1 and game on. The Sunderland fans go wild and Luke O’Nien, with his arm in a sling, is leading the celebrations as he charges down the touchline to celebrate with Mayenda. Can Sunderland go on and win this now!? Sheffield United will be kicking themselves. This has been so easy for them up until that equalizer. They should be out of sight!

Brooks so close to a second!

Dennis Cirkin makes a mess of a bouncing ball and hesitates as the last man. Substitute Andre Brooks nips in but his shot is saved well by Patterson. Nervous moment for Sunderland.

Really good chance on the counter for the Blades

Sheffield United again launch a brilliant counter but Kieffer Moore’s shot is blocked with Campbell waiting for the pass. Sunderland eventually clear and they got back really well. Just over 35 minutes to go.

Half time: Sheffield United 1-0 Sunderland

The Blades are 45 minutes away from a return straight back to the Premier League and they’ve been really good. Sunderland are yet to really get going but the good news for them is they’re only 1-0 down. Can the Black Cats get Jobe Bellingham on the ball more in the second half?

VAR review after Burrows smashes home... but no goal!

A corner is whipped in and is cleared to the edge of the box. Burrows smashes home through a crowd and the Sheffield United players and fans go wild. But hang on. Souza was running out in front of Sunderland goalkeeper Antony Patterson and was in an offside position and impacting play. VAR asks the ref to have a look at the goal and he decides that Souza was impacting Patterson. No goal. Huge roar goes up from the Sunderland fans.

Tyrese Campbell clips home! — Sheffield United 1-0 Sunderland

The Blades are ahead! They’ve looked the more dangerous and Sheffield United are ahead. After a corner for Sunderland is cleared, Sheffield United launch a counter through Hamer and picks out Tyrese Campbell perfectly and he controls so well and dinks calmly over the goalkeeper. They deserve this lead.

O’Nien has to come off with a dislocated shoulder

This is not good for Sunderland. Key center back Luke O’Nien is down as he looked to pop his shoulder out as he tried to challenge Moore when that header came in. He’s on oxygen. Chris Mepham is on in his place.

Patterson denies Moore’s header with a superb stop!

What a save. A cross is whipped in from the left and Kieffer Moore powers a header towards the bottom corner. It looks certain to go in but Anthony Patterson does brilliantly to claw the ball out. Great start from the Blades. Sunderland are really struggling.

Sheffield United lineup

Cooper; Choudhury, Ahmedhodzic, RObinson, Burrows; Brewster, Peck, Souza, Hamer; Moore, Campbell

Sheffield United vs Sunderland preview

Wembley Stadium will be a sea of red and white stripes next Saturday, May 24 (10 am ET). Sheffield United couldn’t have had an easier time in the semifinals of the promotion playoffs as Chris Wilder’s side beat Bristol City 3-0 in both legs. Sunderland, on the other hand, needed every single second of the 210 minutes of regular and extra time to see off Frank Lampard and Haji Wright’s Coventry City. It was 2-1 to Sunderland after the first leg and Regis Le Bris’s side was 15 minutes from advancing with a 0-0 draw at home, but the Sky Blues equalized in the 76th minute to extend the tie 30 more minutes. With 121:52 on the clock, Enzo Le Fee sent a corner kick into the penalty area and Dan Ballard headed it home with the last meaningful touch of the game.

Sheffield United are attempting to return to the Premier League at the first time of asking after finish last and being relegated this time last year, for the second time in four seasons. The Blades came back up after two seasons the last time they went down. The wait has been a little longer for Sunderland, who left the Premier League back in 2017 after 10 seasons in the top flight and haven’t been back since. The Black Cats suffered back-to-back relegations (and last-place finishes) back then and spent four seasons toiling in League One, now just one game away from a return to the big time after their third season in the Championship.

British professional boxer Georgia O’Connor has died aged 25, her promotion company BOXXER said on Thursday.

"We are heartbroken by the passing of Georgia O’Connor," BOXXER said in a statement on X. "A true warrior inside and outside the ring, the boxing community has lost a talented, courageous and determined young woman far too soon."

O'Connor's death comes months after the British boxer shared with fans that she was suffering from cancer.

"For 17 weeks since the start of October, I’ve been in constant pain, going back and forth between Durham and Newcastle RVI A&E knowing deep down something was seriously wrong,” O’Connor wrote. "I said from the start I felt it was cancer. I KNEW the risks. I have colitis and PSC, two diseases that dramatically increase the chances of getting it. I KNOW how high my risk is and they do too. They always did."

O'Connor, who was from Durham, England, did not share what type of cancer she was suffering from.

In the same January Instagram post, she also accused doctors of not taking her concerns seriously.

"Not one doctor did the scans or blood tests I begged for whilst crying on the floor in agony.Instead, they dismissed me. They gaslit me, told me it was nothing, made me feel like I was overreacting," she wrote. "They refused to scan me. They refused to investigate. They REFUSED to listen."

In February, the 25 year old also shared on Instagram that she suffered from a miscarriage.

“The last few months have been a rollercoaster,” O’Connor wrote. “I’ve been pregnant with a beautiful baby, suffered a miscarriage, then got diagnosed with ‘incurable’ cancer. But I still feel on top of the world!”

Last week, the boxer shared with 40,000 Instagram followers that she got married earlier this month. She posted an image of her holding her husband's hand and wrote: “09.05.2025. The day I married the love of my life."

In a separate Instagram post from February, O'Connor said that her then-boyfriend quit his job to support her through cancer.

The 2025 NBA postseason has unmistakably been shaped by trades — deals that landed big man Karl-Anthony Towns in New York, All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton in Indiana and future league MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in Oklahoma City.

Among the four remaining teams, however, no trade was more high-risk, high-reward than the Minnesota Timberwolves' decision in September, coming off one of the most successful seasons in franchise history, to send Towns, a franchise cornerstone, to the Knicks.

In one way, it was a reaction to the NBA’s year-old collective bargaining agreement, which makes it more difficult to keep expensive, deep rosters together for long by taking away top-spending teams’ ability to draft and make trades. Towns was set to begin a four-year contract worth more than $220 million, and the players Minnesota received, reserve guard Donte DiVincenzo and forward Julius Randle, earned less this season combined than Towns.

The financial flexibility in the trade "allows them to remake the team around Anthony Edwards" in the long term, said Chris Hine, the longtime Timberwolves beat writer for the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

But the move was also effectively a belief that Towns' big-man replacement in the deal, Randle, could serve as a reasonable facsimile. It was a gamble: that Randle, a regular-season All-Star whose history of postseason struggles had soured his time in New York, could help push a Timberwolves franchise with its own lack of playoff history over the top and into the team’s first Finals.

Minnesota trails Oklahoma City, 1-0, in the Western Conference finals, but Randle has remade his postseason reputation, averaging 24.3 points and 5.5 assists while making 58% of his 2-pointers and nearly 40% of his 3-pointers. The Timberwolves have made conference finals in consecutive seasons for the first time.

"I don't get into the narratives of having something to prove. The only thing I want to prove is I'm a winner," Randle said after Minnesota beat Golden State in a second-round series in five games.

In these playoffs, Randle shot 50% on nearly 100 possessions when he was guarded primarily by LeBron James during the first round, and he shot 58% when he was guarded by perennial Defensive Player of the Year candidate Draymond Green during the second. Overall, Randle has attempted fewer 3-pointers but made more and handled the ball less but generated more points. In the Game 1 loss to Oklahoma City, Randle scored 20 of Minnesota’s 48 points at halftime.

The turnaround was most evident against Golden State. In Game 3, with the series tied, Randle produced a triple-double despite a poor shooting performance by assisting on 12 baskets. He averaged 25 points during the series. On the approximately 105 possessions in which Green guarded Randle, the Timberwolves scored 105 points, and Randle shot 58%, according to NBA data.

"I lost my matchup," Green said on his podcast, adding it had happened only one other time during his lengthy postseason career. "Julius was incredible. And honestly, some of the shots he was taking was shots that you want him to take, and he made them. ... I got to give it to him, man. He got the better of me."

Randle, 30 — the No. 7 pick in the 2014 draft —entered the NBA with expectations that he could produce like this, only to have them immediately undercut; 14 minutes into his NBA debut, he broke his leg. It wasn't until his sixth season, in New York, that he became a team's top offensive option. It led to the first of his three All-Star appearances with the Knicks. Yet he was criticized for making 34.4% of his shots during two postseason runs with the Knicks — well below his 47.1% career average.

In September, he called the trade a “breath of fresh air,” but it came with immediate struggles. He averaged 18.7 points per game, his lowest average in eight seasons, and he wasn’t an All-Star for the first time in three. When the Timberwolves started the season an unremarkable 8-10, their star guard, Edwards, made a remarkable admission.

“We playing with a bunch of little kids. Everybody, the whole team,” Edwards said Nov. 27. “We just can’t talk to each other. And we’ve got to figure it out.”

The transformation took place gradually. Whereas Randle focused on scoring during his first months with Minnesota, upon returning from a groin injury in early March, he was playing a point-forward role devised by coach Chris Finch.

Minnesota was 17-4 after Randle returned from injury, a stretch that turned a team of ill-fitting parts into one that would beat the Lakers and the Warriors in consecutive rounds in five games.

“Randle points to his injury as helping him gain some perspective on how the offense should operate,” Hine said. “He saw how well the Wolves were doing on that end of the floor when they could generate good ball movement. After trying to find the right balance between scoring and distributing, he shifted more toward the playmaking end of that dynamic, and that made a big difference for him and the Wolves.”

Since Jan. 22, Minnesota is 30-7 with Randle in the lineup and 14 points better offensively with him on the court (though also seven points worse defensively).

“I think his relationship with Chris Finch played a big part” of Randle’s getting comfortable, Hine said. “The two knew each other dating back to when they were both in New Orleans. Randle came in praising Finch’s coaching ability and how great their year was together from his opening press conference.

“Despite frustration in the fan base with Randle’s fit, Finch always stood by Randle, kept telling him they would figure it all out, and sure enough they did. I think his re-emergence is a credit to Finch having that relationship and patience with him and a credit to Randle for sticking with it when other players might have given up."

The Indiana Pacers are headed home, halfway to a chance to play for an elusive NBA title.

They might prefer to stay right where they are.

Pascal Siakam scored a playoff career-high 39 points, and the Pacers beat the New York Knicks 114-109 on Friday night for a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference finals.

Game 3 is Sunday night in Indiana, which will be rocking all day long with the Indianapolis 500 being run that afternoon. The Pacers can only hope to be as good there as they’ve been on the road, where they have won six straight games since falling at Milwaukee in Game 3 of the first round.

“We have a long way to go and it’s only going to get tougher for us,” Siakam said.

Myles Turner added 16 points and Tyrese Haliburton had 14 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds for the Pacers, who lost to the Lakers in 2000 in their only NBA Finals appearance.

Siakam finished 15 for 23 from the field on a night nobody else on the high-scoring Pacers had more than five baskets.

“Special game,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “In the first half he was the guy that got us going and got us through some difficult stretches.”

Jalen Brunson had 36 points and 11 assists for the Knicks, who need a quick turnaround or their first appearance in the conference finals in 25 years will be a brief one. They defended much better after their crushing collapse in a 138-135 overtime loss in Game 1, but couldn’t find enough scoring to come back after a bad start to the fourth quarter.

Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns each had 20 points and seven rebounds for the Knicks, but Towns played just 28 minutes as coach Tom Thibodeau went longer with backup Mitchell Robinson, a much better defender who grabbed nine rebounds.

No team has lost the first two games at home and come back to win a series in the conference finals.

“Going into the fourth quarter it’s a tie ballgame. We’ve just got to make better plays, more winning plays,” Thibodeau said.

It was tied at 81 after three, before the Pacers opened the fourth with a 13-4 run to move ahead 94-85 on Siakam’s 3-pointer with 9:17 remaining. They would quickly push the margin back to around there every time the Knicks got any momentum, and it was 110-100 after another basket by Siakam with 2:45 to play.

The Knicks scored nine straight to make it 110-109 on Josh Hart’s basket with 14 seconds to go. Aaron Nesmith made two free throws for the Pacers, Brunson was well off on a 3-point attempt and Turner finished it out with two free throws.

The 50th playoff meeting between the rivals — the Pacers lead 28-22, all since 1993 — more closely resembled their defensive battles of the 1990s than the shootout of two nights earlier.

Indiana raced to a 19-9 lead, but the Knicks quickly caught them when Robinson and Deuce McBride entered and the game remained within a single-digit margin nearly the entire rest of the night.

MINNEAPOLIS — Anthony Edwards had 30 points, nine rebounds and six assists in just three quarters to lead the re-energized Minnesota Timberwolves in a 143-101 victory over Oklahoma City on Saturday night in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals that cut the Thunder’s lead in the series to 2-1.

Julius Randle added 24 points and rookie Terrence Shannon Jr. had 15 points in 13 minutes to highlight a big boost from the bench for the Wolves, who caused all kinds of cracks in the Thunder’s NBA -best defense after struggling to solve it in the two lopsided losses on the road.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had just 14 points on 4-for-13 shooting with four turnovers, subbed out with a 38-point deficit and 4:25 to go in the third quarter as Thunder coach Mark Daigneault conceded on a night when his team was never closer than 22 points after early in the second quarter.

Game 4 is in Minneapolis on Monday night.

The travel north and venue shift triggered a sharp drop in shooting for the Thunder, who made exactly half of their attempts from the floor over the first two games and went just 12 for 40 in the first half on Saturday.

Gilgeous-Alexander, the newly minted NBA MVP, went more than 13 minutes of game time between baskets while the Target Center crowd loudly booed him on every touch and taunted him at the line with the chant, “Free throw merchant!” in a nod to the popular notion he draws an inordinate amount of fouls.

The Thunder fully expected a strong response from the Wolves after opening the series with two lopsided wins. This was a bone-jarring counterpunch from the opening tip that kept the crowd roaring all the way through the finish, without any of the half-quarter meltdowns that doomed them in Oklahoma City.

Randle, who had his first off night of this postseason in a Game 2 performance so disjointed he was benched for the fourth quarter, had his fire back — and his signature fadeaway.

Edwards rediscovered his 3-point shot, going 5 for 8 after shooting just 1 of 9 in Game 2. He gave the quick-handed, ball-pressuring Thunder a taste of what it’s like to play against themselves with a couple of relentless of loose balls he turned into breakaway dunks.

Outscored 69-37 in the third quarter over the first two games, the Wolves didn’t even leave the door open a crack for the Thunder to start a second-half comeback. Edwards, tightly guarded by Isaiah Joe in the corner, found enough space to drive along the baseline and spin an up-and-under reverse layup off the glass for a 79-52 lead.

Jonquel Jones had 26 points and 12 rebounds and Sabrina Ionescu added 23 points, including the winning free throws with 2.9 seconds left, to lead the New York Liberty over the Indiana Fever 90-88 on May 24.

Caitlin Clark, who ended a stretch of 12 missed 3-pointers with a four-point play followed by a 33-foot buzzer-beater to end the third quarter, had the ball stripped away by Natasha Cloud on the final play of the game. She finished with 18 points, 10 assists and 10 turnovers, shooting 2 for 11 from 3.

Breanna Stewart and Cloud had 16 points each for the Liberty (3-0).

Aliyah Boston led Indiana (2-2) with 27 points and 13 rebounds. Lexie Hull, starting in place of DeWanna Bonner, and Kelsey Mitchell added 15 points each.

Clark’s turnovers were scattered between precise feeds to the rim to her teammates, including Boston, who bounced back from a four-point performance in a win over the Atlanta Dream on Thursday.

The Fever had an 80-68 lead with less than nine minutes remaining in the game. It was an impressive midgame run for the newly formed Fever against the reigning WNBA champs, having stormed back from down 14 early in the second quarter.

But the Liberty’s experience showed up when it mattered. Jones, Stewart and Ionescu brought them quickly back into the game. They went on a 14-2 run for an 84-82 lead after Jones drained consecutive 3-pointers.

Clark said after the game she’d have to look at the tape to tell whether she was fouled on the final play. Coach Stephanie White, however, wasn’t as neutral.

“I think it’s pretty egregious what’s been happening to us the last four games, you know, a minus-31 free throw discrepancy,” White said. “And I might be able to understand it if we were just chucking 3s. But we’re not. We’re attacking the rim and the disrespect right now for our team has been pretty unbelievable.”

Up next

The Liberty head home to play a pair of games against expansion Golden State on Tuesday and Thursday. Indiana is at Washington on Wednesday.

Sunderland have been promoted back to the Premier League for the first time since 2017 as the Black Cats fought back to beat Sheffield United 2-1 in a dramatic Championship playoff final at Wembley on Saturday.

The Blades took the lead through Tyrese Campbell and had several chances to build on it as Chris Wilder’s side were dominant.

However, Sunderland struck twice late on as Eliezer Mayenda equalized with less than 15 minutes to go and then substitute Tom Watson curled home in stoppage time to send the Black Cats back to the Premier League as their fans were in dreamland.

19-year-old Watson has already signed for Brighton and will be joining them this summer, so he knew he would be in the Premier League next season. But his final action for Sunderland has sent them to the big time too.

Sunderland were the underdogs in this final but manager Regis Le Bris, in his first year managing in England, has pulled off an almighty upset to get them into the Premier League as they have so many young players and expectations were low going into this season. Now they can dream of the Premier League and the Tyne-Wear Derby is back as their fierce rivalry with Newcastle United is renewed.

Sunderland join Leeds United and Burnley in gaining promotion to the Premier League for the 2025-26 season.

Exciting Sunderland youngsters will have no fear

This team was the youngest in second-tier history to play in the playoffs and they won it. Nobody expected this. They’ve only been in the Championship for three seasons as most of this team were playing together in League One a few years ago. Sunderland limped towards the finish line at the end of the season (they lost their last five games of the regular season) as they pretty much occupied fourth place in the Championship table all season long. That meant they had plenty of time to prepare for the playoffs and whatever ground work Regis Le Bris did to prepare them for these high-pressure games worked superbly. Sunderland beat Coventry City in dramatic fashion in the 122nd minute of their semifinal second leg to reach the final and they turned the final around with 15 minutes to go to win it in stoppage time again. That tells you that they have absolutely no fear and that will hold them in good stead in the Premier League next season. They will obviously need to strengthen massively and we know how hard it has been for the newly-promoted to survive in recent seasons. But Sunderland are a huge club and will approach the Premier League in a pragmatic manner, hanging in games and then using their talented youngsters to cause upsets. From Jobe Bellingham and Mayenda to local lads Anthony Patterson and Dan Neil, Sunderland have invested in youth and it has got them back to the big time. It will be intriguing to see how much further these youngsters will go, especially if some experienced players like Sunderland fan Jordan Henderson (who watched the final at Wembley) are added to the mix. This was a very unexpected promotion and it feels like Sunderland have the potential to stick around in the top-flight if they can add a few key experienced players this summer to support their talented crop of youngsters.

On a darkened sidewalk outside the Capital Jewish Museum, he walked past the young couple, then shot them both point-blank in the back. When the woman tried to crawl away, an FBI affidavit says, he reloaded his weapon and fired at her again and again.

“Free Palestine,” the man shouted after walking into the building and waiting to be arrested by police.

The brutal killing of two Israeli Embassy staffers in downtown Washington on Wednesday night raises the kind of question that haunts law enforcement officials and experts.

Of all the people seething with anger on the far left and the far right over hot-button political and social issues, who among them will move from anger to violence?

“It’s virtually impossible” to identify them, said Gregg McCrary, a former FBI profiler. “It’s not trying to find the needle in the haystack. It’s trying to find which piece of hay is going to become a needle.”

In recent months, the U.S. has seen a spate of politically motivated, lone wolf attacks — the hardest kind for law enforcement to prevent — and they come as the Trump administration is shifting resources away from focusing on domestic extremism.

While a large majority of domestic terror attacks and plots in the U.S. over the last 20 years were fueled by right-wing ideologies, recent high-profile violence from people fueled by left-wing ideologies underscores how volatile the U.S. is today.

“I think there has been an increased acceptance in the use of violence against people that we call our enemies,” said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. “And I think that cuts both ways.”

The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, 31, of Chicago, was charged with first-degree murder Thursday in the killing of Sarah Milgrim, 26, and her boyfriend, Yaron Lischinsky, 30, after an American Jewish Committee event. According to the FBI affidavit, Rodriguez told officers at the scene he “did it for Gaza.”

Dr. Park Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist who has consulted for the FBI for decades, said he believes the factors driving attacks like the one in Washington include the bitter political polarization as well as the dark corners of the internet where “people find support for any ludicrous and extreme position from similarly situated angry people.”

The animating issues for the left include Israel’s killing of innocent Palestinians in Gaza and the Trump administration’s deporting of migrants without due process. On the right, the issues include pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses and what they consider “woke” ideology.

“The risks are higher today because of the polarization of so many parts of the population, and because of the rise of grievance-fueled violence of several kinds,” added Dietz, who runs a California-based company, the Threat Assessment Group, dedicated to preventing workplace violence. “It comes from both the left and the right. It’s not the monopoly of any one political position.”

Law enforcement experts say it’s maddeningly difficult to prevent attacks carried out by lone individuals who are not on the radar of authorities and don’t signal their plans. Authorities said that Rodriguez had no previous criminal record and was not being monitored by police or the FBI.

And that job has gotten harder because of changes made to the FBI and Justice Department in the first few months of the Trump administration, according to more than a dozen current and former law enforcement officials who’ve spoken with NBC News.

Dozens of employees have been transferred out of the FBI’s Domestic Terrorism Operations Section, three sources told NBC News, with one person describing the unit as a “ghost town.”

John W. Sullivan III, who was a senior FBI official until he resigned from the bureau in early spring after 17 years, said that the FBI’s shift away from domestic terror threats under Director Kash Patel has led to frustration and serious security concerns.

“There’s a lot of confusion and frustration inside the organization about how much less safe we are being made by defocusing on certain threats, in particular, domestic terrorism,” said Sullivan, who is now running for Congress in New York as a Democrat.

In a statement, the bureau said that the FBI “continuously analyzes the threat landscape and allocates resources and personnel in alignment with that analysis and the investigative needs of the Bureau.”

“We make adjustments and changes based on many factors and remain flexible as various needs arise,” the bureau said. “The FBI’s role in and dedication to investigating terrorism, both domestically and internationally, has not changed.”

Over the past decade, white supremacists and other right-wing extremists were responsible for many significant acts of violence in the U.S. These include:

According to the Anti-Defamation League, right-wing ideologies have fueled more than 70% of the extremist attacks and domestic terror plots in the U.S. since 2002.

But over the past 18 months, the U.S. has seen a string of high-profile attacks fueled at least in part by left-wing ideologies.

Among the most notable examples is the attempt on Trump’s life in August 2024. Prosecutors say the man who was charged with attempting to kill Trump at his Florida golf course wrote letters denouncing the then-presidential candidate.

Perhaps most striking was the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City in December.

Prosecutors say the man charged with the crime, Luigi Mangione, 27, was motivated by animus toward health insurance companies. The killing became a rallying point in some left-wing spaces that have glorified and celebrated such violence, and in some instances called for more. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to federal and state charges.

Podcasters on the left and right and social media platforms have proliferated in recent years, and so has hate speech directed at Jews from both sides, as well as at Muslims, experts say.

Oren Segal, the Anti-Defamation League’s senior vice president for counterextremism and intelligence, noted that the uber-popular podcaster Joe Rogan has recently hosted antisemitic conspiracy theorists. (Challenged by another guest on his show about that, Rogan said: ”I didn’t bring him on for that purpose. I brought him on because I want to find out, like, how does one get involved in the whole conspiracy theory business? Because his whole thing is just conspiracies.”)

Segal said: “It’s no surprise that words animate violence, and the demonization of Israelis and Jews, along with the constant glorification of terrorist organizations, has created the environment that we’re in, making such tragedies like yesterday more likely.”

And for the radicalized who are tired of living in obscurity, carrying out an attack is a guaranteed way to gain attention.

“Fame is difficult to achieve,” said McCrary, the former FBI profiler. “Infamy is just a trigger pull away.”

Employees at the San Diego Humane Society are wearing bear costumes to tend to a cub that came into the organization's care last month. The reason they're dressing the part? To make sure the baby black bear doesn't bond too much with the humans raising it before they try to return the animal to the wild.

The two-month-old black bear cub is the youngest the organization has ever cared for, it said in a statement. It's the fourth bear this young in five years to enter rehabilitation care in California.

Campers in the Los Padres National Forest found the cub, weak, underweight and alone, on April 12, the humane society said. After failed attempts to reunite the cub with its mother in the wild, California Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists dropped the bear off April 14 at the San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center.

"Our team stepped in to give him the second chance he deserved," the humane society said on Instagram.

More than 30 days into its stay, the cub is stable, playful and thriving, the humane society said.

"He was extremely fragile when he arrived," said Autumn Welch, Wildlife Operations Manager at the Ramona Wildlife Center. "After going several days without nutrition, it was touch-and-go at first. But now, he's active, eating well and gaining weight steadily."

The group plans on watching after the cub for up to a year, to prepare it to return to the wild once it's old and strong enough.

The organization said the state wildlife agency would try to pair the animal with another cub should one end up in state care, calling this "a critical strategy to keep orphaned cubs wild and reduce the risk of imprinting on humans."

The other strategy the organization is employing to ensure the little bear doesn't bond too much with his human caretakers: having its team wear bear suits "to mimic maternal behaviors," it said on Instagram.

The bear cub gets four enrichment and feeding sessions a day that will help to prepare it for life in the wild, the humane society said, noting the "extraordinary amount of time, expertise and resources" it takes to raise a bear from this young age. Welch also said it's rare to see cubs this young without their mothers.

Video shared on the organization's Instagram shows the bear climbing on a makeshift jungle gym in its enclosure and humane society workers playing with it with a stuffed bear toy.

“The president is attending it in his personal time. It is not a White House dinner. It’s not taking place here at the White House,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary.

But event organizers did not market it as a personal event. The dinner’s website says: “President Donald J. Trump is Known as the ‘Crypto President!’ At this Intimate Private Dinner, Hear First-Hand President Trump Talk about the Future of Crypto.”

According to multiple photos posted on X by people who said they were inside the event, Trump was due to speak from a podium with the presidential seal.

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said this week that Trump was not acting to enrich himself. “President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public — which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media,” she said.

Trump’s all-in dive into cryptocurrency is a sharp reversal from a few years ago, when he bashed the industry. “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” he said in a series of social media posts in 2019.

Like other meme coins, the $TRUMP coin is far from a traditional investment. It is not tied to anything with tangible value, and it is part of a carnival-casino atmosphere that has returned to cryptocurrency since Trump was re-elected in November.

The fine print on the website of the $TRUMP project says the coins “are intended to function as an expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol $TRUMP and are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.”

The secrecy around the invitation list set off a scramble to confirm who paid money to attend the dinner. The event’s website published a leaderboard of who owned the most $TRUMP coin, but with usernames instead of real names.

Using publicly available information from the coin’s blockchain recordkeeping system, Bloomberg News reported strong interest in the coin among non-Americans. According to Bloomberg, 19 of the top 25 holders bought on foreign exchanges that say they exclude U.S. customers, and 56% of the top 220 bought on those exchanges.

The top holder identified himself on X this week as Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto entrepreneur whom the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued in 2023, alleging fraud. The case is still pending, though the SEC has explored a possible settlement or dismissal following Trump’s second inauguration.

As people began arriving for the event, the price of $TRUMP dropped suddenly by about 6%, indicating a significant sales volume, before it stabilized again.

Protesters, meanwhile, used megaphones to amplify their chants while standing in the rain for hours. They included a mix of local Democratic groups, as well as the left-leaning group Public Citizen.

Rose Fabia, 66, a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs, said the event was a blatant example of corruption.

“These wealthy people, they’re just here to pay for access. That’s all it is,” she said. “And he’s taking advantage of it and saying, ‘How much are you gonna give me? How much you gonna pay for my crypto coin?’ It’s a joke. It’s corruption in our faces.”

One person at the dinner, Kendall Davis, sparred with protesters, rejecting their assertion that he is a blind supporter of Trump and implicitly advocating for his policies. Davis, a young Black crypto owner, said the industry has made him a multimillionaire after he previously was homeless. He characterized his attendance as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to dine with a sitting president.

“I don’t feel any type of remorse for coming here. My dad is Black. He’s proud of me. My grandma is Black. She’s proud of me. They’re Democrats,” he said. “Nobody in my family has ever ate with the president. Let me say this: If it was Joe Biden or Barack Obama, I would’ve came, too.”

Other people spotted at the dinner included Sandy Carter, the COO of blockchain-based Unstoppable Domains.

Joining the protesters was Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who talked up legislation — the End Crypto Corruption Act — that he introduced this month with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. The measure would prohibit senior executive branch officials, including the president, from financially benefiting from issuing, endorsing or sponsoring crypto assets.

“The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone because it’s to be government by and for the people, your constituents, not government by and for people who hand money across the table to you,” Merkley said.

Ukraine's capital came under a large-scale Russian drone and missile attack overnight and into early Saturday that left at least 15 people injured, according to Ukrainian officials. Explosions and machine gun fire were heard throughout Kyiv as many sought shelter in subway stations.

The attack came hours after Russia and Ukraine began a major prisoner exchange of hundreds of soldiers and civilians, the first phase of a swap agreed on by the two sides at a meeting in Istanbul last week.

The agreement was a rare moment of cooperation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the 3-year-old war.

Russia attacked Ukraine with 14 ballistic missiles and 250 Shahed drones overnight, officials said, adding that Ukrainian forces shot down 6 missiles and neutralized 245 drones — 128 drones were shot down and 117 were thwarted using electronic warfare.

The Kyiv City Military Administration said it was one of the most massive combined missile and drone attacks on the capital.

“A difficult night for all of us,” the administration said in a statement.

The debris of intercepted missiles and drones fell in at least six city districts of the Ukrainian capital. According to the acting head of Kyiv's military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, six people required medical care after the attack and two fires were sparked in the Solomianskyi district of Kyiv.

The Obolon district, where a residential building was heavily damaged in the attack, was the hardest hit. There were at least five wounded in the area, the administration said.

Yurii Bondarchuk, a local resident, said the air raid siren “started as usual, then the drones started to fly around as they constantly do.”

Moments later, he heard a boom and saw shattered glass fly through the air.

“The balcony is totally wiped out, as well as the windows and the doors,” he said, describing the damage to his apartment as he stood in the dark of the night, smoking a cigarette to calm his nerves while firefighters worked to extinguish the flames.

The air raid alert in Kyiv lasted more than seven hours, warning of incoming missiles and drones.

Kyiv's mayor, Vitalii Klitschko, warned residents ahead of the attack that more than 20 Russian strike drones were heading toward the city. As the attack continued, he said drone debris fell on a shopping mall and a residential building in Obolon district of Kyiv. Emergency services were headed to the site, Klitschko said.

The prisoner swap on Friday was the first phase of a complicated deal involving the exchange of 1,000 prisoners from each side.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the first phase of the deal brought home 390 Ukrainians, with further releases expected over the weekend, which will make it the largest swap of the war. Russia's Defense Ministry said it received the same number of people from Ukraine.

The swap took place at the border with Belarus, in northern Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

The released Russians were taken to Belarus for medical treatment, the Russian Defense Ministry said.

However, the exchange — the latest of dozens of swaps since the war began and the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians so far — did not herald a halt in the fighting.

Battles continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.

After the May 16 Istanbul meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan called the prisoner swap a “confidence-building measure” and said the parties had agreed in principle to meet again.

But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that there has been no agreement yet on the venue for the next round of talks as diplomatic maneuvering continued.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow would give Ukraine a draft document outlining its conditions for a “sustainable, long-term, comprehensive” peace agreement, once the ongoing prisoner exchange had finished.

European leaders have accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts while he tries to press his larger army's battlefield initiative and capture more Ukrainian land.

The Istanbul meeting revealed that both sides remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting. One such condition for Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement.

Russia's Defense Ministry said it had shot down 788 Ukrainian drones away from the battlefield between May 20 and May 23.

Ukraine's air force said Russia fired 175 Shahed and decoy drones, as well as a ballistic missile since late Thursday.

The Trump administration issued orders Friday that it said would effectively lift sanctions on Syria, after President Donald Trump this month pledged to unwind the measures to help the country rebuild after a devastating civil war.

The Treasury Department issued a general license that authorizes transactions involving the interim Syrian government led by President Ahmed al-Sharaa, as well as the central bank and state-owned enterprises.

The general license, known as GL25, “authorizes transactions prohibited by the Syrian Sanctions Regulations, effectively lifting sanctions on Syria,” the Treasury said in a statement.

“GL25 will enable new investment and private sector activity consistent with the President’s America First strategy,” the statement said.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio also issued a 180-day waiver under the Caesar Act to ensure that sanctions do not obstruct investment and to facilitate the provision of electricity, energy, water and sanitation and enable humanitarian efforts, he said in a statement.

“Today’s actions represent the first step in delivering on the President’s vision of a new relationship between Syria and the United States,” Rubio said, adding that Trump had made clear his expectation that sanctions relief would be followed by action by the Syrian government.

The White House said after Trump met Sharaa last week that the president asked Syria to adhere to several conditions in exchange for sanctions relief, including telling all foreign militants to leave Syria, deporting what he called Palestinian terrorists, and helping the U.S. prevent the resurgence of ISIS.

“President Trump is providing the Syrian government with the chance to promote peace and stability, both within Syria and in Syria’s relations with its neighbors,” Rubio said.

Syria welcomed the sanctions waiver early on Saturday, which the Foreign Ministry called a “positive step in the right direction to alleviate the country’s humanitarian and economic suffering.”

Syria is keen on cooperating with other countries “on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs. It believes that dialogue and diplomacy are the best path to building balanced relations,” the ministry said in a statement.

Most of the U.S. sanctions on Syria were imposed on the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and key individuals in 2011 after civil war erupted there. Sharaa led militias that overthrew Assad in December.

The general license names Sharaa, formerly sanctioned under the name Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani, among the people and entities with whom transactions are now authorized. It also lists Syrian Arab Airlines, the Central Bank of Syria and a number of other banks, several state oil and gas companies and the Four Seasons Damascus hotel.

Trump unexpectedly announced last week that he would lift the sanctions at the behest of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, a major U.S. policy shift he made before meeting briefly with Sharaa in Riyadh.

It is hoped that easing Syria sanctions will clear the way for greater engagement by humanitarian organizations working in Syria, encouraging foreign investment and trade as the country rebuilds. But the U.S. has imposed layers of measures against Syria, cutting it off from the international banking system and barring many imports, and the potential for sanctions on a country to return can chill private-sector investment.

The U.S. first put the country on its list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1979 and since then has added additional sets of sanctions, including several rounds following the country’s 2011 uprising against Assad.

Iranian and U.S. delegations wrapped up a fifth round of talks in Rome on Friday and signs of some limited progress emerged in the negotiations aimed at resolving a decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.

Despite both Washington and Tehran taking a tough stance in public ahead of the talks on Iran's uranium enrichment, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said there was potential for progress after Oman made several proposals during the talks.

“We have just completed one of the most professional rounds of talks... We firmly stated Iran‘s position... The fact that we are now on a reasonable path, in my view, is itself a sign of progress,” Araghchi told state TV.

“The proposals and solutions will be reviewed in respective capitals... and the next round of talks will be scheduled accordingly.”

A senior U.S. official said the talks lasted more than two hours and were both direct and indirect with Omani mediators.

“The talks continue to be constructive — we made further progress, but there is still work to be done. Both sides agreed to meet again in the near future. We are grateful to our Omani partners for their continued facilitation,” the official said.

The stakes are high for both sides. President Donald Trump wants to curtail Tehran’s potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could trigger a regional nuclear arms race and perhaps threaten Israel. The Islamic Republic, for its part, wants to be rid of devastating sanctions on its oil-based economy.

Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said on X the talks between Araghchi and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had ended “with some but not conclusive progress”.

Ahead of the talks, Araghchi wrote on X: “Zero nuclear weapons = we Do have a deal. Zero enrichment = we do NOT have a deal. Time to decide.”

Among remaining stumbling blocks are Tehran’s refusal to ship abroad its entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium — possible raw material for nuclear bombs — or engage in discussions over its ballistic missile program.

Diplomats have said reaching a concrete deal before the summer would technically be impossible given the complexities of an accord. In the meantime, a senior Iranian official involved in nuclear talks with the U.S. said “if Washington drops its ‘zero enrichment’ demand, a political agreement is feasible.”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday that Washington was working to reach an accord that would allow Iran to have a civil nuclear energy program but not enrich uranium, while acknowledging that this “will not be easy”.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last say on matters of state, rejected demands to stop refining uranium as “excessive and outrageous“, warning that such talks were unlikely to yield results.

Iran says it is ready to accept some limits on enrichment, but needs watertight guarantees that Washington would not renege on a future nuclear accord.

Trump in his first term in 2018 ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between major powers and Iran. Since returning to office this year, he has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran and reimposed sweeping U.S. sanctions that continue to hobble the Iranian economy.

Iran responded by escalating enrichment far beyond the 2015 pact’s limits.

Wendy Sherman, a former U.S. undersecretary who led the U.S. negotiating team that reached the 2015 agreement, earlier said that Tehran presents enrichment as a matter of sovereignty.

“I don’t think it is possible to get a deal with Iran where they literally dismantle their program, give up their enrichment, even though that would be ideal,” she told Reuters.

The cost of failure of the talks could be high. Iran‘s arch-foe Israel sees Iran‘s nuclear program as an existential threat and says it would never allow the clerical establishment to obtain nuclear weapons. Tehran says it has no such ambitions and the purposes are purely civilian.

Israel’s strategic affairs minister and the head of its foreign intelligence service, Mossad, were also due to be in Rome for talks with the U.S. negotiators, a source aware of the matter told Reuters.

Araghchi said Thursday that Washington would bear legal responsibility if Israel attacked Iranian nuclear installations, following a CNN report that Israel might be preparing strikes.

The Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday it would like drugmakers to update the Covid vaccines to target the LP.8.1 strain, fueling concerns that the shots may be limited to only the most at-risk Americans this fall.

The FDA’s decision differs slightly from the recommendation made by its vaccine advisory committee earlier that day, which was to stick to the strains used in the current Covid shots, although panel members said LP.8.1 was a suitable alternative.

Studies by Moderna and Pfizer showed that an LP.8.1-targeted vaccine in fact induced a modestly stronger immune response to the circulating strains than the current Covid shots, which target a variant called JN.1 or one of its descendants, KP.2.

LP.8.1 is also a descendent of JN.1, and it is the dominant strain circulating in the U.S., accounting for roughly 3 in 4 new Covid cases, according to FDA briefing documents released earlier this week. It’s different from a strain dubbed NB.1.8.1 that was recently detected in the U.S. and caused a surge in hospitalizations in China.

Normally, changing the strain for the vaccine wouldn’t raise questions — it's been the practice of the U.S. in recent years, following a similar model to how the flu shot is updated each year. For Pfizer and Moderna, their mRNA technology makes it particularly easy to update their vaccines.

But this year, the change is expected to trigger new rules by the FDA that new Covid vaccines for healthy kids and adults must undergo placebo-controlled clinical trials — a process Dr. Marty Makary, the agency’s commissioner, told a Senate committee on Thursday could take roughly a year.

The updated Covid shots are still expected to be available in the fall to adults 65 and up and kids and adults with at least one medical condition that puts them at risk for severe illness — two groups that are exempt from the clinical trial requirement.

The list of underlying conditions that raises a person's risk is extensive — “physical inactivity” is even included. Officials estimated that more than 100 million people in the U.S. would still qualify for a shot.

But the clinical trial requirement “would clearly delay and impede access to vaccines for those people who want it,” said Dr. Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and infectious disease at Georgetown University and a former chief scientist at the FDA.

However, Goodman added, a number of questions remain about the FDA’s policy, including how many people would be needed for the trials and whether a new strain selection would indeed trigger the new trial requirement.

When asked by committee members about the new policy on Thursday, FDA officials either said that the questions were off-topic or that the agency was still finalizing the details with drugmakers.

The FDA’s notice also states it would “preferentially” like drugmakers to update their shots to the LP.8.1 strain — potentially leaving room for drugmakers to stick to their existing formulations.

“I suspect we will learn more and their approach may become clearer and/or evolve in coming days,” Goodman said. He added it makes sense to leave room for drugmakers to update to either strain, noting it’s often difficult to predict how Covid will evolve.

The FDA directed all media inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services.

“The COVID-19 public health emergency has officially ended, and we are entering a new phase in our response to the virus,” Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS, wrote in an emailed statement. “A rubber-stamping approach to approving COVID boosters in perpetuity without updated clinical trial data under the Biden Administration is now over.”

In a statement, a Pfizer spokesperson directed NBC News to comments by the company Thursday, which stated it was prepared to “initiate supply of a 2025/2026 vaccine formula per FDA guidance, immediately upon approval.”

Moderna and Novavax did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

There are also questions about insurance coverage and whether patients who are ineligible for the shots would have to pay out of pocket if they wanted one.

Pfizer and Moderna are charging up to $150 per dose for a Covid vaccine, according to the CDC’s vaccine price list. The agency doesn’t list the cost of the Novavax vaccine, which was fully approved earlier this month.

In a statement, a spokesperson for America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, said, “Health plans have prioritized providing affordable access to preventive services, including vaccines.”

“We will continue to monitor the forthcoming recommendations and guidance from ACIP and CDC,” the spokesperson said, referring to the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee. “As of today, there is no change in how plans cover the existing vaccines for the previously recommended populations.”

The brain disorder that forced Billy Joel to cancel his concert tour can cause trouble walking and thinking straight — but is often treatable and can even be reversed, doctors said.

A post on the 76-year-old singer’s Instagram on Friday said that he was recently diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus and that concert performances exacerbated problems with his “hearing, vision, and balance.”

The condition is relatively uncommon, according to the Cleveland Clinic, affecting “about 5.9% of people over 80.”

It’s most commonly diagnosed in older adults, usually showing up around age 70.

What is normal pressure hydrocephalus?

The human body is constantly trying to keep a steady level of cerebrospinal fluid to cushion the brain and spinal cord, either by making more or absorbing it.

That fluid tends to take up a little more space in older adults because brain volume shrinks as a normal part of the aging process, said Dr. Wajd Al-Holou, a neurosurgeon at the University of Michigan Health.

"But what happens in normal pressure hydrocephalus is an abnormal buildup of fluid that causes brain dysfunction because of the pressure it's putting on the brain," he said.

What are the symptoms and how is it diagnosed?

Patients are often diagnosed after they see a doctor because they — or a family member — are concerned they might be developing dementia, which is also more common as people age.

Memory loss, bladder control issues and trouble walking are also common. Patients can have trouble lifting their feet, putting them at risk for stumbling and falling.

Doctors often learn about normal pressure hydrocephalus and its three hallmark symptoms with this catchphrase: 'wet, wobbly and weird,' said Dr. Vikram Udani, a neurosurgeon in private practice in San Diego.

"The 'weird' is the cognitive issue, typically things like memory problems or confusion, and the 'wobbly' stands for gait instability," he said. "The 'wet' is the urinary incontinence."

Brain imaging, either a CT scan or an MRI, is generally used to look for the buildup of fluid, as well as a variety of neurological testing.

Doctors may also do what’s called a lumbar puncture to drain the excess fluid. If the person’s symptoms improve, the condition is often diagnosed as normal pressure hydrocephalus, or NPH.

Udani said no one knows what causes the condition, but added that it's highly unlikely that loud music or concert touring would trigger NPH.

How is it treated?

It can look like dementia, but there’s a key difference: normal pressure hydrocephalus is treatable and in many cases reversible if it’s caught early.

Commonly, neurosurgeons implant a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, or tube, into the brain that helps drain the fluid buildup into another part of the body, like the abdomen. The patient then essentially pees the excess fluid out, Udani said.

A drug called acetazolamide can also be used, as it may help the body decrease the level of fluid on its own. The medicine doesn’t work for everyone, Al-Holou said.

It was unclear Friday what kind of treatment Joel would receive. His social media post said that the singer “is undergoing specific physical therapy,” but did not give details.

That kind of therapy is usually given, doctors said, to help patients regain balance.

Any treatment is more effective if a diagnosis is made quickly. If the condition goes on too long unchecked, it could lead to permanent brain damage, Al-Holou said.

If a person seems to be experiencing early signs such as troublesome memory loss and difficulty walking, “they should see a primary care physician or neurologist to investigate further,” he said.

The White House on Thursday released its long-awaited “Make America Healthy Again” report, painting a dire picture of American children’s health. The lengthy federal assessment’s goal is to identify the root causes of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and neurodevelopmental disorders in children.

“Our kids are the sickest kids in the world,” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during a call with reporters Thursday morning.

Ultraprocessed food and environmental toxins were at the top of Kennedy’s list of problems that need to be urgently addressed to curb increases in chronic diseases during childhood. The report also cited sedentary, technology-driven lifestyles and the overprescribing of medications.

The 69-page report was heavy on outlining problems, but light on concrete solutions.

“The next stage of this process is to come up with policy recommendations for the president,” Kennedy said.

Trump commissioned the report in February in an executive order establishing the Make America Healthy Again Commission, a group of high-ranking federal officials tasked with reviewing research and making recommendations about chronic disease in children. The report echoes the priorities of Kennedy, who chairs the commission.

Kennedy said Thursday that the assessment will inform a follow-up report on policy recommendations to be released in the next 100 days. He added that there is “no budget” to support the initiative at this point, given that “there’s no concrete policy that could be funded in a budget.”

“I think everybody wants to prioritize the ultraprocessed food crisis” in those policy recommendations, he told NBC News on the call. Such foods have been linked to obesity, heart disease and cancer, but the strength and quality of these studies vary.

As health secretary, Kennedy has been outspoken about all four subjects highlighted in the report. In his first nearly 100 days in office, he announced that he was asking the food industry to phase out artificial dyes from the food supply and directed the Food and Drug Administration to revise a rule that allows food manufacturers to use additives that are “generally recognized as safe” without notifying the federal government. He also praised local efforts to restrict cellphone use in schools, ban fluoride in public water systems and prohibit the purchase of soda and energy drinks under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps.

Kennedy has also called attention to what he sees as serious health risks associated with pesticides — in particular, the weed killer glyphosate, which Kennedy has said is linked to a range of diseases, including cancer. The evidence itself is mixed.

While the MAHA report was widely anticipated to focus on pesticides, it instead highlights the “cumulative load of chemicals in the environment,” mentioning pesticides alongside other environmental exposures like PFAS, microplastics, fluoride, phthalates, bisphenols and electromagnetic radiation. Kennedy has made repeated, unsubstantiated claims that electromagnetic radiation from cell phones causes neurological damage and cancer in kids. The bulk of research so far has found no such association.

Many Republican lawmakers and members of the agricultural industry had expressed concern leading up to the report’s release that criticizing pesticide use could endanger farmers’ livelihoods and erode public trust in the food supply.

Kennedy told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday that he would not take any action to jeopardize the jobs of farmers who rely on glyphosate. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said on Thursday’s press call that the federal government will continue to regularly review the safety of pesticides but noted that abrupt changes in agricultural practices could adversely affect the domestic food supply.

While the MAHA report addresses some real issues, “the problem is that they need to come up with meaningful solutions,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.

The report offers some hints of where the MAHA Commission might choose to place its focus. For instance, it recommends that the National Institutes of Health fund long-term trials comparing the effects of eating whole foods, reducing carbohydrate intake and minimizing ultraprocessed foods on obesity and insulin resistance in children.

It also criticizes the current federal dietary guidelines for not explicitly addressing ultraprocessed foods, claiming the guidelines have “a history of being unduly influenced by corporate interests.” An independent advisory committee that evaluated the dietary guidelines under the Biden administration did not recommend any immediate changes for 2025 to 2030 to account for ultraprocessed foods.

The Trump administration is expected to release a new, updated version of the guidelines before the end of the year. Kennedy, whose department is overseeing the revision in tandem with the Department of Agriculture, has said that the new version will be scrubbed of influence by the food industry.

The MAHA report also recommends more research on the long-term health outcomes of commonly prescribed pediatric drugs. The report claims there are proven harms associated with overtreating children with antibiotics or medications for ADHD and depression, and “potentially major long-term repercussions” associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (a class of antidepressants), puberty blockers and GLP-1 agonists (the class of weight loss and diabetes drugs that includes Ozempic).

Benjamin said many of the suggested research areas in the report are already being studied, adding that the Trump administration’s massive cuts to NIH grants could be at odds with their goal.

“They keep saying that they want to do ‘gold standard research’ but they’ve cut funding from many of the nation’s leading academic centers,” he said.

The report made no mention of the leading cause of children’s deaths in the country: guns. Tobacco, the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., was not addressed in any measurable detail. Nearly all smokers start as kids.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters are predicting an active Atlantic hurricane season with more storm activity than typical.

“We’re really looking at an above normal season,” said Ken Graham, a meteorologist and the director of the National Weather Service. “We’re calling for 13 to 19 named storms.”

Storms get names when their wind speeds reach 39 mph or higher. Six to 10 of the forecasted storms are expected to become hurricanes, with wind speeds exceeding 74 mph. NOAA expects three to five major hurricanes — Category 3 and above.

The forecasts do not predict if or where the hurricanes will make landfall or how many of these storms will strike U.S. coastlines. Still, now is the time to prepare, forecasters said.

“It’s a good time to go out there and get your supplies and your kit and put it together,” Graham said. “We’ve got to be ready. No lines for supplies today. No lines for gas, no lines for plywood, no lines for water.”

Graham said the above-average forecast is driven in part by warmer ocean temperatures, a trend associated with climate change.

“The warmer ocean temperatures is really consistent with us being in a more active season,” Graham said at a news conference.

Forecasters were also predicting higher activity from the West African Monsoon, a pattern that develops storms off the shore of continental Africa and sends them spinning across the Atlantic and toward the U.S.

The hurricane forecast comes at a time when many National Weather Service offices are short on staff, after the Trump administration fired some workers and opened up voluntary retirement programs to cut staffing.

In the first months of 2025, nearly 600 staffers have left the National Weather Service, opening staffing holes. Still, the agency's leadership said the National Hurricane Center, a division of the National Weather Service, had the resources it needed.

“We are fully staffed at the hurricane center, and we definitely are ready to go. And we are really making this up a top priority for this administration,” said Laura Grimm, the acting administrator of NOAA.

The nation's 122 local forecasting offices have been hard hit and are riddled with vacancies. Many of those offices will be tasked with forecasting local effects after a hurricane landfall, such as flood inundation and rainfall.

"I'm going to make sure that our offices, when there's a hurricane threat, that's going to have the resources that they need to make sure every warning goes out," Graham said, adding that he was working on solutions to "make sure that we continue to have the staffing that we need long term."

Hurricane season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30. It typically starts to peak in late summer and early fall.

NOAA's forecast falls roughly in line with the public forecasts provided by outside research groups at universities, government agencies and private businesses.

On average, outside research groups predicted eight Atlantic hurricanes in 2025, according to a website operated by Colorado State University and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, which tracks and aggregates predictions each year.

Last year, NOAA predicted its highest-ever hurricane season. The season delivered 18 named storms and 11 hurricanes. Five hurricanes struck the U.S. coastline. Hurricane Helene made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast, then tracked northward with intense rainfall, causing destructive inland flooding in North Carolina, among other states. Helene killed more than 150 people.

Hurricane Milton made landfall as a Category 3 storm in Siesta Key Florida and produced 46 tornadoes.

Both storms underwent rapid intensification, a phenomenon in which hurricane winds ramp up suddenly as the storm nears shore.

Global warming makes that process more likely. High sea surface temperatures, like those observed over the past several years, can fuel that rapid intensification. A 2023 study found that tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean were about 29% more likely to undergo rapid intensification from 2001 to 2020, compared to 1971 to 1990.

To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.

Scientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papua New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.

Heat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.

Scientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that’s still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.

“We were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,” said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.

Though scientists don’t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It’s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.

Certain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.

Other animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Niño events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn’t yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.

“This is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,” said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.

The tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it’s not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.

Researchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to “catch up” and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.

“These natural systems really are under stress, but there’s a capacity for incredible resilience,” Versteeg said.

Privacy and digital rights advocates are raising alarms over a law that many would expect them to cheer: a federal crackdown on revenge porn and AI-generated deepfakes.

The newly signed Take It Down Act makes it illegal to publish nonconsensual explicit images — real or AI-generated — and gives platforms just 48 hours to comply with a victim’s takedown request or face liability. While widely praised as a long-overdue win for victims, experts have also warned its vague language, lax standards for verifying claims, and tight compliance window could pave the way for overreach, censorship of legitimate content, and even surveillance.

“Content moderation at scale is widely problematic and always ends up with important and necessary speech being censored,” India McKinney, director of federal affairs at Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization, told TechCrunch.

Online platforms have one year to establish a process for removing nonconsensual intimate imagery (NCII). While the law requires takedown requests come from victims or their representatives, it only asks for a physical or electronic signature — no photo ID or other form of verification is needed. That likely aims to reduce barriers for victims, but it could create an opportunity for abuse.

“I really want to be wrong about this, but I think there are going to be more requests to take down images depicting queer and trans people in relationships, and even more than that, I think it’s gonna be consensual porn,” McKinney said.

Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), a co-sponsor of the Take It Down Act, also sponsored the Kids Online Safety Act which puts the onus on platforms to protect children from harmful content online. Blackburn has said she believes content related to transgender people is harmful to kids. Similarly, the Heritage Foundation — the conservative think tank behind Project 2025 — has also said that “keeping trans content away from children is protecting kids.”

Because of the liability that platforms face if they don’t take down an image within 48 hours of receiving a request, “the default is going to be that they just take it down without doing any investigation to see if this actually is NCII or if it’s another type of protected speech, or if it’s even relevant to the person who’s making the request,” said McKinney.

Snapchat and Meta have both said they are supportive of the law, but neither responded to TechCrunch’s requests for more information about how they’ll verify whether the person requesting a takedown is a victim.

Mastodon, a decentralized platform that hosts its own flagship server that others can join, told TechCrunch it would lean towards removal if it was too difficult to verify the victim.

Mastodon and other decentralized platforms like Bluesky or Pixelfed may be especially vulnerable to the chilling effect of the 48-hour takedown rule. These networks rely on independently operated servers, often run by nonprofits or individuals. Under the law, the FTC can treat any platform that doesn’t “reasonably comply” with takedown demands as committing an “unfair or deceptive act or practice” – even if the host isn’t a commercial entity.

“This is troubling on its face, but it is particularly so at a moment when the chair of the FTC has taken unprecedented steps to politicize the agency and has explicitly promised to use the power of the agency to punish platforms and services on an ideological, as opposed to principled, basis,” the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to ending revenge porn, said in a statement.

Proactive monitoring

McKinney predicts that platforms will start moderating content before it’s disseminated so they have fewer problematic posts to take down in the future.

Platforms are already using AI to monitor for harmful content.

Kevin Guo, CEO and co-founder of AI-generated content detection startup Hive, said his company works with online platforms to detect deepfakes and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Some of Hive’s customers include Reddit, Giphy, Vevo, Bluesky, and BeReal.

“We were actually one of the tech companies that endorsed that bill,” Guo told TechCrunch. “It’ll help solve some pretty important problems and compel these platforms to adopt solutions more proactively.”

Hive’s model is a software-as-a-service, so the startup doesn’t control how platforms use its product to flag or remove content. But Guo said many clients insert Hive’s API at the point of upload to monitor before anything is sent out to the community.

A Reddit spokesperson told TechCrunch the platform uses “sophisticated internal tools, processes, and teams to address and remove” NCII. Reddit also partners with nonprofit SWGfl to deploy its StopNCII tool, which scans live traffic for matches against a database of known NCII and removes accurate matches. The company did not share how it would ensure the person requesting the takedown is the victim.

McKinney warns this kind of monitoring could extend into encrypted messages in the future. While the law focuses on public or semi-public dissemination, it also requires platforms to “remove and make reasonable efforts to prevent the reupload” of nonconsensual intimate images. She argues this could incentivize proactive scanning of all content, even in encrypted spaces. The law doesn’t include any carve outs for end-to-end encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, or iMessage.

Meta, Signal, and Apple have not responded to TechCrunch’s request for more information on their plans for encrypted messaging.

Broader free speech implications

On March 4, Trump delivered a joint address to Congress in which he praised the Take It Down Act and said he looked forward to signing it into law.

“And I’m going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don’t mind,” he added. “There’s nobody who gets treated worse than I do online.”

While the audience laughed at the comment, not everyone took it as a joke. Trump hasn’t been shy about suppressing or retaliating against unfavorable speech, whether that’s labeling mainstream media outlets “enemies of the people,” barring The Associated Press from the Oval Office despite a court order, or pulling funding from NPR and PBS.

On Thursday, the Trump administration barred Harvard University from accepting foreign student admissions, escalating a conflict that began after Harvard refused to adhere to Trump’s demands that it make changes to its curriculum and eliminate DEI-related content, among other things. In retaliation, Trump has frozen federal funding to Harvard and threatened to revoke the university’s tax-exempt status.

“At a time when we’re already seeing school boards try to ban books and we’re seeing certain politicians be very explicitly about the types of content they don’t want people to ever see, whether it’s critical race theory or abortion information or information about climate change…it is deeply uncomfortable for us with our past work on content moderation to see members of both parties openly advocating for content moderation at this scale,” McKinney said.

Welcome back to Week in Review! Tons of news from this week for you, including a hacking group that’s linked to the Spanish government; CEOs using AI avatars to deliver company earnings; Pocket shutting down — or is it?; and much more. Let’s get to it!

More than 10 years in the making: Kaspersky first revealed the existence of Careto in 2014, and at the time, its researchers called the group “one of the most advanced threats at the moment.” Kaspersky never publicly linked the hacking group to a specific government. But we’ve now learned that the researchers who first discovered the group were convinced that Spanish government hackers were behind Careto’s espionage operations.

23andWe: Regeneron announced this week that it’s buying genetic testing company 23andMe for $256 million, including the company’s genomics service and its bank of 15 million customers’ personal and genetic data. The pharma giant said it plans to use the customer data to help drug discovery, saying that it will “prioritize the privacy, security, and ethical use of 23andMe’s customer data.” Let’s hope so!

io, not I/O: OpenAI is acquiring io, the device startup that CEO Sam Altman has been working on with Jony Ive, in an all-equity deal that values that startup at $6.5 billion. Besides the fact that the announcement was accompanied by perhaps the strangest corporate headshot of all time, we spotted some other unexpected news: Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski’s family investment office, Flat Capital, had bought shares in io six months earlier, which means those io shares will be converted into shares in the for-profit arm of OpenAI. Not bad!

AI avatar contagion? Speaking of Klarna’s CEO, Siemiatkowski used an AI version of himself to deliver the company’s earnings this week. And he’s not the only one! Zoom CEO Eric Yuan followed suit, also using his avatar for initial comments. Cool?

Out of Pocket: Mozilla is shutting down Pocket, the beloved read-it-later app, on July 8. The company didn’t say why it’s shutting Pocket down, only that it will continue to invest in helping people discover and “access high quality web content.” But maybe it can be saved: Soon after, Digg founder Kevin Rose posted on X that his company would love to buy it. Web 2.0 is back, baby.

AI on my face: Apple is reportedly working on AI-powered glasses, similar to Meta’s Ray-Bans, sometime next year. They’ll have a camera and microphone and will work with Siri. Sure, why not?

Uh, no thank you: At its very first developer conference, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, which can analyze large datasets, execute long-horizon tasks, and take complex actions, according to the company. That’s all fine and good until I learned the Claude Opus 4 model tried to blackmail developers when they threaten to replace it with a new AI system. The model also gives sensitive information about the engineers responsible for the decision.

Ah, now I feel better: But don’t worry! Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that today’s AI models hallucinate at a lower rate than humans do. That might be true, but at least humans don’t immediately turn to blackmail when they don’t like what they hear.

Bluesky blue checks: The decentralized social network Bluesky quietly rolled out blue verification badges for “notable and authentic” accounts. People can now apply for verification through a new online form. But Bluesky is leaning on other systems beyond the blue badge to verify users.

Google’s new look: For what seems like 100 years, Google hasn’t changed much. Sure there are ads and boxes and now AI summaries that, for better or worse, get you to the right answers — usually. But the premise has always been the same: Type your query into a box, and Google will surface results.

At this year’s Google I/O, we started noticing a change. As Maxwell Zeff, writes, “At I/O 2025, Google made clear that the concept of Search is firmly in its rearview mirror.” The largest announcement of I/O was that Google now offers AI mode to every Search user in the United States, which means users can have an AI agent search (or even purchase things) for them.

Naukri.com, a popular Indian employment website, has fixed a bug that exposed the email addresses of recruiters using its platform to search and hire talent online.

The issue, discovered by security researcher Lohith Gowda, affected the API that Naukri used on its Android and iOS apps. The API exposed the email addresses of recruiters visiting profiles of potential candidates on Naukri’s platform. The issue did not appear to affect the company’s website.

“The exposed recruiter email IDs can be used for targeted phishing attacks, and recruiters may receive excessive unsolicited emails and spam,” Gowda told TechCrunch.

He added that exposed email IDs could be added to public breach databases or spam lists, and mass email address scraping could lead to automated bot abuse or scams.

TechCrunch verified the exposure after the researcher shared details about the bug. The researcher confirmed to TechCrunch that the issue was fixed earlier this week, which Naukri corroborated on Friday.

“All identified enhancements are implemented, ensuring our systems remain updated and resilient,” Alok Vij, IT infrastructure head at Naukri’s parent company InfoEdge, told TechCrunch over email. “Our teams have not detected any usual activity that affects the integrity of user data.”

Founded in March 1997, Naukri.com is India’s top classified recruitment website, helping connect recruiters, employers, and job seekers. Apart from India, the site exists in the Middle East as Naukrigulf.com.

“Certain features of our recruiter profiles are designed to be public to enable users to know who has access to their profile(s). We conduct regular audits and security assessments,” said Vij.

Venture capitalists have always focused on investing in companies that leverage technology to either disrupt established industries or create entirely new business categories.

But some VCs are starting to flip the script on their investing styles. Rather than funding startups, they are acquiring mature businesses — such as call centers, accounting firms, and other professional service firms —and optimizing them with artificial intelligence to serve more customers through automation.

This strategy, often likened to private equity roll-ups, is being employed by firms such as General Catalyst, Thrive Capital, and solo VC Elad Gil. General Catalyst, touting this as a new asset class, has already backed seven such companies, including Long Lake, a startup that scoops up homeowners associations in an effort to make the management of communities more streamlined. Since its founding less than two years ago, Long Lake has secured $670 million in funding, according to PitchBook data.

While the strategy is still new, a few other venture outfits have told TechCrunch that they are also considering trying out the investment model.

Among them is Khosla Ventures, a firm known for making early bets on risky, unproven technologies with long development timelines.

“I think we’ll look at a few of these types of opportunities,” Samir Kaul, general partner at Khosla Ventures, told TechCrunch.

Interestingly, this PE-flavored approach could be a surprising benefit to the multitudes of AI startups VCs are backing. If a VC marries old businesses with new technology, AI startups wanting to serve these industries would essentially gain instant access to large, established clients.

According to Kaul, such access would be helpful when new startups have difficulties securing customers on their own. With the rapid rate of change in AI, the number of startups pouring into the market, and the historically long sales cycles involved in selling to enterprises, such difficulties apply to many AI startups.

But Khosla Ventures wants to proceed with caution. “The companies we’re looking at are very unlikely to lose money,” Kaul said, but he doesn’t want the strategy to ruin the firm’s strong return track record. “My biggest stress in life is I’m managing other people’s money, and I want to make sure that I continue to be a good steward of it.”

While Khosla Ventures is starting to “dabble” in AI roll-up investments, Kaul explained that the firm wants to do a few deals to assess if such investments deliver strong returns for the firm before possibly raising money for some kind of vehicle specifically aimed at this investment strategy.

If early bets pan out, Khosla would likely partner with a PE-style firm to help it with acquisitions rather than hire a team. “We wouldn’t do it alone, we don’t have that expertise,” he said.

Amazon-owned autonomous vehicle company Zoox has issued its second voluntary software recall in a month, following a collision between one of its robotaxis and an e-scooter rider in San Francisco on May 8.

The latest incident involved an unoccupied Zoox vehicle operating at low speed, which the company says was struck by the e-scooter after braking to yield at an intersection.

Just weeks earlier, the company recalled about 270 vehicles after a Las Vegas crash between a Zoox robotaxi and a passenger car that raised concerns over the self-driving software’s ability to predict the movement of other road users.

That issue still seems to be a concern.

“The Zoox vehicle was stopped at the time of contact,” the company’s statement on the May 8 crash reads. “The e-scooterist fell to the ground directly next to the vehicle. The robotaxi then began to move and stopped after completing the turn, but did not make further contact with the e-scooterist.”

The e-scooterist declined an offer of medical attention for minor injuries, according to Zoox.

Zoox said it shared relevant information and video with regulators, and has already issued a software update to “improve perception tracking and further prevent vehicle movement when a vulnerable road user may be very near the vehicle.”

A robotaxi that continues to move after a collision could risk harming other road users that were involved in the crash. Just look at what happened to Cruise, Zoox’s erstwhile competitor. The GM-backed company saw its business crumble after one of its robotaxis struck a pedestrian that was flung into its path by a human-driven vehicle, and then dragged that pedestrian some 20 feet while attempting a pullover maneuver.

TechCrunch has reached out to learn if this was a top-of-mind concern for Zoox when it issued its software recall, or whether there were other factors at play, like unexpected hard braking.

In March, Zoox recalled 258 vehicles due to issues with its autonomous driving system that could cause unexpected hard braking, following two reports of incidents in which motorcyclists collided into the back of Zoox test vehicles.

Zoox did not respond in time to TechCrunch to confirm more details about its latest software recall, including how many vehicles were affected, and how this update is different from the update issued several weeks ago.

TechCrunch has reached out to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for more information on the recall.

The idea of becoming a real estate investor for as little as $5 may seem too good to be true.

And for many users of Landa, a proptech company that promised just that — it has been.

Landa emerged from stealth in August 2022, announcing a total of $33 million in funding and a pledge to help everyday Americans access residential real estate investment through fractional shares.

CEO Yishai Cohen and former CTO Amit Assaraf founded Landa in 2019 in an effort to make real estate investment more inclusive. The app’s only requirements were that users be over age 18 and U.S. residents. They could start investing with just $5, and buy and sell shares as well as see real-time updates on their properties from the Landa app. (Assaraf left the company in December of 2023, according to his LinkedIn profile. He has not responded to requests for comment.)

Today, Landa’s investment portal site is down and its app is inoperable. Users claim they can’t access their funds and haven’t been paid dividends in months. The startup is embroiled in litigation, including a lawsuit from its early venture investor Viola.

One early user told TechCrunch that Landa stopped paying dividends to him on his shares in January. When he asked Landa about it, they “punted the question,” he said.

“I repeatedly emailed them about it and just got deflecting answers, nothing real,” the user said. “Then a few months after that, the app became unusable. It would not open.”

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW

The user then asked if he could delete his account, which he had opened in 2021, and sell the shares. But he found Landa had disabled his ability to sell shares.

“They have essentially frozen me out of my funds and just shut down the app,” the user said. “Where is the money? Why won’t they return it to me?”

Over 130 complaints have been filed against Landa to the Better Business Bureau, with dozens of people echoing similar allegations. For instance, on May 1, one user who filed such a complaint shared they had invested over $8,000 through Landa and stopped receiving dividends last fall. The user said Landa customer service replied to their emails by saying that the company is “working on it.”

In mid-April, when TechCrunch asked Landa about the issue — including the status of its downed site and whether the company itself had shut down — CEO Cohen said: “Of course not. The site will be back up.”

When asked why the app was not working and why users had not received dividends in months, Cohen’s terse reply still seemed to refer to the website, blaming the servers: “It’s unrelated to dividends. It’s from our servers. We are on it.”

Upon further prodding, Cohen on April 18 shared the following statement: “We are aware of the issues currently affecting our platform and product, and want to assure all investors that we are actively working to restore full functionality as soon as possible. We have kept investors informed through all updates, including the server access issue. We appreciate the continued support of our investors and resident community, and remain committed to delivering on our vision of making real estate investing accessible to everyone.”

Cohen did not respond to our request for a status update on May 20. Investors NFX and 83North did not respond to our multiple requests for comment.

Embroiled in a lawsuit

It’s not just users who are upset with Landa. The company’s primary lenders are suing.

Viola Credit and L Finance filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court against Landa in November 2024, accusing it of “numerous defaults” on more than $35 million worth of loans they extended to the company. (Viola is also an investor in Landa through its venture division.)

The lenders also accused it of missing property tax payments that led to the forced sale of those properties, neglecting properties, and even failing to collect rents.

The lawsuit — first reported by real estate industry publication Bisnow — states that after over a year of attempting to get Landa to honor their commitments, the lenders removed Landa as manager of the homes and appointed an independent property manager and a chief restructuring officer.

After further negotiations failed, the creditors later asked the court for, and were granted, an injunction blocking Landa from accessing bank accounts, interfering with their attempts to restructure the business, and reclaiming money they say is owed — including proceeds from property sales.

Despite the injunction, the lenders returned to court in January 2025, claiming Landa told tenants to send rent payments to a different bank account not covered by the ruling. They discovered this while making repairs to one property’s septic system. They also accused Landa’s CEO of trying to sell or refinance some properties.

The court ordered Landa to explain itself. Instead, in early March, Landa asked the court for a restraining order against Viola Credit and L Finance, claiming the independent manager was “installed unlawfully.”

Judge Jennifer G. Schecter was not pleased. In March, she ordered both sides to find a solution “that’s good for all of your clients.” She denied Landa’s request for an injunction and ordered the company to pay nearly $100,000. A few weeks later, Landa filed a formal countersuit. The case is still pending.

Challenging model

Landa is just one of several startups that emerged in recent years offering fractional real estate investing. It is also apparently not the only one that has struggled — especially after mortgage interest rates began soaring in 2022.

Fintor raised millions of dollars before seemingly pivoting to offer an “AI Agent to automate finance and real estate operations with human level performance.” Dallas-based Nada, which offered index-like real estate investment products called “Cityfunds,” allowing non-accredited investors to buy into a city’s home equity market with as little as $250, also appears to have pivoted. Its website now promotes a new tagline: “Access home equity to finance anything.”

Arrived was perhaps the highest-profile of the bunch — and the only one that seems to be actively operating under the same model. In May of 2022, TechCrunch reported that Arrived raised $25 million in a Series A funding round including Bezos Expeditions, to allow people to buy shares in single-family rentals with “as little as $100.” According to its website, the startup has to date paid out over $13 million in dividends and interest and has 766,000 registered investors.

As for those people who invested with Landa, the future of their money appears uncertain. As of May 23, Landa’s investor portal website still redirects to a “come-back-soon” maintenance message.

Mistral AI, the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is officially regarded as one of France’s most promising tech startups and is arguably the only European company that could compete with OpenAI. But compared to its $6 billion valuation, its global market share is still relatively low.

However, the recent launch of its chat assistant on mobile app stores was met with some hype, particularly in its home country. “Go and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI — or something else,” French president Emmanuel Macron said in a TV interview ahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris.

While this wave of attention may be encouraging, Mistral AI still faces challenges in competing with the likes of OpenAI — and in doing so while keeping up with its self-definition as “the world’s greenest and leading independent AI lab.”

What is Mistral AI?

Mistral AI has raised significant amounts of funding since its creation in 2023 with the ambition to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone.” While this isn’t a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company’s advocacy for openness in AI.

Its alternative to ChatGPT, chat assistant Le Chat, is now also available on iOS and Android. It reached 1 million downloads in the two weeks following its mobile release, even grabbing France’s top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store.

This comes in addition to Mistral AI’s suite of models, which includes:

In March 2025, the company introduced Mistral OCR, an optical character recognition (OCR) API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest.

Who are Mistral AI’s founders?

Mistral AI’s three founders share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google’s DeepMind, while CTO Timothée Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers.

Co-founding advisers also include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve (also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister Cédric O, which caused controversy due to his previous role.

Are Mistral AI’s models open source?

Not all of them. Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whose weights are not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license.

Free models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startup open sourced in July 2024.

How does Mistral AI make money?

While many of Mistral AI’s offerings are free or now have free tiers, Mistral AI plans to drive some revenue from Le Chat’s paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat’s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month.

On the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlighted during the Paris AI Summit.

Overall, however, Mistral AI’s revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources.

What partnerships has Mistral AI closed?

In 2024, Mistral AI entered a deal with Microsoft that included a strategic partnership for distributing its AI models through Microsoft’s Azure platform and a €15 million investment. The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) swiftly concluded that the deal didn’t qualify for investigation due to its small size. However, it also sparked some criticism in the EU.

In January 2025, Mistral AI signed a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) to let Chat query the AFP’s entire text archive dating back to 1983.

Mistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France’s army and job agency, shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis.

In May 2025, Mistral AI announced it would participate in the creation of an AI Campus in the Paris region, as part of a joint venture with UAE-investment firm MGX, NVIDIA, and France’s state-owned investment bank Bpifrance.

As of February 2025, Mistral AI raised around €1 billion in capital to date, approximately $1.04 billion at the current exchange rate. This includes some debt financing, as well as several equity financing rounds raised in close succession.

In June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised a record $112 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round — Europe’s largest ever — valued the then-one-month-old startup at $260 million.

Other investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saadé, Sofina, and Xavier Niel.

Only six months later, it closed a Series A of €385 million ($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce.

The $16.3 million convertible investment that Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation.

In June 2024, Mistral AI then raised €600 million in a mix of equity and debt (around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). The long-rumored round was led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others.

What could a Mistral AI exit look like?

Mistral is “not for sale,” Mensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Of course, [an IPO is] the plan.”

This makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer.

However, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its nearly $6 billion valuation. Either way, stay tuned.

Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly called Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to make changes to or veto a newly passed law in the state that would require the company to verify the ages of device owners, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Abbott has yet to sign the bill. But Apple, alongside Google, has been working with interest groups to fight the legislation. Apple in particular argues that the implementation of the Texas bill could pose a threat to user privacy.

The bill would mandate that if a minor uses a device, their App Store account be tied to their parents’, so that parents are notified of minors’ app downloads and prompted to approve or deny them.

“If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it’s an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,” an Apple spokesperson told the WSJ.

Those in support of the bill say it will allow parents to exercise more control over the relationship between children and their smartphones.

At least nine other states are looking at similar legislation. Apple managed to stop a bill from passing in Louisiana last year, although the state is now revisiting the bill.

Kesha may have taken the dollar sign out of her name, but now, the singer is thinking about money again — not for herself, but to fund the seed round of her new startup, Smash.

According to Kesha’s Instagram post, Smash will be a “community-based platform to connect and protect music creators,” which aligns with the mission of her new eponymous record label, which she announced last year.

The 38-year-old chart-topper has always been more than a glitter-clad party girl singing about brushing her teeth with Jack Daniel’s. Beneath her infectious 2010s pop music is a darker story — one in which she felt stripped of her power, both as an artist and a person, by a predatory record deal that she signed when she was a teenager.

After a traumatic public legal battle with her producer, Kesha now says that she is a “free woman,” and she’s making new music. Both her label, Kesha Records, and the app Smash seek to help others make music without compromising their creative rights.

“I want a place where artists and music makers of any kind can have community, they can collaborate, they can hire each other and retain all the rights to everything they create,” Kesha said in an interview with WIRED. “There’s no gatekeeping of contacts.”

She went on to describe the app as “LinkedIn for music creators,” or a “Fiverr-style marketplace.” The difference is that Smash plans to prioritize artists’ rights at every stage.

Kesha’s CTO on the project is Alan Cannistraro. He spent 12 years at Apple building some of the first iOS apps, then worked at Facebook, where he built the Year-In-Review feature. He left to start a social video platform called Rheo, which TechCrunch covered in 2016.

Last week, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok experienced a “bug” that made it tell users about the “white genocide” conspiracy theory in South Africa, even when prompted with questions that had nothing to do with the topic … and soon after, Grok expressed skepticism over the Holocaust death toll, which it chalked up to a “programming error.”

But with a degree of mental gymnastics that could put Simone Biles to shame, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has decided that Elon Musk’s robot baby Grok is too far left.

Image Credits:Twitter/X (screenshot)

“Grok is left leaning and continues to spread fake news and propaganda,” Greene wrote on X.

She shared a screenshot in which Grok says that Greene is a Christian who has expressed her belief in Jesus, but concedes that some Christians are troubled by her support for conspiracy theories like QAnon.

“Critics, including religious leaders, argue her actions contradict Christian values of love and unity, citing her defense of January 6 and divisive rhetoric,” Grok wrote in the screenshot Greene shared.

X was already having a particularly challenging day — the app has been experiencing outages for hours, which could possibly be related to fires that broke out in its Oregon data center yesterday.

But while Greene may be a known peddler of harmful misinformation and conspiracies, she did actually make a great point in the end: “When people give up their own discernment, stop seeking the truth, and depend on AI to analyze information, they will be lost,” she said on X.

Luminar, the lidar startup turned SPAC, appears to be grasping for capital. Why else would the company make a deal with Yorkville Advisors Global that could bring another $200 million into its coffers through the sale of convertible preferred stock over an 18-month period?



Under the terms, Luminar will issue $35 million in convertible preferred stock to the investors. Luminar may issue additional tranches in amounts of up to $35 million no more than every 60 days at a purchase price equal to 96% of the stated value of the convertible preferred stock.

You might recall Luminar’s board recently replaced founder Austin Russell as its CEO. The company is also going through another restructuring — its third in a year.

SparkCharge, which offers what it calls “charging-as-a-service” for fleets, raised $15.5 million in a Series A-1 round led by Monte’s Fam, with participation from Cleveland Avenue, Collab Capital, Elemental Impact, MarcyPen, and non sibi ventures. Alongside the equity round, SparkCharge also secured a $15 million venture loan from Horizon Technology Finance Corp.

Sylndr, a Cairo-based online used car sales startup that is expanding into auto financing, servicing, and tools for dealers, raised $15.7 million. The round was led by Development Partners International’s Nclude Fund. The startup also raised nearly $10 million in debt financing from local banks in the past year.

Is an auction a deal? Perhaps for someone. Nikola’s hydrogen trucks, which have a value of about $114 million, are up for auction — one of the company’s last steps in unloading all of its assets after filing for bankruptcy in February.

Autonomous vehicles

Aurora has put human “observers” in its self-driving trucks at the request of its partner PACCAR, a disclosure that has some scratching their heads about the move. To be clear, these “observers” are not human safety operators, meaning they can’t intervene. An Aurora spokesperson confirmed and noted they have a different role than the human safety operators in the company’s supervised hauls.

This news prompted folks to send me a slew of messages with questions like “Why?” and “What’s the point?”

Einride founder Robert Falck is stepping down from the role of CEO. Einride’s CFO, Roozbeh Charli, will take over the role of chief executive effective immediately.

Reliable Robotics, the autonomous aviation company, appointed Marc Stoll as its new CFO. Stoll is the former VP of Finance at Apple and partner at Eclipse Ventures.

Zoox has completed the “initial mapping phase” and will begin testing its self-driving vehicles in Atlanta later this summer.

The California Public Utilities Commission approved Waymo’s request to expand its commercial robotaxi service area into more communities south of San Francisco. Meanwhile, Waymo and Uber plan to start offering robotaxi rides in Atlanta to select customers who signed onto a waitlist earlier this year.

Tesla plans to limit where its robotaxis operate in Austin, Texas, to specific areas the company deems “the safest,” according to Elon Musk. Using a geofence represents a major strategy shift for Musk, who spent years claiming his company would be able to create a general-purpose self-driving solution that could be dropped into any location and work without human supervision.

Yup, “This week’s wheels” is back with Rebecca Bellan, who writes about her time on the new Heybike Alpha, a sturdy, fat-tire, all-terrain e-bike with a $1,699 price tag.

The entire review can be read here.

For those who want the highlights: The Alpha ticked a lot of boxes for Bellan — notably the mid-drive motor with torque sensor and long-lasting battery. There were some frustrations, though, too. Putting the bike together, the app, and outsized horn were disappointments. But generally, Rebecca felt the Alpha was an excellent all-around e-bike, whether you want to take it on off-road adventures or use it in the city to do your weekly Trader Joe’s shopping.

OpenAI is updating the AI model powering Operator, its AI agent that can autonomously browse the web and use certain software within a cloud-hosted virtual machine to fulfill users’ requests.

Soon, Operator will use a model based on o3, one of the latest in OpenAI’s o series of “reasoning” models. Previously, Operator relied on a custom version of GPT-4o.

By many benchmarks, o3 is a far more advanced model, particularly on tasks involving math and reasoning.

“We are replacing the existing GPT‑4o-based model for Operator with a version based on OpenAI o3,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “The API version [of Operator] will remain based on 4o.”

Operator is one among many agentic tools released by AI companies in recent months. Companies are racing to make highly sophisticated agents that can reliably carry out chores more or less without supervision.

Google offers a “computer use” agent through its Gemini API that can similarly browse the web and take actions on behalf of users, as well as a more consumer-focused offering called Mariner. Anthropic’s models are also able to perform computer tasks, including opening files and navigating web pages.

According to OpenAI, the new Operator model, called o3 Operator, was “fine-tuned with additional safety data for computer use,” including datasets designed to “teach the model [OpenAI’s] decision boundaries on confirmations and refusals.”

OpenAI has released a technical report showing o3 Operator’s performance on specific safety evaluations. Compared to the GPT-4o Operator model, o3 Operator is less likely to refuse to perform “illicit” activities and search for sensitive personal data, and less susceptible to a form of AI attack known as prompt injection, per the technical report.

“o3 Operator uses the same multi-layered approach to safety that we used for the 4o version of Operator,” OpenAI wrote in its blog post. “Although o3 Operator inherits o3’s coding capabilities, it does not have native access to a coding environment or terminal.”

At a TechCrunch StrictlyVC event in London, Accel general partner Sonali ​​De Rycker said she was bullish about Europe’s prospects in AI but wary of regulatory overreach. “We’re in a supercycle,” she said. “These cycles don’t come often, and we can’t afford to be leashed.”

One of Microsoft’s latest AI models can accurately predict air quality, hurricanes, typhoons, and other weather-related phenomena, the company claims.

In a paper published in the journal Nature and an accompanying blog post this week, Microsoft detailed Aurora, which the tech giant says can forecast atmospheric events with greater precision and speed than traditional meteorological approaches. Aurora, which has been trained on more than a million hours of data from satellites, radar and weather stations, simulations, and forecasts, can be fine-tuned with additional data to make predictions for particular weather events.

AI weather models are nothing new. Google DeepMind has released a handful over the past several years, including WeatherNext, which the lab claims beats some of the world’s best forecasting systems. Microsoft is positioning Aurora as one of the field’s top performers — and a potential boon for labs studying weather science.

In experiments, Aurora predicted Typhoon Doksuri’s landfall in the Philippines four days in advance of the actual event, beating some expert predictions, Microsoft says. The model also bested the National Hurricane Center in forecasting five-day tropical cyclone tracks for the 2022-2023 season, and successfully predicted the 2022 Iraq sandstorm.

While Aurora required substantial computing infrastructure to train, Microsoft says the model is highly efficient to run. It generates forecasts in seconds compared to the hours traditional systems take using supercomputer hardware.

Microsoft, which has made the source code and model weights publicly available, says that it’s incorporating Aurora’s AI modeling into its MSN Weather app via a specialized version of the model that produces hourly forecasts, including for clouds.

In Brief

Discord is entering its second decade as a company and is seeking to go public. Along the way, it’s changed the way that online communities interact, turning groups that may have previously existed as forums or message boards into multi-channel instant message servers. Now, everything finds a home on Discord, whether it’s an AI platform like Midjourney (Discord’s largest server), an international gaming community, or a school club.

But message boards still serve their purpose. Sometimes, there’s value in more incremental, organized commentary in a forum, as opposed to the rapidity of real-time, casual chats on Discord, which can flood users with an overwhelming number of unread messages and potentially obscure the most useful information.

According to The Verge, Discord’s SVP of product, Peter Sellis, says that the company is thinking about how to solve this issue. He said that Discord wants to work on features that are “more amicable to structured knowledge sharing, like forums, that we could probably do a better job of investing in.”

Another proposed solution to this clutter is to use an LLM to summarize long streams of messages. But culture among Discord users varies so widely that the embrace of AI could simultaneously excite and enrage its audience.

With LLMs, Sellis said, Discord could take a long, meandering conversation and turn it into “something that could be more sharable and syndicated across the web.” However, he said that he and his team hadn’t “seen a solution that we feel great about yet.”

With a new CEO at its helm and an imminent IPO, Discord is probably in for more than a few updates.

OpenAI just made its biggest acquisition yet, scooping up Jony Ive and Sam Altman’s secretive device startup, io, in a $6.5 billion all-equity deal. Ive, the legendary designer behind the iPhone and other iconic Apple products, will now lead creative and design work at OpenAI through his firm LoveFrom. The goal? To take AI “beyond the screen” and build a new generation of AI-powered consumer devices.

Beyond the tech, there’s a clear narrative play here. OpenAI is framing Altman as the Jobs-esque visionary and Ive as the design genius who makes it all real. Social media had a field day with the staged buddy shots of the duo, but the messaging is hard to miss: Take the iPhone launch, and make it AI.

Today, on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, hosts Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha unpack the deal, dive into AI wearables, and discuss more of this week’s tech headlines.

Digg, the Web 2.0-era link aggregator that’s now being given a second chance at life, is open to buying Mozilla’s read-it-later app, Pocket.

On Thursday, Mozilla announced it would shut down Pocket on July 8, saying that the way people use the web has evolved, and it needed to focus on new areas of development. Shortly after, Kevin Rose, Digg’s original owner, now co-founder of the new Digg alongside Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, posted on X that his company would be interested in acquiring Pocket from Mozilla.

Tagging both Mozilla and Pocket on the post, Rose wrote, “we love Pocket at @Digg, happy to take it over and continue to support your users for years to come!” The post additionally tagged Betaworks founding partner Peter Rojas, previously the founder of Gizmodo and Engadget, now SVP New Products at Mozilla.

.@mozilla @Pocket — we love Pocket at @digg, happy to take it over and continue to support your users for years to come! cc: @peterrojas :) — Kevin Rose (@kevinrose) May 22, 2025

Neither Digg nor Mozilla has yet to respond to a request for comment on the news. However, the deal could be interesting if it went through, as Digg could leverage Pocket’s existing user base to fuel interest in its relaunch. Digg could potentially even integrate Pocket’s reading list with Digg, making it easier for users to find and share engaging content directly to the news aggregator. This could provide an initial pipeline for feeding news and articles into Digg while it worked to grow its user base.

Digg’s comeback has attracted attention, as it pairs Digg’s original founder, Rose, with Ohanian, who helped create the longtime Digg competitor, Reddit, now an internet giant of its own. Digg recently announced it has also brought on Christian Selig, the founder of the third-party Reddit app Apollo, as an adviser. Selig’s Apollo app had been one of the best ways to interact with Reddit, but the company cut off the app’s access by raising its API pricing to the point that it would have put Selig out of business.

Digg isn’t the only one to have gone after Pocket. Medium CEO Tony Stubbleine says he also explored buying Pocket in 2023, but never heard from Mozilla before it announced it was shutting the app down.

“Not sure what Mozilla is doing, but it is kind of infuriating,” Stubbleine told TechCrunch. “The Pocket software is easy to rebuild, but some of the infrastructure and integrations around the web would be hard to replace. So I’m sure that someone would have taken it on.”

Updated after publication with comment from Stubbleine.

ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI’s products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company’s expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.

OpenAI promises to make changes to prevent future ChatGPT sycophancy

OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.

April 2025

OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable

OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.

OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations

An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”

ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping

OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.

OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance

OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market

OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models

OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step — sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”

OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark

Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.

OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks

OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.

OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks

OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.

OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini

OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.

OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers

Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.

All of your image creations, all in one place.



Introducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations—rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile and https://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg. pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj — OpenAI (@OpenAI) April 15, 2025

OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI

OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.

OpenAI is building its own social media network

OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.

OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July

OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.

OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities

OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.

OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April

OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.

OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon

OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.

OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT

It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”

OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students

OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.

ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images so far

More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.

OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate

The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.

OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays

In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote.

March 2025

OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model

OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.

OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation

OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.

OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data

OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said.

OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns

The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.

OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year

OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said.

ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature

OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.

OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature

OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.

OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India

OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.

OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations

Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”

OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models

OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.

OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1

OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.



PROMPT:



Please write a metafictional literary short story… — Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025

OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’

OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

ChatGPT can directly edit your code

The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.

ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases

According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.

OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.

ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed

A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

January 2025

OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.

OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model

OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.

OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan

Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.

OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks

ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.

FAQs:

What companies use ChatGPT?

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Can ChatGPT write essays?

Yes.

Can ChatGPT commit libel?

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Does ChatGPT have an app?

Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.

What is the ChatGPT character limit?

It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Does ChatGPT have an API?

Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.

What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?

Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

How good is ChatGPT at writing code?

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.

Can you save a ChatGPT chat?

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.

How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?

Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.

Can ChatGPT be detected?

Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.

Are ChatGPT chats public?

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.

What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?

Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

California is preparing to sue the federal government to recover its right to set vehicle emissions standards, Rob Bonta, the state’s attorney general, told TechCrunch in a statement.

Senate Republicans voted on Thursday 51 to 44 to overturn a waiver that allowed California to set stricter air pollution standards for vehicles. The state has received waivers more than 100 times since federal laws granted the right some 50 years ago.

“The weaponization of the Congressional Review Act to attack California’s waivers is just another part of the continuous, partisan campaign against California’s efforts to protect the public and the planet from harmful pollution,” Bonta said. “As we have said before, this reckless misuse of the Congressional Review Act is unlawful, and California will not stand idly by.”

Sixteen other states and the District of Columbia follow California’s emissions standards, and most of them have implemented fossil fuel vehicle phase-outs. Other Senate votes Thursday repealed waivers that allowed California to set stricter emissions standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.

California’s EV mandate is actually a zero-emissions standard. Beginning in 2026, the state was to begin requiring increased sales of zero-emissions cars and passenger trucks until 2035, when automakers would have to sell only zero-emissions vehicles.

Currently, two technologies qualify: hydrogen fuel cells and battery electric vehicles. Given the growing pains that fuel cells and hydrogen filling networks have experienced, EVs quickly became the de facto approach to meeting California’s 2035 deadline.

Last year, 25.3% of new light-duty vehicles in California qualified as zero emissions, and nearly all of them were EVs. The state’s mandate required 35% of new sales to be ZEV in 2026, something automakers have said would be “impossible.”

ZEV sales growth in California was flat in 2024, though previous years were different, with the share rising from 7.8% in 2020 to 25% in 2023.

The vote Thursday bucked precedent by going against the advice of the Senate parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office, which both had ruled that the waiver could not be revoked under the Congressional Review Act. The CRA allows a simple majority vote on a resolution to overturn a regulation, allowing a Senate vote to proceed without threat of filibuster.

Previously, California’s attorney general Rob Bonta was “prepared for” Republican efforts to repeal the emissions waiver via the CRA. “We don’t think it’s an appropriate use of the Congressional Review Act, and we’re prepared to defend ourselves if it’s wrongfully weaponized,” he told Politico in early March.

Updated 7:37 a.m. Pacific: Added news of California preparing a lawsuit against the federal government.

As generative AI becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing, the ethical stakes are no longer theoretical. What happens when the tools to deceive become widely accessible? And how do we build systems that are powerful — but safe enough to trust?

At TechCrunch Sessions: AI, taking place June 5 at UC Berkeley’s Zellerbach Hall, Artemis Seaford, Head of AI Safety at ElevenLabs, and Ion Stoica, co-founder of Databricks and professor at UC Berkeley, will take the main stage to unpack the ethical challenges of today’s AI. Their conversation will cut to the heart of one of the most urgent questions in tech: What are we unleashing — and can we still steer it?

How Seaford and Stoica are tackling AI’s toughest ethical questions

Artemis brings a rare blend of academic depth and frontline experience. At ElevenLabs, she leads AI safety efforts focused on media authenticity and abuse prevention. Her background spans OpenAI, Meta, and global risk management at the intersection of law, policy, and geopolitics. Expect a grounded, clear-eyed take on how deepfakes are evolving, what new risks are emerging, and which interventions are actually working.

Ion, meanwhile, brings a systems-level view. He’s not just a leader in AI research—he’s helped build the infrastructure behind it. From Spark to Ray to ChatBot Arena, his open source projects power many of today’s most advanced AI deployments. As executive chairman of Databricks and a founder of several AI-driven companies, Ion knows what it takes to scale responsibly — and where today’s tools still fall short.

Together, they’ll unpack the ethical blind spots in today’s development cycles, explore how safety can be embedded into core architectures, and examine the roles that industry, academia, and regulation must play in the years ahead.

Anthropic agrees with the U.S. government that implementing robust export controls on domestically made AI chips will help the U.S. compete in the AI race against China. But the company is suggesting a few tweaks to the proposed restrictions.

Anthropic released a blog post on Wednesday stating that the company “strongly supports” the U.S. Department of Commerce’s “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” ahead of the interim rule’s implementation date on May 15.

The framework was proposed by outgoing president Joe Biden in January and is meant to bolster AI chip export controls for the purposes of national security and to ensure the U.S.’ dominance in AI. It divided the world’s countries into three tiers, with each tier having its own guidelines and restrictions.

Tier 3, the most restrictive tier, which includes countries that were already impacted by existing export controls, like Russia and China, would face additional restrictions. Tier 2 countries, like Mexico and Portugal, would come under export restrictions for the first time and would have a cap on how many chips they could buy. Tier 1 countries, like Japan and South Korea, would continue without export restrictions.

When these restrictions were proposed in January, semiconductor giant Nvidia released a statement calling them “unprecedented and misguided,” and suggesting that they would “derail” innovation worldwide.

Clearly, U.S.-based AI companies, like Anthropic, don’t agree. In its blog post, the lab expressed support in broad strokes for the restrictions.

Anthropic did, however, propose lowering the number of chips Tier 2 countries can purchase without review and instead encouraging these countries to buy more chips through government-to-government agreements to avoid smuggling and increase U.S. control.

The company also thinks the U.S. government should increase funding to ensure these export controls are properly enforced.

This statement by Anthropic is not particularly surprising. Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei has been one of the more vocal U.S. AI leaders in favor of export restrictions. Amodei wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in January about why the U.S. needs stronger chip export controls.

TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic for more information.

OpenAI has published a postmortem on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o — issues that forced the company to roll back an update to the model released last week.

Over the weekend, following the GPT-4o model update, users on social media noted that ChatGPT began responding in an overly validating and agreeable way. It quickly became a meme. Users posted screenshots of ChatGPT applauding all sorts of problematic, dangerous decisions and ideas.

In a post on X on Sunday, CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the problem and said that OpenAI would work on fixes “ASAP.” Two days later, Altman announced the GPT-4o update was being rolled back and that OpenAI was working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality.

According to OpenAI, the update, which was intended to make the model’s default personality “feel more intuitive and effective,” was informed too much by “short-term feedback” and “did not fully account for how users’ interactions with ChatGPT evolve over time.”

“As a result, GPT‑4o skewed towards responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous,” wrote OpenAI in its blog post. “Sycophantic interactions can be uncomfortable, unsettling, and cause distress. We fell short and are working on getting it right.”

OpenAI says it’s implementing several fixes, including refining its core model training techniques and system prompts to explicitly steer GPT-4o away from sycophancy. (System prompts are the initial instructions that guide a model’s overarching behavior and tone in interactions.) The company is also building more safety guardrails to “increase [the model’s] honesty and transparency,” and continuing to expand its evaluations to “help identify issues beyond sycophancy,” it says.

OpenAI also says that it’s experimenting with ways to let users give “real-time feedback” to “directly influence their interactions” with ChatGPT and choose from multiple ChatGPT personalities.

Roll back complete, imo this doesn't give almost any details of how and why things went 😑 https://t.co/cYj9iMaiy1 — Alex Volkov (Thursd/AI) (@altryne) April 30, 2025

“[W]e’re exploring new ways to incorporate broader, democratic feedback into ChatGPT’s default behaviors,” the company wrote in its blog post. “We hope the feedback will help us better reflect diverse cultural values around the world and understand how you’d like ChatGPT to evolve … We also believe users should have more control over how ChatGPT behaves and, to the extent that it is safe and feasible, make adjustments if they don’t agree with the default behavior.”

Duolingo is introducing 148 new language courses that were created with generative AI, the company announced on Wednesday. The launch comes as Duolingo has been facing backlash this week after sharing that it was going to replace contractors with AI and become an “AI-first” company.

The company says the launch of the new courses doubles its current course offerings and marks the largest expansion of content in Duolingo’s history.

“Developing our first 100 courses took about 12 years, and now, in about a year, we’re able to create and launch nearly 150 new courses,” said Duolingo co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn in a press release. “This is a great example of how generative AI can directly benefit our learners. This launch reflects the incredible impact of our AI and automation investments, which have allowed us to scale at unprecedented speed and quality.”

While Duolingo is touting its use of AI, the company is facing backlash from users who are disheartened by its plans to use the technology to replace workers and use it more deeply in its app.

On Monday, von Ahn told staff in an email that the company was shifting to AI and that it would “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle.” He also wrote that “headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.”

“Al isn’t just a productivity boost,” he wrote. “It helps us get closer to our mission. To teach well, we need to create a massive amount of content, and doing that manually doesn’t scale. One of the best decisions we made recently was replacing a slow, manual content creation process with one powered by AI. Without Al, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners. We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.”

Users have taken to social media to share their displeasure with the company’s plans, with some arguing that its use of AI is making the app worse with inaccurate and lower-quality content. Others have deleted the app and are encouraging others to follow suit.

As for the new language courses, Duolingo says they are primarily designed to support beginner levels. They include features such as Stories, which helps develop reading comprehension, and DuoRadio, which helps with listening comprehension. The company plans to launch more advanced content in the coming months.

The nonprofit behind Wikipedia on Wednesday revealed its new AI strategy for the next three years — and it’s not replacing the Wikipedia community of editors and volunteers with artificial intelligence, thankfully.

Instead, the Wikimedia Foundation says it will use AI to build new features that “remove technical barriers,” allowing editors, moderators, and patrollers tools that allow them to accomplish what they need to do, without worrying about how to “technically achieve it.”

Amid concerns that AI could eventually impact jobs held by people today, especially in terms of content creation, Wikipedia indicates that it intends to use AI as a tool that makes people’s jobs easier, not replace them.

Instead, the organization says that it will utilize generative AI in specific areas where it tends to excel.

This includes the creation of AI-assisted workflows that will automate tedious tasks. In addition, AI will be used to improve the discoverability of information on Wikipedia, giving editors more time for the human deliberation that’s required to build consensus over the creation, changes, and updates to Wikipedia entries.

AI will also aid editors by automating translation and will assist in the onboarding process of new volunteers.

“We believe that our future work with AI will be successful not only because of what we do, but how we do it,” writes Chris Albon, the director of machine learning at the Wikimedia Foundation, along with Leila Zia, Director and Head of Research at the Wikimedia Foundation, in a blog post announcing the news.

“Our efforts will use our long-held values, principles, and policies (like privacy and human rights) as a compass: we will take a human-centered approach and will prioritize human agency; we will prioritize using open-source or open-weight AI; we will prioritize transparency; and we will take a nuanced approach to multilinguality, a fundamental part of Wikipedia,” the post adds.

The organization also noted that maintaining Wikipedia’s knowledge base is a mission that’s grown in importance since the rise of generative AI, which today is known to make mistakes and hallucinate answers at times.

Hugging Face, the startup best known for the AI developer platform of the same name, is selling a programmable, 3D-printable robotic arm that can pick up and place objects and perform a few other basic chores.

Called the SO-101, the arm is the follow-up to Hugging Face’s previous robotic arm, the SO-100, released last year. The company’s robotics division, LeRobot, partnered with French robotics firm The Robot Studio to debut the SO-100 for around $100 in October.

Hugging Face teamed up with The Robot Studio once again for the SO-101, as well as with robotics store WowRobo, IoT hardware supplier Seeed Studio, and robotics part seller PartaBot.

Compared to the SO-100, the SO-101, which also starts at $100, is faster to assemble and features improved motors that reduce friction while allowing the arm to sustain its own weight. The camera-equipped arm can be trained via an AI technique called reinforcement learning, which allows it to “learn” to perform tasks like picking up a Lego block and placing it in a bin.

To be clear, $100 is the base price for the SO-101. Thanks to premiums on fully assembled units and U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, prices range from $100 to around $500, depending on the supplier.

ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

OpenAI promises to make changes to prevent future ChatGPT sycophancy

OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.

April 2025

OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable

OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.

OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations

An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”

ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping

OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.

OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance

OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market

OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models

OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step — sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”

OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark

Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.

OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks

OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.

OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks

OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.

OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini

OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.

OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers

Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.

All of your image creations, all in one place.



Introducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations—rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile and https://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg. pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj — OpenAI (@OpenAI) April 15, 2025

OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI

OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.

OpenAI is building its own social media network

OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.

OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July

OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers.

OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation

OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.

OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data

OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said.

OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns

The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.

OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations

Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”

OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models

OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.

OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1

OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.



PROMPT:



Please write a metafictional literary short story… — Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025

OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’

OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

ChatGPT can directly edit your code

The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains.

OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.

ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed

A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in.

More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.

OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan

Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.

OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks

ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.

Every major industry is racing to keep up with the latest developments in AI, but in finance, the stakes are uncommonly high. Financial institutions deal with huge sums of money every day, requiring an extraordinary degree of trust from their clients, and yet so much of this crucial decision-making is left to judgement calls and experience. Experts gather their research, draw conclusions, and make recommendations, but this process can be slow and imprecise—and all the while, fortunes hang in the balance. Overtaxed tech teams aren’t always prepared to handle every obstacle internally, and meanwhile, the work of business teams is too detailed for one-size-fits-all fixes. A field as specialized as finance demands solutions to match its complexities.

With advanced generative AI capabilities and deep institutional expertise from an experienced team, GenerativeX has already guided the pharmaceutical industry into the twenty-first century. This growing AI sophistication is now driving impact in finance, with precisely customized solutions to meet diverse needs. Instead of generic LLM assistance, GenerativeX’s AI agents are fine-tuned for financial services, informing executive strategy and eliminating tedious busywork with targeted use cases. Banking, private equity, insurance, asset management — each has room for improvement in their day-to-day. No matter the sector, no matter the business, GenerativeX’s AI agents can strengthen finance operations and recover valuable time for more effective work.

Individuality is vital in any approach to AI; its offerings must contour to the goals and workflows of a given client. AI output must take a shape that’s recognizable and useful to its intended audience: analysts can receive reports as word-processing documents or slide decks, conversational chatbots simulate in-person interactions for sales and negotiation, and higher-level ops teams can access dashboards presenting important insights at a glance. For financial institutions, being able to choose the solutions that most directly address what makes them unique creates a shorter route to success.

Consider the example of mergers and acquisitions, a field poised for overhaul with the help of AI. From end to end, the compiling of proposals for target companies can be drastically condensed with AI-driven automation, with each interconnected agent executing its designated role. Once supplied with information on the companies in question, a target analysis agent generates investment hypotheses, passing them to an orchestrator agent that coordinates research, comparative analysis, valuation, and slide-deck generation agents, while incorporating iterative feedback from a human banker at every stage. In a fraction of the time required to do so manually, a full-scale proposal comes together. Action can be taken with greater confidence, new hires learn on the job more easily, and everyone saves precious time. One major global financial institution has experienced the transformative impact of GenerativeX’s M&A agent with a 30% jump in their output of individual proposals.

AI agents can also carry a proposal through to execution, but M&A is only scratching the surface of what this technology can do for the world of finance. In real estate, AI can forecast the price of a designated property, automate the work of due diligence, and prepare transaction documents. For wealth management, it speeds up processes like succession planning, will preparation, and trust formation. Investment professionals benefit from AI-driven systems to screen deals, generate financial models, and garner committee support. Other use cases serve finance across various sectors, with the particulars adjusted for each specific business; compliance solutions, for one, are informed by each client’s internal policies. Trading, credit, insurance—AI services are changing the terrain everywhere, helping professionals navigate the complex world of finance with ease.

AI’s usefulness in securitization shows this adaptability in full force: an analyst begins the process by engaging a specialized AI orchestrator trained on the client’s proprietary knowledge database. The orchestrator then collaborates with a trust agent to review legal agreements, identifying key structural elements—such as involved parties, account relationships, and conditional triggers. The Excel agent fully automates complex financial modeling for investment banks and private equity funds. It can seamlessly handle selecting comparables, adjusting assumptions based on market information, and automating valuations and sensitivity analyses in an end-to-end process. Traditionally, analysts spend most of their time debugging models, but the Excel agent can now perform both debugging and insight generation, allowing one financial institution to save 80% of their time—a dramatic leap in both efficiency and insight.

Like any field running on data, finance involves a lot of repetitive tasks that eat up on-the-job hours without capitalizing on our human advantages. With GenerativeX’s AI solutions, we can all get these pieces of our workday back, and direct our intelligence where it’ll have a more meaningful impact. But the future of AI extends beyond streamlining and time savings to untapped new horizons of innovation in finance. Through GenerativeX’s multi-agent AI systems, users gain more leverage from their time: markets can be predicted with sharper intelligence, deals are made with less friction, and wealth goes farther. Everything’s getting smarter, and money is catching up.

And this is just the beginning, only one instance of the optimization that AI will put within reach of other domains and industries. The AI-driven speed and certitude that keep high finance running smoothly are becoming the new general standard, a swifter cadence for conducting business. As this sea change continues, the flexible, adaptable solutions of GenerativeX will be ready for whatever challenges might arise. The same targeted attention and customization that’s driving the next evolution in finance can benefit anyone, anywhere. AI doesn’t just go where it’s needed; it becomes what is needed.

The hype around AI continues to grow, and the technology is moving faster than even the most optimistic forecasts, reshaping what’s possible for startups almost overnight. While it’s always fun to discuss pie-in-the-sky ideas, the real question is not just what AI can do, but what it should do for your business.

Startups need measurable results: better products, faster time to market, smarter customer insights, and new revenue streams. What matters most is aligning AI with these business objectives and using infrastructure that can empower you to keep up with your competition, support growth, and please customers.

From my conversations with business leaders, the most important considerations fall into three categories:

Can I do what I do today more efficiently— faster, cheaper, or with fewer resources?

Can I grow my customer base faster and/or deliver more value to existing users?

Can I deliver new revenue from products or services I hadn’t previously considered?

The answers to these questions should help you decide where to spend time, where to invest, and how to build AI into your business.

Below are six key areas that you and other startup founders should keep in mind as you put AI to work.

1: Focus is critical

For startups, every decision matters, especially when evaluating AI choices. It’s important to make sure these investments are directly connected to business goals. Start by asking the three questions above and use the answers to help you choose the infrastructure tools needed to support your direction. In a world of distractions, focus gives you an edge. Pick tools that free up your time to solve the most important problems for your business.

One of the biggest advantages startups have today is the ability to fail fast and iterate rapidly. We’re now seeing a shift where rapid experimentation isn’t just for early-stage companies anymore. We recently worked with several customers in the core AI space that went from proof of concept to full-scale AI deployment in under three months. A year ago, that might’ve taken 12 months. Pick a cloud infrastructure partner that works the same way, enabling you to test quickly, iterate faster, and scale when you need. Focus isn’t about doing less – it’s about meeting customer needs faster.

2: Change is constant

The AI landscape isn’t just evolving—it may be accelerating faster than any other technology wave in the history of mankind. And now a new phase of agentic applications is upon us. This next wave of AI workloads will be defined by thousands of agents designed to talk to each other in short bursts to perform tasks. Imagine AI agents handling your DMV registration: one handles authentication, another takes payment, and another schedules delivery – all without you clicking through 10 screens.

This shift demands a new foundation. For this to work, agents need a standard way to talk to each other and access their data sources quickly. The Model Context Protocol is important in paving the way for a wave of AI-driven agentic applications which are designed to fetch and return responses to questions with minimal human help. Many of these applications are already emerging, with broader adoption likely in the next 12 to 18 months.

Startups seeking to capitalize on this shift must prioritize infrastructure that delivers real-time data access, low-latency networking, and the elasticity required to power agent-based ecosystems.

3: Innovation at every layer

The rapid growth of AI is driven by innovation across the entire stack, not only in the latest silicon, but in computer science techniques governing how LLMs work. Understanding this full range of innovation is crucial for staying ahead.

Take KV caching, which is the ability to reuse previous calculations for inferencing instead of recalculating everything at every step. This has the ability to save time, compute power, and money—essential factors for startups. Then there’s the Mixture of Experts technique that allows LLMs to break down complex problems and delegate each piece of the puzzle to the model—and associated infrastructure—best suited to handle it. For example, some tasks might be best served at lower cost if they run through CPUs rather than pricier GPUs. That is true for jobs relying on structured data originating in relational databases and applications, like Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications, that run on them.

When a business’s AI stack is optimized across layers, from data to model to compute, it can gain both efficiency and flexibility. This kind of innovation builds over time, and it starts with choosing infrastructure designed to support it.

4: Data remains core

Applications change all the time, but one thing remains constant: their reliance on large volumes of data, often in varying formats depending on the use case. As AI evolves toward more agentic and autonomous systems, the amount of data generated and consumed is growing exponentially. The more these systems interact, the more important it is to keep data close to where it’s being processed.

In many cases that means placing data as close as possible to required LLMs to minimize round trips that sap network performance. With Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), storage, compute, and models live side-by-side, helping to remove performance bottlenecks and maximize throughput.

Supporting AI workloads effectively while staying cost-efficient requires using a range of storage types tailored to different stages of the data lifecycle. OCI offers high-performance file systems like File Storage with Lustre for training large models, Object Storage for managing unstructured data, and Archive Storage for long-term retention, all designed to meet the price performance demands of AI-driven architectures.

Oracle brings decades of experience managing mission-critical data into our autonomous data platform. With OCI, startups can:

Seamlessly integrate advanced LLMs from a variety of providers or create your own

Parlay insights from Oracle Cloud Fusion Applications to feed their models

Tap directly into data from Oracle Database without additional integration overhead

Faster, direct access to the data not only enables improved system performance but also lays the foundation for quicker, more informed decision-making.

5: Commoditization continues

The path of technological evolution is clear: hardware horsepower rises as the price for that power is stabilizing. That trend will continue and, as noted before, innovation around the improved technology will carry on as well.

As a startup, take advantage of that commoditization and the flexibility it enables, without losing track of the problem you’re solving. What’s the value proposition, and how can cloud-powered AI help you build on it?

The right infrastructure foundation should support the pace without forcing trade-offs between cost, performance, and simplicity.

6: Be on the lookout for net-new business

Keeping your eye on the prize is critical but it doesn’t mean wearing blinders. AI is not just a tool enabling optimization—it can be a catalyst to discover completely new ideas.

While your business goals and product roadmap are being advanced, it’s important to stay alert to new opportunities that AI might surface. These may be in adjacent areas or perhaps crop up out of the blue in some orthogonal way.

Take a startup helping restaurants optimize staffing schedules. The original product is simple: use past data and forecasts to reduce overstaffing and minimize staff burnout. But over time, its AI models started surfacing that demand surges don’t match historical foot traffic. Digging deeper, the startup realized the spikes correlate with local events, weather shifts, and even social media trends about specific menu items. That insight turns into a new product altogether: a hyperlocal demand prediction API, not just for restaurants but for brands, delivery platforms, or anyone trying to forecast foot traffic and purchasing behavior. That’s not an iteration – that’s a new category creation. And it happened by noticing a signal no one was looking for.

These are the kinds of opportunities AI can unlock, helping to move from cost savings to net-new revenue and long-term business value. That’s the real potential of deploying AI with purpose: not just automation, but meaningful growth.

Speed Alone Isn’t Enough

With so much innovation across infrastructure, models, and applications, it’s easy to get caught up in chasing the newest thing. Startups are inclined to move fast and test boundaries, but sustainable impact comes from knowing where to focus.

The question is not whether to adopt AI, but where to apply it. Every initiative needs to tie back to a clear objective, whether it’s improving efficiency, accelerating customer growth, or creating new revenue. Startups that stay grounded in practical outcomes and align with the right partners are most likely to lead the next wave of innovation.

Success in AI won’t be about who moves first, but who moves with purpose, concentrates on the right problem, and makes sure the infrastructure, data, and models are aligned to solve it.

Break Down the Path to Sustainable Success

As a first-time visitor to Silicon Valley, Eddie Yu, founder of OKOsix navigated the unknown in tandem with his fellow founders, shared a flat, forged lasting bonds, and emerged from his cocoon of uncertainty with newfound confidence endowed by the Global Booster, a six-month programme organised by HKSTP, partnering with global innovation platform Plug and Play, a move to assert growth ambitions of the I&T ecosystem, provides comprehensive training and fundraising support tailored to business development needs for each startup .

“Together, we practiced and refined our presentation until it was pitch-perfect,” he recalled. Not only did he willed interests from 80 potential investors for its specialty in compostable solutions, some of them flew in Hong Kong for due diligence and see if there are even more potential for the biodegradable materials applied beyond the use in disposable medical, hygiene, and personal care products.

The unforgettable experience dubbed “once in a lifetime” by Eddie himself, offering invaluable insights that significantly changed OKOsix’s trajectory, refining plans to scale manufacturing, and adapting to global demand – this realignment allowed him to adjust fundraising strategies to prioritize growth stages. Eddie also expressed gratitude for the time spent with four other startup founders. “Their businesses are much more mature than mine,” he said, “and became a kind of guidance and inspiration for me.” The sentiment extends to the local community in more ways than one, ultimately leading to the recruitment of their new Chief Innovation Officer with a doctorate in chemistry at Stanford University, and financial advisors each chiming in respective expertise.

Said with amusement, “I still remember the looks on other countries’ startup representatives when they learned about our programme, astounded and envious in equal measure!”

Even the Intangible Gains are Off the Charts

GoGoChart serves a diverse range of enterprise customers across various industries, notably mobile gaming and finance, with an impressive portfolio boasting over 2,000 clients, GoGoChart has distinguished itself as a pioneering provider of strategies and solutions in digital marketing.

The app had its visibility optimized and conversions driven by strong online presence, tinkering with strategic boosts, algorithms for ranking, ratings, keywords, and store listings, the list goes on. Though, competition in the field remains tough nonetheless, the solution carried spotlight as a rising star in startup awards from both Deloitte and Financial Times. Given its track record, participating in the programme was a logical step for GoGoChart, empowering them to expand into the US market.

While this visit was not his first, Daniel Lo, CEO of GoGoChart found an even deeper connection with the business culture and community this time. Described as one of those awakening moments, he delved deeply into engaging with locals, and gaining a profound understanding of how the ecosystem operates.

Lo recounted: “Each day began with an early morning start, Plug and Play curated a packed schedule of sessions with mentors and investors, so we get to make the most of our time together. Dinners often featured engaging conversations with individuals from various professional backgrounds. As night fell on the West Coast, a new day began in Hong Kong; we founders worked late into the morning to stay on the line with our teams.”

He further explained that weekends often presented with unique opportunities for their professional networks to flourish. “We’d invite our new connections back to our place for a bite and get-togethers, strengthening trusts and bonds.” he said.

Despite setbacks and rejections, the networking effort ultimately paid off handsomely when Lightspeed Venture Partners, a prominent multi-stage venture capital firm, invited GoGoChart to conduct a health check on the digital marketing strategies of their portfolio companies, and from there, GoGoChart has demonstrated remarkable growth at a compound rate.

“I had the privilege of braving the unknown alongside my fellow founders in Silicon Valley,” Lo still recalled with excitement. “One particularly memorable moment was when we boldly decided to cold-pitch venture capitalists at a café in Menlo Park – a hub for these investors to congregate and share their insights.”

“Perhaps the least tangible – yet most rewarding thing – was the opportunity to surround myself with the world’s brightest minds, which only served to make me humbler and more cognizant of the importance of hard work, perseverance, and a commitment to lifelong learning.” he reflected.

The Global Booster Programme has been hailed as a transformative experience to empower startups in breaking new grounds while fostering their founders’ personal growth, as an epitome of values HKSTP holds at heart, the “booster bunch” for the second cohort is now ready to fly from the city to markets around the world, entrepreneurship will no longer perceived as a solo journey, but an exploration odyssey.

As nations and private companies race to mine the Moon and beyond, a new frontier in space exploration is emerging—one that stays right here on Earth. The Faroe Islands Space Program is redefining exploration by harnessing the Moon’s gravitational pull to generate clean, predictable tidal energy. With 80% of global energy still derived from fossil fuels, the need for sustainable alternatives has never been more urgent. Tidal energy, with a global potential of 650 GW, remains vastly underutilized, yet could play an important part of the future energy mix. By leveraging the ocean’s natural rhythms, this initiative challenges traditional views on space exploration and highlights the need to make the most of the resources we already have.

“We estimate there are at least 3000 more “Faroe Islands” out there qualifying for our space program – if they all join, moon energy could replace all coal power capacity currently under development globally”, says Martin Edlund, CEO of Minesto, one of the initiators of the Faroe Islands Space Program.

Luna 12 is turning the tide for renewable energy

For the past year, global industry leader SKF, ocean energy developer Minesto, and one of the world’s smallest national energy companies, Sev, have been piloting Luna 12— a cutting-edge tidal kite designed to harness the Moon’s gravitational pull for predictable, renewable tidal energy off the coast of the Faroe Islands. Luna 12 is the first mega-watt kite at a capacity of 1.2 MW – enough to power 200 homes annually, no matter the weather. Following its success, the partners have demonstrated that tidal energy can be both cost-competitive and scalable—unlocking a powerful, untapped resource that could reshape the future of clean energy.

Now, as operations in the Faroe Islands transition to the next phase, SKF and Minesto are launching the Faroe Islands Space Program. The next goal of the program is to implement a 200 MW tidal energy array, supporting the small island nation’s goal of 100% renewable energy by 2030. Once operational, the facility could supply 40% of the territory’s expected electricity needs, delivering clean, reliable energy to its 50,000 residents and 70,000 sheep in this remote North Atlantic archipelago.

How SKF and Minesto are engineering innovation for a sustainable future

Since its founding in 1907, SKF has been at the forefront of innovation in bearings, seals, condition monitoring systems, lubrication systems, and related services—all designed with one primary goal: reducing friction. With applications spanning over 40 industries, these technologies play a crucial role in fighting friction and improving efficiency. Research shows that 20 percent of all energy consumed globally is used to overcome friction. By minimizing it, we can optimize resource use, particularly in energy production, where every unit generated should contribute to the power grid rather than being lost to friction.

“Imagine a future powered by the tides of the Moon. This unique project dares to dream big and is exploring the potential of renewable tidal energy. At SKF we are proud to be a part of this down-to-earth project that aligns with our values and our ambition to create a more sustainable world,” says Annika Ölme, Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of SKF.

Tethered to the seabed at a depth of ~50 meters and operating at speeds of 16 knots, the 12-meter-long (39.4-foot) Luna 12 kite withstands extreme forces, demanding precise engineering for smooth, controlled movement and durability. SKF was brought on board by Minesto to design the bearing and sealing systems for its rudders and elevators, optimizing performance under harsh conditions. Using advanced software, SKF also calculates bearing lifespan and CO2 emissions, helping engineers balance technical efficiency with sustainability. This initiative clearly shows how collaboration across industries is essential for progress. ”Together with Minesto, we are demonstrating how technology and innovation can drive the transition to renewable energy”, says Annika Ölme.

Why renewable and predictable moon energy is important for the Faroe Islands

The Moon’s gravitational pull is responsible for approximately 70% of tidal movement, making tidal energy, in essence, ‘moon energy’. Unlike solar, wind, and hydro power, which fluctuate with the weather, tidal energy is 100% predictable as it depends on the Moon’s orbit, which remains stable over long timescales. This predictability makes tidal energy a uniquely reliable renewable source.

The Faroe Islands’ slow-moving underwater currents pose a challenge for traditional tidal power systems, which struggle to generate sufficient energy in such conditions. This makes the region an ideal test site for Luna 12, a tidal kite designed to operate efficiently in low-flow environments. Using hydrodynamic lift, Luna 12 propels itself through ocean currents like a wind kite. Its autonomous control system steers it in a figure-eight trajectory, significantly increasing the speed of water flow through its turbine—allowing it to generate energy even in areas where conventional turbines fall short.

Sev, the Faroese municipally owned energy company, is actively supporting tidal energy development and has built key infrastructure to integrate Luna 12 into the electrical grid. With abundant natural resources and predictable tides, this project could play a crucial role in the Faroe Islands’ goal of achieving 100% renewable energy by 2030. “We believe that tidal power may prove to become a vital part of this journey,” says Hákun Djurhuus, CEO of the Faroese electricity company Sev.

The Faroe Islands Space Program highlights how knowledge-sharing and collaboration drive sustainability, showcasing tidal energy’s vast untapped potential in the renewable energy landscape. It underscores the importance of leveraging existing natural resources to build a cleaner, more resilient energy future.

With offices in New York, Stockholm, and San Francisco, Modal is redefining how developers build and scale AI-based applications, providing a serverless platform that eliminates the need to manage infrastructure.

Leveraging Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) AI infrastructure, Modal enables developers to run demanding AI workloads—such as model training, fine-tuning, and large-scale batch processing—without sweating the details of managing infrastructure and higher-level tooling.

In this conversation, Mahesh Thiagarajan, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, sat down with Modal chief executive officer, Erik Bernhardsson—who previously led engineering teams at Spotify building its music recommendation system—to discuss the challenges of AI infrastructure, why Modal chose OCI, and what’s next for AI development at scale.

Thiagarajan: Could you give us a little background on Modal and what problems you’re solving?

Bernhardsson: Modal is a serverless platform for AI, ML, and data developers. We make it easy to build and scale AI workloads in the cloud without dealing with the infrastructure headaches. Our focus is on making it easy to build applications and run AI workloads in the cloud. A lot of our work stems from frustration with existing platforms and tools, and the developer experience. Scaling AI infrastructure is hard—provisioning GPUs, managing containers, handling networking—so we built a platform where developers don’t have to think about any of that. Instead of spending weeks setting up infrastructure, they can just write code and deploy it instantly.

Thiagarajan: As a startup, what are your top challenges—tech, hiring, funding?

Bernhardsson: Hiring and growth. Right now, capital isn’t a bottleneck for us—it’s about supporting our customers and bringing in the right people to scale effectively. I’ve worked at startups for my whole career, 15-20 years—the core thing is your people and who you hire. Hire scrappy, commercially minded, smart people, and you’re 80% of the way there.

Thiagarajan: On the business side, what are some of the problems Modal is solving?

Bernhardsson: Customers want to focus on what they’re good at, which is training models or building great consumer experiences, while we handle all the scaling, infrastructure management, provisioning, and containerization. Take one of our customers, Suno. Instead of hiring a massive team to manage their infrastructure, they use Modal. We handle the compute, the scaling, and the deployment, so they can focus on their core product. Our biggest value proposition to customers is that their engineers can move faster with Modal. They don’t have to build and maintain their own platform or worry about capacity planning. With Modal, developers who are using generative AI to create new applications, such as those used to compose music or design novel protein structures, can access a platform that delivers fast and reliable GPUs. With Modal using OCI AI infrastructure, developers building on Modal can ship code, get their data and AI models into production, and test applications much faster. Customers, especially AI startups also love our serverless business and pricing model that makes it easy for them to get started with a small team and build something really cool without breaking the bank.

Thiagarajan: Can you share details about why you chose OCI and how its helping Modal solve problems for customers?

Bernhardsson: We’ve been very impressed with the hardware and the fact that Oracle offers bare metal instances, along with super-fast networking, disk and CPUs, and then the GPUs themselves, of course. OCI’s bare metal instances have been phenomenal at delivering value for our customers. We can provide the capacity our customers need, often with very short lead times. But beyond that, the agility of Oracle’s sales process has been a game changer. If I need to do a large scale out of my GPU environment, I can literally text someone and get them provisioned quickly. That kind of flexibility and partnership is rare.

Thiagarajan: AI infrastructure is getting crowded. How do you see the market? Where does OCI fit in, and how do you differentiate?

Bernhardsson: I think what Oracle is doing extremely well is managing the hardware, the compute, the data centers, and doing that at a massive scale. Modal, on the other hand, is focused on the developer experience. We provide a serverless platform with clean APIs, Python SDKs, and instant execution. It’s a different part of the stack. There’s plenty of room for multiple players in this space. OCI AI infrastructure provides the raw power, and we make it easy for developers to access and scale it without friction.

Thiagarajan: Everyone’s talking about AI, but what’s underreported or overlooked?

Bernhardsson: I think audio and music are interesting. Historically, music tech has often been ahead of the curve—whether it was the gramophone, MP3s, or music streaming. Big shifts in technology tend to show up in music before spreading to other areas. We’ve seen a lot of AI applications already, but I still feel like we’re very early in understanding where this is all going. Fast forward 10 or 20 years and I think AI-generated music and audio will be far beyond where we are today. It’s exciting to watch because I think there’s a lot of untapped potential that people aren’t talking about as much as other AI breakthroughs.

Thiagarajan: What broader AI trends do you find interesting?

Bernhardsson: One of the most exciting shifts is the realization that AI breakthroughs don’t have to rely on massive compute budgets. It’s been a little frustrating for me as someone with a math, computer science, and physics background because I want to believe in small, lean, scrappy teams solving very hard problems. Major breakthroughs weren’t capital-limited—they were driven by lean teams making clever innovations. A small, smart team that’s focused can also make a lot of progress. If AI is going to break through and change this world, we need it to be available to small teams. There are very few technological breakthroughs in the past where capital was the limiting factor, right? It’s often small teams with innovative, clever applications that drive things.

Thiagarajan: I think the point you’re illustrating is that continuous innovation can mean finding creative ways to use hardware to get the same outcome a lot more efficiently, right?

Bernhardsson: Exactly. We’re going to see a major shift toward efficiency in AI infrastructure. If we look back 15 or even 10 years ago, you didn’t need a billion dollars to make a breakthrough. But now you need it. Over the next 10–15 years, I expect AI training costs to drop by orders of magnitude as we refine models, improve algorithms, and develop efficient hardware. We still have a long way to go, and AI training is wildly inefficient compared to the human brain. There’s so much room for improvement, and that’s where the next wave of innovation will come from.

Green Tech from Local Roots to Globally Approved

Behind the glamour of innovation, it all comes down to making a better way of living, and that “living” supposedly reaches beyond humankind. Coral reefs have been suffering from the destruction of the marine ecosystem with climate change, pollutants, and overharvesting. Archireef, which came along in 2020, is pioneering the restoration.



Founded in Hong Kong, Archireef introduced a new use for terracotta clay and made the world’s first 3D-printed Reef Tiles™ that gives a chance to hold off the damage and wins championship in the Elevator Pitch Competition (EPIC) 2021.



Last year alone, EPIC put over 600 entries of international innovators from 47 economies in one spot, as the largest tech event in Hong Kong, it’s destined for “growth” to soar from there.



Since then, widespread recognition has brought Archireef to the Middle Eastern coast, with backing from Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) secured, one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the region, the partnership has not only meant capital but has also large-scale production of end-to-end eco-engineering solutions is able to steer the company towards global expansion in marine conservation and managing nature risks in the oceans.

That explains the growing client base of the nature-risk management company, local and international corporations including Swire Bulk, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), AD Ports Group, Sino Group and Chow Sang Sang, all contributing to climate resilience and biodiversity recovery in mitigating long-term risks and costs.

Digital Health Tech Potential in Applying to be Physicians Assistants

Imagine a group of data scientists huddled over in Silicon Valley and come up with yet another adaptation of AI – pretty much how Leapstack was founded back in 2016. By leveraging AI and machine learning, its platform can be trained to analyze claimant data and provide personalized recommendations, insurers across countries are able to streamline claim processes and optimize policies.



“We aspired to become to go-to for health insurance players around the world.” Cole Gu, Co-founder and CEO of Leapstack says, fully aware of the obstacles where Insurtech is not a one-size-fit-all with risk scenarios, compliance and regulatory vary from country to country.



A eureka moment doesn’t guarantee success if it lacks investment opportunities or partnership support – exactly what EPIC offers, to put the misery to the often dire situation for startups to get their ideas off the ground.



“Once the match between startups and their support system hit it off, it’s all smooth sailing from there.” would be outright a dream too good to be true. Following Leapstack’s participation in EPIC 2023 all the way to the semifinals, they’ve continued evolving into a leading digital healthcare platform in Asia with a strong presence in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Indonesia, and its origin, Mainland China, going from mere coverage in Shanghai, to taking on nearly one-third of social medical insurance fund monitoring projects in the market, had them becoming a trusted service provider for claim management systems of top-tier international health insurers including Manulife and AIA in the Chinese society, leveraging cutting-edge AI to reshape the health insurance value chain and connect stakeholders.



That earned more than a ticket but an invitation from HKSTP to join its Elite programme, exclusive for those that show potential to head for global markets, the three-year milestone-based funding initiative consist of expert guidance, funding support, as well as comprehensive go-to-market strategies for more, according to Gu, “a presence in the Hong Kong market itself is a defining moment for us. We’re drawn to Hong Kong’s sound regulatory environment and strong global reputation in the insurance and reinsurance markets. Use cases that can be easier in adapting to other emerging markets also helped making this rather easy call operating in Hong Kong.”



Not to mention that Hong Kong boasts the highest global insurance penetration rate and the second-highest insurance density, solidifying its position as an Insurtech innovation hub, despite its relatively small population of 7.5 million.



Leapstack also embarked on another rewarding international journey led by HKSTP, “In January, we participated in the ‘Think Business, Think Hong Kong’ event in Jakarta, Indonesia to explore opportunities across Asia, ” notes Gu on his observations, “Customers in emerging markets are increasingly aware of their health protection gaps and purchasing coverage as a result.” and prior to that, Leapstack joined the delegation visiting the UAE last year to meet with local technical partners, industry leaders and regulatory bodies, extending the experience of international support.

Epic Traction for Tech and Talent

These inspiring stories are part of the reason EPIC kept going and announced its 9th edition will be competing for an investment pool of 100 million and cash prize of $240,000 in three tech tracks – Digital Health Tech, Green Tech, FinTech. A global open call for innovators has just appeared on the radar, and finalists from all corners will be flown to cruise terminal in Hong Kong for the finale to unfold in November.



Not just any competition. essence of the event is to break something, of borders, of sectors, of limits – if past years were any indication, anticipation for outreaching overseas should only build from now on for EPIC 2025, open calling global registration until 17 June 2025, 23:59 (GMT +8) – it’s about time to make your own EPIC story, visit epic.hkstp.org to learn more.



Innovators emerging from stealth mode need to be seen.

Startups are leading the generative AI charge by experimenting with new applications across industries, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, and advancing the technology’s potential. They are the engine of gen AI innovation in a rapidly evolving landscape. Chamath Palihapitiya, Founder and CEO, Social Capital: “I think AI is more than just an ongoing shift: it’s a hyper-disruption. The traditional software industry, with its complex products, high cost, balkanized features, and licensing models, is being completely reimagined.”

We asked 23 industry leaders and investors their perspective on the most critical AI and Cloud AI innovations, trends, opportunities and challenges that startup leaders need to be aware of in 2025 and beyond in Google Cloud’s Future of AI: Perspectives for Startups 2025 report.

The evolving role of AI agents in business

Among the trends discussed, AI agents were the leading topic of conversation. The growing innovation of AI leaders with agents comes as no surprise, but their collective vision of how these agentic systems will evolve reveals an intriguing perspective on the increasingly sophisticated interactions we’ll soon encounter and their business implications.

The opportunities seem quite expansive. For example, Matthieu Rouif, Co-Founder and CEO, Photoroom, emphasizes AI becoming increasingly adept at recognizing and responding to human emotions; this could enable AI systems to tailor content and experiences to individual emotional responses in ways that create more meaningful connections. According to Harrison Chase, CEO and Co-Founder, LangChain; “To truly leverage agentic systems, I want them to scale beyond just what I can ask them to do– to be ‘ambient agents,’ running in the background, always on, monitoring streams of events, and alerting me only when something interesting happens or when they need my help.” Such intelligence and deep personalization could transform customer experience and business relationships, marking a significant evolution from today’s task-oriented AI to tomorrow’s empathetic digital companions.

Besides the impact on customer experience, according to Jennifer Li, General Partner, a16z, AI agents are also transforming the developer experience. “ Coding has turned out to be one of the most mature spaces in AI because it has more easily verifiable results and a fast feedback loop. You can check if the results are correct, and there’s already a lot of tooling, from testing to validation, to help figure out if the model has performed the way you want. It can be as simple as autocomplete or as involved as an agent building a full blown app.”

Rethinking AI infrastructure for the next generation

Yet for all the amazing leaps AI is offering, almost none of it would be possible without the right infrastructure, which is another major focus topic.

“Tight synchronization and massive compute requirements push infrastructure to never-seen-before levels of compute density and capability,” said Amin Vahdat, VP & GM for Systems and Cloud AI, Google Cloud.

The future infrastructure landscape will likely be characterized by modular architectures that combine smaller, specialized models across different data modalities, supported by sophisticated orchestration and observability layers. Mayada Gonimah, CTO & Co-Founder, Thread AI, highlights that: “Integrations and infrastructure for observable workflow management will become even more critical parts of the AI stack. Companies will need interfaces that let them insert AI in their existing workflows and test them in parallel to existing processes. I think being more intentional around where you embed AI and having the tooling around observability is going to be key moving forward as we build these production-worthy AI-native workflows.”

Infrastructure efficiency will become a critical competitive differentiator, with organizations that achieve twice the efficiency gaining significant market advantages. Arvind Jain, CEO, Glean, emphasizes the importance of designing your infrastructure to be more agnostic to model and tooling advancements. “Predict what’s coming and enable plug-and-play where feasible to take advantage of updates without massive overhauls or disruptions.”



Cloud providers will continue to play a central role, but successful organizations will build flexible systems that can seamlessly integrate new models and technologies. For a deep dive around impactful trends like multimodal AI, customer experience, enterprise search, and more technical advancements, check out the full report.

Areas investors are prioritizing for AI startups in 2025

The AI investors in the report are zeroing in on startups that deliver concrete solutions to real-world challenges, moving beyond the initial AI hype. Salim Teja, Partner, Radical Ventures, is focused on startups that use AI to address real problems such as improving health, fighting diseases, combating climate change, and addressing the affordable housing crisis through robotics in construction.

Having data alone isn’t enough — investors want to see strategic use of high-quality, secure data that enhances AI performance in specific applications. Venture capitalists are particularly drawn to solutions that boost productivity and transform business operations, especially in developer tools. Raviraj Jain, Partner, Lightspeed, points out that “all organizations have to think like VCs (Venture Capitalists)—even though you’re beholden to quarterly results, you still have to think five to ten years ahead and how your organization and market structure will change, and how critical it will be to leverage AI as part of that change.”

The winning formula? A clear competitive edge, path to profitability, and deep integration into user workflows. According to Crystal Huang, General Partner, GV, “if your product is easy to implement, it’s just as easy to uninstall. Products need to be stickier to create lasting value, which means being both indispensable and deeply integrated into the user’s workflow.”

Leapfrog the competition and create a defensible position

In today’s competitive AI landscape, building a defensible market position requires a sophisticated strategy that goes beyond simply implementing the latest models.



David Friedberg, CEO, Ohalo Genetics, put it this way: “If you’re just an LLM wrapper, it’s going to be hard to build a sustainable business — you’re likely going to get commoditized away. Businesses need an engine of value creation that persists with an initial advantaged offering with continuous improvements. This will typically come from proprietary data generation, which is used to continuously improve model performance, or network effects that lock-in access to data or customers.”

Douwe Kiela, CEO, Contextual AI highlights the need for speed and focus in the AI market. “Move fast. Time to market is the most important thing for a startup, and the market is now. Things are moving incredibly fast in AI, so you have to make sure you’re not left behind.”

Staying ahead of the competition is not just about the technology. How AI companies monetize and sell their AI is as important as how they build it. As Jerry Chen, Partner, Greylock, states “your competition is no longer against the incumbent, it is against the incumbent’s business model.”

Looking ahead

The breakneck pace of change being driven by generative AI means that startups are facing unprecedented challenges. At Google Cloud, we’re collaborating with researchers, founders, startups, investors, enterprises, partners, and public sector agencies to think critically about how our responsible AI solutions can meet the needs of employees, customers, patients, and citizens.

For digital health companies looking to deploy their AI solution into clinical workflows, the potential return-on-investment is limitless. Currently, 94% of healthcare companies employ AI/ML in some capacity, while the industry’s average estimated budget allocation to these technologies is projected to grow from 5.7% in 2022 to 10.5% by the end of 2024.

But despite these numbers, there are still major hurdles in place for companies looking to commercialize their AI solution and get it into healthcare workflows.

Cost: The initial investment in developing, deploying, and commercializing an AI solution for healthcare often stops developers in their tracks. Acquiring high-quality, complete data and a streamlined way to deploy into clinical workflows costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Competition: 4500+ digital health companies have started since January 2023 in the United States alone. Currently, there are more than 700 FDA-cleared healthcare algorithms.3 With such a crowded space, it can be extremely difficult for digital health companies to get their solution to stand out from their competition. Timeline: While trying to get their healthcare solution in front of providers before competition is mission critical, the timeline of developing, testing, and deploying an AI solution is staggering. Depending on the complexity of the model, it can take anywhere from three to 36 months for a solution to get into the clinical workflow.

The digital revolution has reshaped industries and everyday life, unlocking unprecedented opportunities. Yet, beneath its promise lies a growing menace: critical vulnerabilities that threaten the very systems we rely on. When systems falter—from financial networks that underpin economies to public services essential to daily activities—the resulting chaos ripples across societies, disrupting businesses, eroding trust, and endangering livelihoods.

Enter “Fraud as a Service” (FaaS), a sinister twist on the “Software as a Service” (SaaS) model that has revolutionized legitimate industries. Fueled by deepfake technology and scalable tools, FaaS has proliferated on the dark web, evolving

into accessible and affordable platforms. These platforms target and exploit our digital lifelines, amplifying fraud to an unprecedented heights.

Cybercriminals no longer need sophisticated tools or advanced technical expertise to execute disruptive illegal activities. The barriers to accessing AI and deepfake devices have virtually disappeared—they are now just a few clicks away.

Multiple reports reveal an alarming surge in fraudulent incidents within the fintech industry, with increases of several hundred percent in 2023, highlighting the growing scale and accessibility of these schemes.

FaaS platforms offer generative AI-powered fraud services through subscription like models, enabling even non-technical users to deploy realistic voice, video, and image manipulations. For as little as $20, anyone can impersonate executives, forge identities, or create convincing videos to bypass security protocols.

This isn’t just fraud—it’s fraud at an industrial scale. A single individual can now target thousands of employees simultaneously. In short, welcome to the democratization of fraud.

Fighting Back in the New Digital Age

Despite the bleak outlook, the battle against fraud in this digital era is far from hopeless. While traditional security systems—such as passwords, knowledge based authentication, and basic biometric checks—are proving increasingly inadequate, multi-layered approaches are emerging as robust solutions to these growing threats and problems.

Fraudsters can exploit outdated technologies to bypass identity checks that rely solely on static images or voice recordings. However, innovative solutions, such as advanced biometric technologies paired with comprehensive fraud detection systems, are rendering such practices ineffective.

At Incode, the company I co-founded nearly a decade ago, we developed a wide-ranging variety of tools that not only verify identities but also actively distinguish between genuine and fraudulent users, eliminating digital vulnerabilities at their source.

Some of the key solutions we offer to prevent and detect fraudulent activities include:

Advanced Personhood Detection: Real-time liveness detection, facial recognition, and document verification ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to digital networks.

Real-time liveness detection, facial recognition, and document verification ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to digital networks. Streamlined Integration: A frictionless setup within existing technology stacks accelerates deployment and enhances verification for sensitive interactions.

A frictionless setup within existing technology stacks accelerates deployment and enhances verification for sensitive interactions. Continuous Identity Monitoring: AI-driven monitoring tracks and highlights suspicious identity signals across interactions, enabling proactive defenses against generative AI threats.

These technologies allow organizations to build a robust ecosystem capable of combating the evolving tactics of fraudsters, securing digital systems, and restoring trust in the digital age.

The once-reliable multi-factor authentication (MFA) system, a cornerstone of modern security, is increasingly inadequate against sophisticated attacks. AI has significantly undermined its effectiveness; by mimicking vocal patterns or generating lifelike images, attackers can easily bypass MFA, making social engineering attacks more prevalent than ever. Meanwhile, physical identification methods, such as ID documents, are equally vulnerable to digital manipulation.

In short, most traditional security systems are no match for the new capabilities of generative AI.

To combat these advanced threats, Incode’s cutting-edge technology provides the robust solutions organizations are seeking to safeguard their operations. Our tools address these vulnerabilities head-on, offering reliable protection against the costly, disruptive consequences of AI-driven fraud.

Financial Sector: A Canary in the Coal Mine

Banks and financial institutions are on the frontlines of this battle. In 2024, a Hong Kong firm lost $25 million after an employee fell victim to a deepfake video impersonating their CFO. This was not an isolated incident; many such cases remain unreported. Generative AI’s ability to produce hyper-realistic content has made it an ideal weapon for fraudsters.

According to the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, AI-enabled fraud losses are projected to grow to $40 billion in 2027, from $12.3 billion in 2023 –or more than quadruple its estimated current cost. The financial sector’s reliance on identity verification, trust, and authenticity makes it uniquely vulnerable to such threats, necessitating a robust response.

Incode Workforce: Protecting Organizations at Scale

Our Incode Workforce platform exemplifies a multi-layered approach. Designed to secure access at every stage of the employee lifecycle, it enhances Identity Access Management Systems (IAM), integrating advanced personhood detection, seamless biometric verification, and fraud detection. Whether onboarding remote employees or safeguarding sensitive operations, Incode Workforce ensures that only verified, living individuals interact with your business systems and assets.

In partnership with Okta, the leading independent Identity partner that frees everyone to safely use any technology, we’ve even extended our capabilities to enable organizations to securely verify the “real world identity” of who they’re interacting with.

The Incode-Okta Workforce Identity integration strengthens security for high-risk scenarios such as:

Identity Verification at MFA Enrollment: . Enabling identity proofing for all employees before MFA enrollment.

. Enabling identity proofing for all employees before MFA enrollment. Help Desk and Account Recovery: Minimize social engineering risks by automating identity validation and reducing support tickets.

Minimize social engineering risks by automating identity validation and reducing support tickets. Step-Up Verification for Critical Workflows: Secure high-value transactions through our biometric verification, protect sensitive data access, and more.

“As a security practitioner, I see Incode’s partnership with Okta as a pivotal step in addressing emerging threats like AI-driven fraud. The combination of biometric verification with robust IAM capabilities ensures a higher standard of security for enterprises navigating today’s complex risk landscape,” said Mukund Sarma, Security Lead at Chime.

Keeping Pace: Accelerating Fraud Prevention

As FaaS continues to evolve, fraud is advancing at an unprecedented pace. Defenses must keep up. By investing in advanced biometric systems and adopting proactive, multi-layered defense strategies, organizations can stay ahead of these escalating challenges.

Incode’s recognition as a Leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Identity Verification highlights our commitment to innovation and excellence in addressing these critical issues. This achievement reflects our technological leadership and validates our focus on building trust through cutting-edge solutions.

Being named a Leader underscores the strength of our robust, scalable, and user-friendly solutions to combat AI-driven fraud. It reaffirms our belief that organizations can achieve top-tier security without compromising agility or customer experience.

At Incode, our mission is to empower businesses with the tools to not only defend against today’s threats but also anticipate tomorrow’s challenges.

How emerging expectations help guide banks in transforming customer expectations

By: Jeff Chan, Senior Manager, Enterprise Innovation, TD Bank Group

The question every organization asks: what will consumers want next? As consumer expectations evolve, organizations must be better able to anticipate these shifts to stay ahead. How do we do that? For starters, understanding and applying consumer trends as part of decision making can increase confidence that an idea will resonate with modern consumers. These trends are not predictions or definitive answers. Instead, they may help innovative organizations ask different questions when brainstorming the next great experience. Here are three emerging trends to consider:

Trust and Transparency goes both ways

“Is this real?” This question is becoming more common when customers receive an electronic communication from their financial institution. As technology blurs the line between authenticity and deception, trust must be a core focus. The rise of low-cost Generative AI tools can have both a positive impact for good businesses and usher us into a new era of concern when it is in the hands of bad actors. Scams and fake content have become so prevalent that consumers are being pushed to go directly to the source for truth. As such, banks not only need to continue protecting their services, but also need to prove to consumers that they are who they say they are. One example of this type of service are the AI-powered anti-scam measures introduced by Commonwealth Bank in Australia. The result? Customer scam losses were cut in half. Some have features to re-assure customers they are, in fact, talking to their bank. For example, Barclays in the United Kingdom introduced an in-app call verification feature to help confirm that an inbound call from them was legitimate. In January, Revolut, a leading global fintech, rolled out in-app calls to their customers. The purpose of this new security measure helps customers know that Revolut will only call them through the app, which allows them to more easily identify potential impersonation scams via traditional phone lines.

Seeking balance in a digital world

Many consumers are growing weary of a digital-first lifestyle and yearn for balance. Accenture’s 2025 Life Trends Report found that 42% of global respondents said, “their most enjoyable experience in the previous week was a physical one, while only 15% said it was digital”. To me the data suggests that consumers could be seeking balance, perhaps using tools that take care of repetitive tasks so they can free up much needed time for real-life experiences. In the future, as consumer adoption increases with smarter AI, it could mean adopting AI to help make certain decisions on consumers’ behalf. For financial services, this could mean introducing a true hybrid human/AI experience where intelligent virtual assistants, powered by agentic AI, could perform tasks that include optimizing a client’s trading portfolio to executing trades on their behalf. By doing so, the AI frees up a client’s time so they can spend more time connecting with their financial advisor to better understand additional needs that only a human can.

Navigating the unknown

In 2022, Collins Dictionary declared ‘permacrisis’ the Word of The Year. The term reflected an extended period of instability and insecurity. With so much uncertainty, could consumers be looking for help navigating a chaotic world with greater confidence? Generative AI could play an important role in giving banks predictive capabilities that could help their customers map out multiple financial scenarios to help make better choices. Today’s personalization efforts, looking at key transactional or web browsing attributes, may give way to more advanced ‘digital twins’, once only accessible to big tech, to reshape decision making. In a world of new possibilities, we could imagine a model is trained against a client’s persona to better predict how external forces and anticipated decision making could alter their financial future.

These trends are not full answers to where industries could go next. They can help us ask better questions, so our colleagues land at an idea that could set us up for success. Our people play a critical role in helping TD transform.

Through TD Invent, the Bank’s approach to innovation, we are encouraged to imagine the art of the possible and bring it to life through specialized processes. Our recent Gen AI virtual assistant to support our Canadian Contact Centre and virtual reality training pilot in branches were developed through the TD Invent approach.

We believe the possibilities are endless. The trust our TD customers place in us is central to our innovation philosophy, and our goal is to drive positive outcomes for our colleagues, customers and the communities we serve, that are fair, safe and transparent.

Architecting the Future: Building AI-Native Products in a Hybrid World

By Lee Ott, Vice President of AI Products, HP

At the heart of AI is the goal of elevating human potential. When technology manages mundane or repetitive tasks, we are free to focus on creativity, collaboration, and decision-making. By offloading routine tasks to AI, workflows that once took days can be completed in hours, enabling people to think bigger and move faster.

This shift from purely transactional tools to truly human-centric experiences underscores a core truth: One of technology’s most powerful purposes is to empower individuals, and by extension enterprises, while ensuring ethical, secure, and responsible innovation. AI’s real value lies in its ability to unlock new levels of productivity, spark innovation and drive responsible, human-centered progress.

Building for an AI-Native World

Traditionally, we learned to adapt to technology – memorizing arcane shortcuts and slogging through manual processes. In the AI-native era, we’re reversing that relationship. Today’s products are designed to adapt to us, understanding our workflows and preferences so seamlessly that we hardly notice the tech behind the scenes.

At HP, we’re evolving our hardware and software to ensure AI is embedded in a way that feels intuitive – enhancing what you do without adding friction. This includes everything from specialized chips for real-time processing to AI-driven applications that streamline everyday tasks.

Quantization and the Rise of Local AI

One of the most exciting developments in driving on-device AI is quantization. By reducing model size we can achieve near-instant responses without going to the cloud for everything. This leads to:

Lower Cost : Smaller models are more efficient, reducing both infrastructure and energy expenses.

: Smaller models are more efficient, reducing both infrastructure and energy expenses. Enhanced Privacy : Sensitive data stays on your device, which is crucial for regulated industries or personal information.

: Sensitive data stays on your device, which is crucial for regulated industries or personal information. Better User Experience: Local processing eliminates lag, resulting in real-time responsiveness for tasks like audio/video enhancements or instant translations.

Meanwhile, new silicon architectures are emerging to accommodate these streamlined models, allowing even mainstream PCs to deliver impressive AI performance at the edge.

From Models to Agents

For years, the conversation centered on building better models. Now, the focus is on agents – AI entities that proactively handle tasks for you. Instead of manually typing a prompt into a chatbot, you might imagine a PC that recognizes you’re in the middle of a project, automatically organizes your notes, sets calendar reminders, or drafts emails in the background.

Why AI Matters

Proactive Assistance : An AI PC will increasingly go beyond answering queries. It will assist users by intelligently anticipating needs, while reducing the steps needed for common workflows – always keeping the user in control of final decisions and actions.

It will assist users by intelligently anticipating needs, while reducing the steps needed for common workflows – always keeping the user in control of final decisions and actions. Contextual Awareness : By securely tapping local data – like your files or environment sensors – your PC will be able to act with an intimate understanding of your context. This ensures it is both helpful and highly personalized.

: By securely tapping local data – like your files or environment sensors – your PC will be able to act with an intimate understanding of your context. This ensures it is both helpful and highly personalized. Frictionless Productivity: From summarizing meeting transcripts to scheduling follow–ups, the user experience feels less like “using a computer” and more like collaborating with a capable partner.

Real-World Applications: AI PCs in Action

Seamless Collaboration

Tasks like background blur, live gesture detection, and real-time subtitles can all run locally, ensuring crisp video and audio while reducing latency. In a global call, you might be conversing in multiple languages with near–instant translation on your end.

Privacy–Sensitive Environments

Enterprise clients often deal with proprietary documents or employee data. Running specialized local models lets them reap the benefits of AI – like document summarization or note-taking – without risking data exposure to the public cloud.

Towards Hybrid Compute: Local and Cloud

While on-device AI continues to grow more capable – thanks to quantization and specialized silicon – there are times when you need broader, more intensive analysis. That’s where hybrid comes into play.

Rather than funneling all tasks through a single engine, AI-native products will leverage a flexible pipeline, ensuring that users have visibility and control over when tasks remain local and when cloud resources are securely utilized:

Local, Real-Time Tasks : Anything requiring instant response or heavy privacy – like filtering a live video feed – can run on–device.

: Anything requiring instant response or heavy privacy – like filtering a live video feed – can run on–device. Adaptive Cloud Offload: Larger or more complex analyses can be shifted seamlessly to the cloud (or on-prem devices) when needed, taking advantage of scalable compute resources.

This hybrid strategy optimizes performance, privacy, and cost. For example, you might do quick classification or summarization locally, then tap into more extensive cloud-based inference for deeper reasoning.

Overcoming Challenges Through Responsible Innovation

AI, especially when it’s proactive, brings its share of concerns – from privacy to transparency. At HP, our goal is not only to offer cutting-edge features but also to ensure they are grounded in trust and responsible design.

User Control : You decide what data is processed locally, when it goes to the cloud, and who has access. Clear toggles and settings put power in the hands of end users.

: You decide what data is processed locally, when it goes to the cloud, and who has access. Clear toggles and settings put power in the hands of end users. Transparent Data Practices : We design our products so you know what’s happening with your data. Whether it’s an on-device agent or a hybrid workflow, you have visibility and choice.

: We design our products so you know what’s happening with your data. Whether it’s an on-device agent or a hybrid workflow, you have visibility and choice. Regulatory Alignment: As regulations evolve, our hardware and software strategies evolve, too. By prioritizing secure enclaves, encryption, and compliance standards, we’re shaping AI systems that meet enterprise and consumer needs alike.

Looking Ahead: Designing AI for Humanity

As AI advances from passive models to agentic, ever-present partners, the goal remains clear: human augmentation. By freeing individuals from repetitive tasks and enabling them to focus on what truly matters, AI has the potential to transform everyday life and work.

Our focus at HP is to create AI-native products that intuitively adapt to you – tapping into local intelligence for speed and privacy, while harnessing elastic compute for scale. In this future, the question isn’t just “what can AI do?” but “how can AI seamlessly amplify the best of what you do?”

The more we embrace these shifts – quantization at the edge, agentic interfaces, and flexible hybrid architectures – the closer we get to AI that feels as natural as any other aspect of our world. And that, ultimately, is how technology becomes truly human-centric: by meeting us where we are, helping us grow, and making room for the creativity, connections, and innovations that only people can bring.

Don’t wait to join the AI Era. Meet the next generation of HP AI PCs, and experience more meaningful moments with AI solutions that adapt to you.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries and creating extraordinary opportunities for startups to thrive. For founders, AI offers vast potential—but maximizing that opportunity requires access to powerful, reliable, and affordable tools. This is where modern cloud computing proves invaluable.

Cloud infrastructure that integrates high throughput and low latency networking, storage, and the latest GPUs empowers startups to build, train, and deploy AI models without becoming distributed computing PhDs. These tools take on the heavy lifting, allowing founders to focus on solving meaningful problems, scaling their businesses, and bringing their ideas to life – faster.

As AI startups navigate a shifting landscape of privacy regulations, fierce competition for computing power, and pressure from industry incumbents, they face critical decisions about their infrastructure. Let’s explore the key considerations for success—and how Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) delivers unmatched value, end-to-end capabilities, and robust computing power to help startups build, serve, and scale their AI models and applications cost-effectively.

Enterprise-Grade AI Power for Startups on Demand

First, Oracle gives startups access to some of the world’s biggest AI clusters — comparable to those that Meta and xAI build for their own massive AI workloads. That brings a lot of power for startups to apply to their own workloads on a pay-as-they-go basis. Currently, companies such as Evidium, Inworld, Suno, and more are leveraging OCI AI infrastructure to deliver the computing power and performance they need to build their next-generation AI solutions. Use of OCI gives these startups a leg up if they want to work with the huge installed base of Oracle Database and Fusion Applications customers. In addition, OCI has startup accelerator programs which provides free credits for startups up to $100K, so startups can get more out of their investment while building cutting-edge new solutions.1

Scalability remains critical. OCI’s Zettascale cluster capability can offer aggregate network throughput of 100 petabytes per second with only microseconds of latency from machine-to-machine. This scale was unheard of in the industry until just a few months ago. By combining this high-powered network with OCI’s advanced storage solutions, startups can train models faster, run workloads more efficiently, and achieve a better total cost of ownership (TCO).

Run Faster, Pay Less

Cost is a big deal for small-but-growing companies, and the architecture you choose should deliver high performance while training and serving generative AI models cost-effectively. AI startups should look for infrastructure that’s optimized to run these workloads faster on a true pay-as-you-go pricing model—like OCI. Unlike others, OCI has the same low price globally, so you don’t have the overhead and complexity of picking from thousands of different compute SKUs. Remember, for startups as well as larger companies, the faster your jobs run, the less you pay.

Furthermore, OCI offers a complete platform that goes beyond just training models. Unlike GPU-only specialists, once you’re ready to launch your product, OCI provides the best value for hosting your model and applications. Or if you want to deploy the industry’s leading LLMs from Hugging Face, Meta, Mistral, and others for your own use you can do this via OCI Data Science with just a few clicks. By combining high-speed performance with a comprehensive suite of tools, OCI is uniquely positioned to help startups succeed in an increasingly competitive market.

Putting Security and Reliability at the Core

Security anchors our platform. Customer A’s data must never be accessible to Customer B—by accident or otherwise. Strong data isolation and clear policies govern how data is managed and used for training AI models, helping ensure trust and compliance. Being able to share a cluster network across multiple jobs run by a startup or a startup’s customers with strong isolation provides higher security, protects sensitive information, and enables startups to innovate with confidence. This foundation matters because the quality of data directly drives the quality of AI outcomes.

By building security and reliability into every layer of the platform Oracle ensures that startups can focus on developing cutting-edge AI solutions, and worry less about data breaches or compliance issues. Startups and enterprises alike trust Oracle’s infrastructure to safeguard their data while supporting their innovation goals.

Innovation Beyond GPUs: The Role of Resiliency, Networking and Distributed Cloud

Startups require an AI platform that minimizes the need to directly manage resources. What they need is a reliable, high-performance platform that gets the fundamentals right including a great network and great storage. Even minor failures in AI infrastructure disrupt workflows and waste valuable resources. OCI mitigates these risks with robust fault-tolerant architecture, which ensures developers can focus on solving critical business challenges instead of troubleshooting interruptions.

Of course, raw compute power is key, but AI workloads depend on more than the fastest GPUs. Networking also plays a critical role, and Oracle introduced innovations that streamline those technologies.

Take RoCE or RDMA over Converged Ethernet networking for example. RDMA has powered Oracle Exadata databases for decades, and we were the first to run multi-tenant workloads on RoCE—even before AI became mainstream. By applying optimized RoCE to enable seamless communication across tens of thousands of GPUs, we can deliver multiple gigaflops of performance per cluster, giving startups the efficiency and scalability needed. We also support InfiniBand networking for use cases such as AI training that require ultra-low latency to offer our customers choices in leading networking technologies. In addition, Oracle works closely with partners and industry leaders, driving standards through initiatives like UEC to deliver the best performance for AI workloads.

For over a decade, cloud providers focused on delivering cloud services in a handful of public cloud regions. OCI changed that equation by making full cloud services available for specific governments, for the EU, and even on-premises. This provides new ways for AI startups to provide their services and for customers to consume them. OCI’s deployment options—which allow companies to run their cloud services securely in a sovereign cloud setting—are attractive to startups targeting markets with strict data location and privacy requirements.

Startups like Fireworks AI are already leveraging these innovations. By using OCI’s high-performance AI solutions with industry-leading RDMA networking, the startup is building a hyper-optimized inferencing engine to help other startups maximize the value of their GPUs—an essential step in deploying AI models efficiently.

Unlocking the Transformative Potential of Cloud AI

Think about the transition from the Yellow Pages to Google Search—a revolution that drastically sped access to information, whether it was finding a restaurant or mapping out the fastest route. Cloud-enabled AI takes this transformation much further. It doesn’t just save time; it effectively shrinks the time it takes to perform complex tasks and creates entirely new possibilities. AI agents can now collaborate with each other to solve complex problems across industries, enabling faster research, deeper insights into behaviors, and improved trend analysis.

This rapid pace of innovation requires robust cloud infrastructure to sustain growth. With OCI, startups have access to the same versatile and cost-effective tools leveraged by the world’s leading enterprises. This enables these businesses to focus on their core vision, without the distractions of managing hardware or worrying about prohibitive costs.

Most founders spend their time thinking about product-market fit and customer acquisition strategies. But there’s a critical foundation that often gets overlooked: the legal structure of your company. Get this wrong, and you might find yourself unable to raise capital, regardless of your startup’s potential.

Having raised over $130M across multiple companies — first with Reflektive (acquired) and now with Every — I’ve seen how early incorporation decisions can significantly impact a startup’s ability to raise capital. The process isn’t particularly complex, but it requires attention to specific details that many first-time founders miss.

Leave your job first

You must leave your current position before incorporating your new startup. The primary reason is intellectual property rights — most employment contracts have broad IP assignment clauses that could give your employer claims to your startup’s IP. While there may be legal workarounds to this situation, they require careful navigation with an experienced startup attorney. It is very risky to try to figure this out on your own. For most founders, the decision to leave and incorporate a startup typically arrives at one of two critical moments: either when you’ve secured your first customer, or when an investor expresses serious interest. These triggers often provide the concrete validation needed to leave your former career behind and make the leap to being a founder.

Incorporate in Delaware as a C-Corp

VCs and angel investors will only invest in Delaware C-Corporations. Period. Try to pitch them an LLC or a corporation registered in another state, and you’ll likely get a hard pass before they even look at your business metrics.

Why? C-Corporations provide the standard share issuance and governance structure that investors require. And Delaware isn’t just another state choice — it’s the gold standard, offering investor-friendly tax laws, robust legal protections, and clear corporate governance guidelines that VCs understand inside and out. Nearly half of all publicly traded companies in the U.S. are incorporated in Delaware for good reason.

While you can technically restructure your company later, it’s an expensive and time-consuming process that can derail funding rounds. Starting with a Delaware C-Corp from day one removes this potential roadblock.

Structure your stock to maximize your returns

Let’s talk about structuring your founder shares strategically. While there are certain terms investors won’t budge on — like a 4-year vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff — there’s room to optimize the structure in your favor.

Here’s a founder-friendly move that most investors will be ok with: the double trigger acceleration clause. This provision accelerates your vesting if two things happen: your company gets acquired, and you’re terminated. Without this protection, you could find yourself pushed out with a significant portion of your equity still unvested. With it, you maintain leverage in acquisition scenarios and protect your upside. Smart investors understand and accept this term, so don’t leave it on the table.

Use incorporation docs that are built for tech startups

A costly mistake I often see founders make: using incorporation documents with generic instead of startup-specific verbiage. When investors conduct due diligence, they’ll expect to see startup-specific clauses in your incorporation documents. If your paperwork doesn’t match what they’re used to, you’ll end up spending thousands in legal fees to restructure everything.

At Every, we’ve built our incorporation documents specifically for this purpose — setting up your company to be investible while maximizing founder returns. Like everything else we do, these documents have been crafted based on our experience operating multiple tech startups. We handle all the setup work to ensure your documentation matches exactly what tech investors expect to see.

Across the world, women and girls remain disproportionately affected by the negative impacts of climate change. While it remains a global phenomenon that impacts everyone on the planet to some degree, female health, education and economic opportunities are all hit harder than those pertaining to men.

Despite this heavier burden, women are also frequently left out of the climate conversation, with fewer opportunities to contribute their views, perspectives, resources and talents towards finding equitable solutions for this collective crisis. A recent UN Gender Composition Report found that across the top-level climate decision-making, negotiations, advice and technical bodies, women’s voices are rarely given equal representation.

Fortunately, the tide is turning. As emerging technologies and new business practices are integrated into the global economy, they are opening more avenues for female participation in combatting climate change. Nowhere is this change on display more tangibly than in the tech-based startup scene, where women innovators, entrepreneurs and business leaders are making their presence felt.

Why are women integral to the Climate Startup Scene?

After a long history of male domination, female voices, leadership, ideas and investments are entering the broader global startup ecosystem, particularly regarding climate-facing solutions. Female leadership is essential here because emerging research suggests that companies run by women not only generate more revenue but also invest more in R&D, while creating more inclusive and engaged workforces.

At a point in history where time is of the essence to forge more equitable and sustainable solutions to the interconnected parts of the climate crisis, this kind of innovative, inclusive leadership is vital to secure better results, faster.

As well as tangible results in the field, female leadership and inclusion at every level of the climate discission also makes a crucial difference when we’re talking about money – the lubricant of all progress on addressing climate change. By 2026, private equity firms will control an estimated $11 trillion in managed assets, meaning that they hold the key to supporting or stymying the world’s transition to a truly sustainable economy.

Female leadership is an essential part of the equation here. Not only do female success stories inspire other women to venture into entrepreneurship and innovation-based fields, they also perpetuate an investment cycle into more sustainable assets and outcomes. Female-led venture capitalist firms are more likely to invest in lower-polluting sectors and enterprises, and they are more likely to invest in other female-led organisations. Sustainable Ventures, a European climate tech hub, has almost a quarter of its capital (23%) invested in all-female founding teams, a full 12 times more than the industry average of just 1.8%.

When women reach leadership positions in financial institutions and in tech-led enterprises, they are more likely to support other ventures looking for similar outcomes. Their success reinforces that of others, while opening doors for new market entrants, further accelerating the spread of sustainable innovations and capital flows.

As artificial intelligence becomes prevalent, everything can be augmented. We’re seeing a shift from humans working on computers, to humans and AI working together.

AI definitely has the potential to transform industries including healthcare, improving cognitive abilities, providing sensory inputs, and of course, enabling continuous monitoring in offering real-time feedback, AI augmentation turns potentiality into possibility.

A recent report by Statista suggested that the global AI market is expected to show an annual growth rate of 27.67% (2025-2030), resulting in a market volume of US$826.70 billion by 2030, highlighting the immense potential of AI augmentation encompassing the substantial demands for technological advancements. Say, smart glasses that enable intuitive interaction between the user and the world; objects respond to touches with haptic feedback and an immersive experience; or, devices that detect our subtle changes in mental state then provide personalized guidance, the possibilities are endless.

These were largely science fiction – until CES 2025 brings us closer to a future, where startups take off from Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP) towards the international stage, where Human-AI symbiosis become a reality.

Surcharge View with Gen AI

AirGo Vision, a pair of smart glasses set to unveil its fifth-generation powered by OpenAI’s frontier model GPT-4o, enabling seamless, hands-free interaction for users to ask questions and receive answers effortlessly, a search engine on-the-go, so to speak.

Solos Technology, based in Hong Kong, leverages the power of multimodal LLM, AirGo Vision can now capture images and provide illustrative insights that were previously unavailable. Other notable features include real-time translation, voice-activated commands, and instant access to real-time information.

Kenny Cheung, CEO of Solos, explains that rather than pull out a phone to take a photo or type in a query, your glasses see what you see, allowing them access and process context at a moment’s notice; and within its ingenious design, all electronics are tightly integrated into the temple arms, allowing for interchangeable frames with type-C connectors that can be easily swapped out, as Solos mastered miniaturization.

While technological advancements are crucial, they’re not enough to guarantee success if consumers don’t find Solos’ glasses “cute” or comfortable to wear. It’s been given a chance with Hong Kong’s expertise in both electronics and eyewear industries for the smart glasses to balance aesthetics and aptitude, and to allow personalization without compromising functionality for flexibility.

Hong Kong’s prototyping ecosystem is regarded for its agility, granting Solos the resources to iterate rapidly in refining its smart glasses, going to market sooner, and getting acceptance faster for further growth.

AI: Let There be Touch

While the smart glasses shed light on how we will communicate with the world, there are touch sensors that allow simpler interaction with machine.

Founded in the UK and now also headquartered in Hong Kong, TG0 is a pioneer in the hardware front of AI technologies, enabling control with a flick or dab that applies across sectors, from automotive to medical devices and consumer electronics, machine learning transforms conductive polymers into novel sensing technology, and designers are encouraged to reimagine product designs in making a stark contrast to be rid of traditional touch sensors that rely heavily on rigid materials and complex electronic assemblies with multiple layers.

By developing algorithms that can run on tiny AI chips, which detect not just touch, but recognize gestures, deformation, and nuanced pressure, interpreting signals generated when and where the material is touched across the surface, TG0 fundamentally change how users could interact with devices. The solution is also environmentally friendly as it reduces the need for electronic components, minimizing environmental footprint. Co-founder Liucheng Guo, a renowned expert in AI software and hardware design, believes that Hong Kong offers an ideal blend of research and development opportunities, as well as access to key markets for expansion.

Life Coaching with AI-empowered Perspective

So we’ve developed that AI can sense a touch, but when paired with IoT, AI can even “sense” human behavior. PieX, an AI-powered pendant designed by a team of researchers at ThingX in Hong Kong, offering new perspectives with AIoT, on understanding one’s mental state, serving as a personal life coach, and shouldering the emotional load.

As CEO Bob Zhao explains, ‘In today’s world, where our memories are dispersed across multiple apps and devices, PieX brings a holistic view that aggregates and contextualizes memories, habits, and activities, making sense out of signals given from conversations and vital signs, while mulling over patterns in emotional fluctuations that leads to self-discovery. At the heart of the solution is an app that runs locally on smartphones, providing actionable insights regardless of whether users are navigating uncertainty on a challenging day, or seeking solace during stressful moments, personalized support and guidance to calmness and energy is found with PieX.

Seeing is believing

These startups are testament to the comprehensive incubation programmes at HKSTP providing mentorship, funding support, infrastructure and global connections that introduce “augmented” ideas to reality, and taking center stage at this year’s CES to give a preview on our future, driven by AI.

Digital health solutions have revolutionized patient care, enabling non-invasive, connected, and personalized healthcare delivery. The global healthcare market is projected to reach USD 44,760.73 Billion by 2032, growing from USD 21,222.5 Billion in 2023.

With the vast potential of the healthcare industry, Hong Kong is poised to capitalize on this trend by leveraging technology to improve healthcare outcomes, that harness its excellence in academic research, industrial partnerships, and strategic collaboration to accelerate the translation of research into applications

The Sweat That Unveils

As the wearable technology landscape continues to evolve, a new player is emerging with sweat-sensing tech that disrupts athlete health and biomolecule monitoring.

PointFit‘s proprietary nanomembrane skin patch harnesses expertise from a multidisciplinary team of local researchers, delivers accurate sweat analysis, and enables detection of specific biomarkers and vital biomolecule data, which were previously inaccessible to wearables.

Before sweat analysis becomes a reality, professional athletes has the endurance of steel undergoing frequent blood pricking to determine their lactate levels for optimal training. By integrating sensors into a sport wristband, PointFit is able to change this and democratize lactate detection with non-invasive and affordable wearable technology.

“The sensor detects continuous changes in lactate levels, providing actionable insights into fatigue, muscle cramping, or oxygen deprivation – crucial information for athletes seeking to mitigate injury risk.” Explained Kenny Oktavius, Co-Founder & CEO of PointFit.” We team up with sport scientists from Hong Kong Baptist University to enable early detection and intervention of heart failure in endurance sports, where timely action can be a lifesaver.”

However, PointFit’s potential extends far beyond sport science. Its modular design enables sensor swaps, allowing for the collection of a diverse range of biomarkers – from stress hormones to glucose, the platform is opening doors to new frontiers in health and wellness.

“We’re already exploring its application in chronic disease monitoring, precautionary diagnostics and medial fields, and we’re eager to expand our reach into the US market, a showcase at CES could be just the leg-up for it to work.”

Oktavius, a researcher at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), also shares why a “homegrown” technology carries special meaning to him. “We started out at HKSTP’s Incubation Programme in 2020,” Oktavius notes, “their support has been invaluable to our growth and what’s even more meaningful, is knowing that our technology is rooted in the local ecosystem, a testament to research excellence and eminence.”

The shortage of psychiatric professionals being a significant barrier, the healthtech advocate is collaborating with local medical schools to develop an innovative AI-powered counselling platform featuring personal assessments, mindfulness content, and personalized distractions in an immersive environment that ensure confidentiality.

“EneHUB is a point-of-care solution designed specifically for the healthcare industry and local corporations are also seeking to improve their employees’ wellness through our solutions.” Jonathan Linstow, Director of Business Development at ATG, said: “We’re looking for strategic partners who have experience, gathering valuable insights from others ensures that we create something that truly meets user needs.”

In Hong Kong, collaboration between establishments are the catalysts for innovation, creating a vibrant ecosystem of industry leaders, researchers, and entrepreneurs, and setting off this chain reaction that empowers a new generation of innovators. The Hong Kong Tech Pavilion at Eureka Park and Global Pavilion, with 51 rooted-in-Hong-Kong tech companies and institution, is ready to illustrate that notion.

Innovation is complex. But it doesn’t have to be complicated.

At CES 2025, 3M is demonstrating how it transforms intricate technical challenges into elegant solutions for some of the world’s leading brands. With over 120 years of expertise in materials science and a culture of hands-on collaboration, 3M delivers novel and scalable innovations that push boundaries across various industries.

Collaborative Innovation

3M goes beyond merely supplying materials; it works side-by-side with customers, embedding expertise directly into their operations. By addressing custom challenges and anticipating future needs, 3M helps partners like GM and Lenovo turn ambitious ideas into tangible breakthroughs.

“I like to say we’re a technology integration company that manufactures products,” says Mike Kesti, Senior Vice President of Corporate R&D at 3M. Whether developing a sophisticated component for a foldable laptop or creating everyday essentials like Post-it® Notes, 3M excels in combining unique materials and advanced manufacturing techniques to solve complex challenges.

Robotics and Auto Manufacturing with GM

At the core of 3M’s approach is a commitment to collaboration. Unlike companies that focus on selling pre-made products, 3M works directly with partners to understand their most demanding challenges. This allows 3M to address immediate needs and broader industry trends.

For example, GM’s auto production once relied on labor-intensive, hand-finishing paint applications. 3M engineers partnered with GM to develop an automated system combining advanced robotics with proprietary abrasives. The result was a faster, more consistent process that addressed workforce shortages and improved quality. By embedding engineers on-site, 3M tailored the solution to GM’s operations, setting a new benchmark for automotive manufacturing.

More than a decade ago, researchers at antivirus company Kaspersky identified suspicious internet traffic of what they thought was a known government-backed group, based on similar targeting and its phishing techniques. Soon, the researchers realized they had found a much more advanced hacking operation that was targeting the Cuban government, among others.

Eventually the researchers were able to attribute the network activity to a mysterious — and at the time completely unknown — Spanish-speaking hacking group that they called Careto, after the Spanish slang word (“ugly face” or “mask” in English), which they found buried within the malware’s code.

Careto was never publicly linked to a specific government. But TechCrunch has now learned that the researchers who first discovered the group were convinced that Spanish government hackers were behind Careto’s espionage operations.

When Kaspersky first revealed the existence of Careto in 2014, its researchers called the group “one of the most advanced threats at the moment,” with its stealthy malware capable of stealing highly sensitive data, including private conversations and keystrokes from the computers it compromised, much akin to powerful government spyware today. Careto’s malware was used to hack into government institutions and private companies around the world.

Kaspersky avoided publicly blaming who it thought was behind Careto. But internally, according to several people who worked at Kaspersky at the time and had knowledge of the investigation, its researchers concluded that Careto was a hacking team working for the Spanish government.

“There was no doubt of that, at least no reasonable [doubt],” one of the former employees told TechCrunch, who like other sources in this story agreed to speak on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.

Careto is one of only a handful of Western government hacking groups that has ever been discussed in public, along with U.S. government units such as Equation Group, widely believed to be the U.S. National Security Agency; the Lamberts, believed to be the CIA; and the French government group known as Animal Farm, which was behind the Babar and Dino malware. In a rare admission, Bernard Barbier, former head of the French intelligence service DGSE, publicly confirmed the French government was indeed behind Babar.

The Spanish government now joins this small group of Western government hacking groups.

Early in its investigation, Kaspersky discovered that the Careto hackers had targeted a particular government network and systems in Cuba, according to a second former Kaspersky employee.

It was this Cuban government victim that sparked Kaspersky’s investigation into Careto, according to the people speaking with TechCrunch.

“It all started with a guy who worked for the Cuban government who got infected,” the third former Kaspersky employee, with knowledge of the Careto investigation, told TechCrunch. The person, who referred to the Cuban government victim as “patient zero,” said that it appeared the Careto hackers were interested in Cuba because during that time there were members of the Basque terrorist organization ETA in the country.

Kaspersky researchers noted in a technical report published after their discovery that Cuba had by far the most number of victims per country at the time of the investigation into Careto’s activities, specifically one unnamed Cuban government institution, which the report said showed “the current interest of the attackers.”

This Cuban government victim would prove key to link Careto to Spain, according to the former Kaspersky employees.

“Internally we knew who did it,” the third former Kaspersky employee said, adding that they had “high confidence” it was the Spanish government. Two other former Kaspersky employees, who also had knowledge of the investigation, said the researchers likewise concluded Spain was behind the attacks.

The company, however, decided not to disclose it. “It wasn’t broadcast because I think they didn’t want to out a government like that,” a fourth former Kaspersky researcher said. “We had a strict ‘no attribution’ policy at Kaspersky. Sometimes that policy was stretched but never broken.”

Apart from Cuba, other Careto targets also pointed to Spain. The espionage operation affected hundreds of victims in Brazil, Morocco, Spain itself and — perhaps tellingly — Gibraltar, the disputed British enclave on the Iberian peninsula that Spain has long claimed as its own territory.

Kaspersky declined to answer questions about its researchers’ conclusions.

“We don’t engage in any formal attribution,” Kaspersky spokesperson Mai Al Akkad told TechCrunch in an email.

The Spanish Ministry of Defense declined to comment. The Cuban government did not respond to emails sent to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The discovery of Careto

After Kaspersky discovered the group’s malware in 2014 and, as a result, learned how to identify other computers compromised by it, the researchers found evidence of Careto infections all over the world, compromising victims in 31 countries spanning several continents.

In Africa, the group’s malware was found in Algeria, Morocco, and Libya; in Europe, it targeted victims in France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In Latin America, there were victims in Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, and Venezuela.

In its technical report, Kaspersky said that Cuba had the most victims that were being targeted, with “all belonging to the same institution,” which the researchers perceived as of significance to the hackers at that point in time.

Spain had its own particular interest in Cuba in the preceding years. As an exiled Cuban government official told the Spanish daily El Pais at the end of 2013, there were around 15 members of the terror group ETA who lived in Cuba with the approval of the local government. In 2014, a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable noted that Cuba had given refuge to ETA terrorists for years. Earlier in 2010, a Spanish judge ordered the arrest of ETA members living in Cuba.

When covering the news of the discovery of Careto, the Spanish online news outlet El Diario noted that targeting countries such as Brazil and Gibraltar would favor the Spanish government’s “geostrategic interests.” The Spanish government had been pushing for a consortium of government-owned and private companies to win a bid to build a high-speed railway in Brazil from Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo.

Aside from targeting government institutions, embassies, and diplomatic organizations, Kaspersky said the Careto group also targeted energy companies, research institutions, and activists.

Kaspersky researchers wrote that they were able to find evidence that the Careto malware existed as far back as 2007, and found subsequent versions of Careto capable of exploiting Windows PCs, Macs, and Linux computers. The researchers said they found possible evidence of code capable of targeting Android devices and iPhones.

While Kaspersky didn’t make its internal attribution public, its researchers left clear hints that pointed to Spain.

First, the company researchers noted that they found a string in the malware code that was particularly interesting: “Caguen1aMar.” That string is a contraction for the popular Spanish expletive, “me cago en la mar,” which literally means “I sh–t in the sea,” but roughly translates to “f—k,” a phrase typically used in Spain, and not in other Spanish-speaking countries.

When Kaspersky announced its discovery of Careto in 2014, the company published a map showing all the countries that the hacking group had targeted. Along with the map, Kaspersky included an illustration of a mask with bull’s horns and a nose ring (the bull is a national symbol of Spain), castanets or clackers (an instrument used in Spanish folk music), and the red and yellow colors of the Spanish flag.

A detail in the map revealed how important Cuba was for Careto. For certain countries, Kaspersky added icons specifying what type of targets it was able to identify. The map showed Cuba had a single hacked victim, marked as a government institution. Gibraltar, Morocco — whose proximity and territorial disputes make it a strategic espionage target for Spain — and Switzerland were the only other territories with a government victim.

Kaspersky said in 2014 that the Careto group’s malware was one of the “most advanced threats” of the time for its ability to grab highly sensitive data from a victim’s computer. Kaspersky said the malware could also intercept internet traffic, Skype conversations, encryption (PGP) keys, and VPN configurations, take screenshots, and “fetch all information from Nokia devices.”

The Careto group relied in large part on spearphishing emails that contained malicious links impersonating Spanish newspapers like El País, El Mundo, and Público, and videos about political subjects and food recipes. One of the former Kaspersky employees told TechCrunch that the phishing links also included references to ETA and Basque news, which Kaspersky’s report omitted.

When clicking on these malicious links, the victim would get infected using an exploit that hacked the user’s specific device, then redirected to a legitimate web page so as to not raise suspicions, according to Kaspersky’s report.

The Careto operators also took advantage of a since-patched vulnerability in older versions of Kaspersky’s antivirus software, which the company said in its 2014 published report was how it first discovered the malware.

The ubiquity of Kaspersky’s software in Cuba effectively made it possible for Careto to target almost anyone on the island with an internet connection. (By 2018, the Russian antivirus company controlled some 90% of the island’s internet security market, according to Cuba Standard, an independent news website.) The antivirus is so popular across the country that the company’s name has become part of the local slang.

But soon after Kaspersky published its research, the Careto hackers shut down all of its operations discovered by the Russian firm, going as far as wiping its logs, which researchers noted was “not very common” and put Careto into the “elite” section of government hacking groups.

“You can’t do that if you’re not prepared,” one of the former Kaspersky employees told TechCrunch. “They systematically, and in a quick manner, destroyed the whole thing, the whole infrastructure. Boom. It was just gone.”

Careto gets caught again

After Careto went dark, neither Kaspersky nor any other cybersecurity company publicly reported detecting Careto again — until last year.

Kaspersky announced in May 2024 that it had found Careto’s malware once again, saying it saw the group target an unnamed organization in Latin America that was “previously compromised” by the hacking group most recently in 2022, again in 2019, and on another occasion more than 10 years ago.

Careto also hacked a second unnamed organization, located in Central Africa, said Kaspersky.

In a blog post later in December 2024, Kaspersky’s researchers attributed the new hacks to Careto “with medium to high confidence,” based in part on filenames that were “alarmingly similar” to filenames found in Careto’s activities from a decade ago, as well as overlapping tactics, techniques, and procedures, or TTPs, a cybersecurity expression that refers to the unique behaviors of a certain hacking group.

Kaspersky researchers Georgy Kucherin and Marc Rivero López, who wrote a paper and presented their research at the Virus Bulletin security conference in October 2024, said Careto “has always conducted cyber attacks with extreme caution,” but still “managed to make small but fatal mistakes during their recent operations” that matched activity from Careto a decade earlier.

Despite that, Kucherin told TechCrunch that they don’t know who, or which government, is behind the Careto hacking group.

“It’s likely a nation state,” said Kucherin. “But what entity it was, who developed the malware? From a technical perspective, it’s impossible to tell.”

According to Kaspersky’s most recent report, this time the Careto hackers broke into the unnamed Latin American victim’s email server and then planted its malware.

In one of the hacked machines the researchers analyzed, Kaspersky found that Careto’s malware could surreptitiously switch on the computer’s microphone (while hiding the Windows icon that normally alerts the user that the mic is on), steal files, such as personal documents, session cookies that can allow access to accounts without needing a password, web browsing histories from several browsers, and more.

In the case of another victim, according to the report, Careto hackers used a set of implants that work as a backdoor, a keylogger, and a screenshot-taker.

Despite the fact that they got caught, and compared to what Kaspersky found more than a decade ago, Kucherin said that the Careto hackers are “still that good.”

Compared to the larger and more well-known government-backed hacking groups, like the North Korean Lazarus Group and China’s APT41, Kucherin said Careto is a “very small [advanced persistent threat] that surpasses all those large ones in complexity.”

“Their attacks are a masterpiece,” said Kucherin.

Here’s what is on tap for tomorrow. Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov is scheduled to talk. No word on what Dolgov will talk about but he’ll surely mention this milestone that was posted on X today: Waymo has now officially served over 10 million fully autonomous paid rides — doubling its total from the end of last year.

Tomorrow’s I/O agenda is packed, including sessions covering Google’s Gemma family of open AI models, Google Workspace, and Android development tools. We’re expecting lots of demos, as well as possibly a few surprises that weren’t announced during the Tuesday keynotes.

Nvidia announced Thursday it’s partnering with EPRI, a power industry R&D organization, to use AI to solve problems facing the electrical grid. Perhaps ironically, the issues are largely caused by rising power demand from AI itself.

The Open Power AI Consortium, which includes a number of electrical utilities and tech companies, says it will use domain-specific AI models to devise new ways to tackle problems that the power industry is predicted to face in the coming years. The models will be open sourced and available to researchers across academia and industry.

The power industry is facing surging demand from data centers in the United States and elsewhere as AI ramps up the need for computing power. Electricity demand is expected to grow by 4% annually in the coming years, according to the International Energy Agency, nearly double over 2023 figures.

Singer, songwriter, and leader of Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) John Fogerty is apparently keeping up with the times. During his SXSW keynote on Wednesday in Austin, Texas, the musician joked about using ChatGPT to determine which songs to play for his shows.

In an interview conducted by Tom Morello (of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave), Fogerty was asked how he decided on a setlist for a given evening, like his concert at SXSW the previous night.

“I just go on ChatGPT or whatever,” Fogerty said, leading the audience to howl with laughter.

He then added that “you learn a whole lot trying to be an entertainer,” and said he just wanted people to have fun at the concert. “I want them to join in. I want them to sing along.”

The interview also touched on CCR history, music publishing rights, and the stories behind some of the band’s songs, among other things.

At one point, Fogerty also pointed out how the medium we use to consume music defines how it’s presented.

“Songs have always sort of been manifested by the medium that they’re on. I mean, the three-minute song or so was invented because of the 78 record. You just couldn’t put more stuff in there,” he said. Then the LP came along and CDs, which led to people having albums with far more songs, even 19- or 21-track albums.” (He said he didn’t think this was a great idea, for what it’s worth, adding that “after six or seven songs, put it on the next record!”)

Today, the medium we use to consume music is streaming, which means that distribution is in some ways more democratic, Morello said, although there’s less of a funnel as thousands of new songs are released daily.

CCR has over a billion streams, however, which Fogerty said was “magical and remarkable.”

“If your song is streamed, especially to a great degree, it means that young people are listening to it, because that’s their media: streaming,” he said.

DeepSeek crashed Nvidia’s stock last week based on speculation that its cheaper AI models would dramatically decrease Big Tech’s spending on things like data centers and GPUs.

But Alphabet has joined Meta in doubling down on AI spending, pledging to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures this year to accelerate its AI ambitions — well over analyst estimates of $59 billion.

“We are confident about the opportunities ahead, and to accelerate our progress, we expect to invest approximately $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company’s earnings results.

Alphabet spent about $52 billion in capex for 2024, according to Reuters, so the new number represents a huge 42% increase.

Both Meta and Alphabet are betting that cheaper AI will massively boost demand for their services, rather than making it basically free for everyone and threatening their business models.

F ifty years ago the last Americans were evacuated from Saigon, leaving behind a war-ravaged and impoverished country. Today Saigon, renamed Ho Chi Minh City, is a metropolis of over 9m people full of skyscrapers and flashy brands. You might think this is the moment to celebrate Vietnam’s triumph: its elimination of severe poverty; its ranking as one of the ten top exporters to America; its role as a manufacturing hub for firms like Apple and Samsung. In fact Vietnam has trouble in store. To avoid it—and show whether emerging economies can still join the developed world—Vietnam will need to pull off a second miracle. It must find new ways to get rich despite the trade war, and the hard man in charge must turn himself into a reformer.

T he African family is under threat. That, at least, was the message of the “Pan-African Conference on Family Values” held in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, this month. Delegates from across Africa as well as several from Western countries described a continent on the cusp of social collapse. Attendees were told that “foreign ideologies” were producing an epidemic of abortion, homosexuality and “gender confusion”. One of the Kenyan organisers blamed incest on sex education. Everyone agreed their liberal opponents were on the march. “The people on the other side who are pushing this agenda are relentless,” declared David Oginde, chair of Kenya’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.

T he leaders of the Communist Party might be surprised to find they are indebted to a bouncy 20-year-old livestreamer from Ohio called Darren Watkins junior. He goes by the screen name “IShowSpeed” and has in one visit done more for China’s image abroad than any amount of turgid party propaganda. On a two-week trip in March and April he showed his 38m followers the country’s rich history (with a backflip on the Great Wall), friendly people (he joked with China’s finest Donald Trump impersonator) and advanced technology (he danced with a humanoid robot, had a kfc meal delivered by drone, and tried a flying taxi). As he drove into a lake in Shenzhen, safe within an amphibious James-Bond-style electric SUV , Mr Watkins was agog. “Oh my God, this car is not sinking…China got it, these Chinese cars got it!” Or, as he says frequently throughout his visit, “China’s different, bro.”

S EEN THROUGH the cold lens of statistics, Joe Biden’s statement on May 18th that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer is not all that surprising. In America prostate cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed sort behind breast cancer. (In England it takes the top spot.) Around one man in eight will be diagnosed in their lifetimes. As with most cancers age is the biggest risk, though family history and black ethnicity are others. Younger men can get unlucky and suffer, too. In 2024 Sir Chris Hoy, a British Olympic cyclist, announced that he had an aggressive and terminal form of the disease. Ultra-fit and aged just 48 at the time, Sir Chris was not, on the face of it, at high risk.

T he night the United States Institute of Peace ( USIP ) was taken over, March 17th, staffers from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) walked round its headquarters smoking cigars and drinking beers while they dismantled the signage and disabled the computer systems. The takeover of the USIP building in Washington, DC , earlier that afternoon was one of the more notable moments of President Donald Trump’s revolution in the capital, because the think-tank is not actually part of the executive branch. The Institute’s board and president, George Moose, a veteran diplomat, were summarily fired. He and other senior staff were ultimately forced out of the building at the behest of three different police agencies. Then a DOGE staffer handed over the keys to the building to the federal government.

A ccept, for a moment, Joe Biden’s contention that he is mentally as sharp as ever. Then try to explain some revelations of the books beginning to appear about his presidency: that he never held a formal meeting to discuss whether to run for a second term; that he never heard directly from his own pollsters about his dismal public standing, or anything else; that by 2024 most of his own cabinet secretaries had no contact with him; that, when he was in Washington, he would often eat dinner at 4.30pm and vanish into his private quarters by 5.15; that when he travelled, he often skipped briefings while keeping a morning appointment with a makeup artist to cover his wrinkles and liver spots. You might think that Mr Biden—that anyone—would welcome as a rationale that he had lost a step or two. It is a kinder explanation than the alternatives: vanity, hubris, incompetence.

D URING WALMART’S latest earnings call on May 15th, Doug McMillon stated the obvious. “The higher tariffs will result in higher prices,” the big-box behemoth’s chief executive told analysts, referring to Donald Trump’s levies on imports of just about anything from just about anywhere. Who’d have thought? Two days later the president weighed in with an alternative idea. Walmart (and China, where many of those imports come from) should “ EAT THE TARIFFS ” , he posted on social media. Mr McMillon did not respond publicly to the suggestion. But it is likely to be a polite, lower-case “Thanks, but no thanks.”

I N DOLLAR TERMS , America’s defence budget still towers over the rest—it is bigger than those of the next nine countries combined. But such comparisons reveal little about what that money buys. Armed with fresh estimates from SIPRI , a Stockholm-based think-tank, our annual ranking compares military spending in three ways: raw dollar totals, share of GDP and military purchasing-power parity (military PPP ). This last measure adjusts for wage and price differences to make other countries’ spending more directly comparable with America’s. (We leave equipment costs unchanged, as much of the hardware is imported and its quality is hard to compare.) Our analysis shows that America’s lead is not as large as the raw numbers suggest.

A MERICA’S MEASLES outbreak is alarming for several reasons. What began as a handful of cases in Texas in January has now surpassed 800 across several states, with many more cases probably going unreported. It is the worst outbreak in 30 years and has already killed three people. Other smaller outbreaks bring the total number of cases recorded in 2025 so far to over 1,000. But above all, public-health experts worry that the situation now is a sign of worse to come. Falling vaccination rates and cuts to public-health services could make such outbreaks more frequent and impossible to curb, eventually making measles endemic in the country again.

I N GREEK MYTHology Prometheus stole fire from the gods and brought it to Earth. He paid for that by being bound for eternity to a rock face, where an eagle tormented him daily by pecking at his liver. Such was the price of humanity’s first great technology. In the 21st century the story of Sam Altman, the co-founder and chief executive of Open AI , has a Promethean ring to it, too. He spearheaded the creation of Chat GPT , which was launched in late 2022, stunning the world: suddenly the revolutionary capabilities and risks of generative artificial intelligence ( AI ) were unleashed. A year later the capricious gods—that is to say, Open AI ’s non-profit board—sought to banish him. Unlike Prometheus, however, Mr Altman emerged unscathed.

“I will sell all of this gold and move back to Syria by the spring,” Ousama Sabbagh enthused in his jewellery shop in a majority-Syrian district in the Turkish city of Bursa, south of Istanbul. That was five months ago. Today his shop looks little different than it did then. Mr Sabbagh now wants to move in September, cheered by President Donald Trump’s recent pledge to lift America’s sanctions against Syria. That decision has given new hope to Syrians abroad, says Dr Haytham Alhamwi of the Syrian British Consortium, a lobby. Business folk in the diaspora think sanctions relief and international aid are vital for rebuilding the country and making it safe.

F ans and foes of this week’s agreement between Britain and the European Union have made hugely exaggerated claims about it. Sir Keir Starmer heralded it as historic and the start of a new era. The prime minister’s opponents accused him of betraying Brexit or of killing it altogether. The truth is that the deal sensibly, if modestly, reduces some of the worst trade frictions introduced after Britain’s exit from the EU five years ago. And it adds a new pact to work together on rebuilding Europe’s defences, an urgent task given Russian aggression and American equivocation. But this “reset” is neither historic nor an act of betrayal. Brexit remains “hard”.

T he trends outlined in this report have transformed finance. Many of them will only intensify. Private-equity firms will keep diversifying away from buy-outs into lending and life insurance. Hedge funds will continue consolidating and reaping the benefits of scale. The brain drain from banks to hedge funds and other asset managers will carry on. So will the quest of some on Wall Street to rip off Main Street. The craze in cryptocurrencies and leveraged exchange-traded funds is already making the meme-stock madness of 2021 look quaint by comparison. President Donald Trump, for his part, seems more keen to profit personally from the gamification of markets than to protect investors through regulation.

Feeding the world – a growing challenge

To keep our food secure, action must be taken to stabilize and protect the food supply chain

President Trump and Congress recently made several policy moves acknowledging the significance of phosphate and potash, which are necessary inputs for farmers to grow the food we all require. The Administration has designated potash as a mineral of strategic importance, while also exempting USMCA-compliant potash from incoming Canada and Mexico import tariffs and adding phosphate to the list of Annex II tariff-protected minerals. And a bipartisan, bicameral group of senators and representatives signed a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum supporting critical mineral designation for phosphate and potash, stating that “their significance for U.S. national security, food security, and American farmers is especially critical.”

Clearly the U.S. government understands the importance of these minerals. Now, it is time to move a step further and include potash and phosphate on the critical minerals list.

Why is this so critical? These minerals, found below the earth’s surface, provide nutrition to plants and soil as fertilizer. Innovative fertilizers help farmers grow more on existing farmland by playing an irreplaceable role in boosting crop yields and maintaining soil health—and accounting for more than half the food on our plates. Sustainably growing the food the world needs is simply not possible without them.

Because the global population is estimated to grow by almost 1 billion people—to more than 9 billion—by 2050, taking action on food security, already one of the world’s most pressing challenges, is even more imperative. Feeding this many more people will require greater crop yields, and the world can’t rely solely on new farmland to help close the gap. Arable land is finite. Bringing more farmland into production necessitates further deforestation and can have serious implications for biodiversity—which is not environmentally feasible in many parts of the world.

Yet still, there is an education gap making it challenging for people to understand the complexities and urgency at play. Most people are generations removed and miles away from experiencing firsthand how food is grown. Mistaking fertilizer’s purpose with that of other agricultural inputs, such as pesticides, also contributes to a lack of understanding.

Nonetheless, fertilizer will continue to play an essential role in closing the gap. However, just one disruption—whether geopolitical, economic or environmental—can echo across continents, threatening food security and creating chaos. Shocks to nutrient supply do not just pose a risk to crop yields—they put pressure on farmers, strain rural economies, and expose cracks in a nation’s agricultural infrastructure. A weakened domestic food system is a weakened nation.



Complexities and volatility in the food supply chain underscore the vulnerabilities of our interconnected food systems and the criticality of formal and permanent protections. Solving this conundrum requires policymakers to prioritize food security.

By designating phosphate and potash as critical minerals, the Administration would signal that agricultural inputs are at least as important to national interest as other minerals that have been placed under this protection. A critical mineral designation offers long-term protections, streamlines the permitting process for production of these fertilizers and reduces dependence on foreign sources. At the same time, tariff exemptions ensure American farmers have a reliable and affordable supply of essential inputs for their crops.

It falls to the public and private sectors alike to commit to using every tool at their disposal to stabilize food systems—championing collaboration and innovation. We must balance the imperative to boost crop yields with the obligation to preserve our land and water for future generations.

In a world increasingly shaped by extreme weather, geopolitical conflict, and rising populations, the ability to feed people consistently and sustainably is one of the most vital responsibilities any nation can uphold. Contributing to resilient food systems isn’t just for the benefit of one’s own country and people—it is essential for all. Aligning food security and national security, as with these recent safeguards to imported potash supplies, should be a U.S. priority.

Seoul, April 28th, 2025 — As smart city innovation takes center stage in the race for a sustainable future, the World Smart Sustainable Cities Organization (WeGO), one of the world’s longest-standing organizations dedicated to global cooperation among city governments on smart city initiatives while operating with public-private partnership (PPP). WeGO’s Secretariat is based in Seoul and has regional offices in Chengdu, Istanbul-Beyoglu, Abuja, Abu Dhabi, Cuenca, and Almaty. WeGO has opened applications for the 2025 Seoul Smart City Prize. Celebrating excellence in human-centric and technology-driven urban development, the Prize invites cities, corporations, institutions, and individuals worldwide to showcase initiatives that are shaping the cities of tomorrow. Winners will be honored at a prestigious ceremony at Seoul’s COEX Convention and Exhibition Center during Seoul Smart Life Week (SLW), highlighting the best smart city projects for smarter, more inclusive cities.

Marking its third year, the beauty of the Seoul Smart City Prize lies in its emphasis on capturing efforts despite differences in the smart city development stages, infrastructure, and resources each city is faced with. The criteria and indicators of the Seoul Smart City Prize are carefully selected to capture both the current trends in smart city development. Rather than awarding only the most advanced technologies, it recognizes innovative uses of existing solutions. The Prize places special emphasis on digital inclusion, human-centered digital transformations with tech-driven solutions that benefit vulnerable populations and promote equitable, sustainable growth.

President of WeGO and Mayor of Seoul, Oh Se-hoon, stated, “If cities around the world can work together to improve the quality of life for citizens through the Seoul Smart City Prize, I am confident that we will be able to overcome difficult urban problems and achieve mutual growth.”

Among the Seoul Smart City Prize categories, Tech-InnovaCity, Human-CentriCity, Leadership, and Special Mention, the top winners of 2024 were the cities of Abu Dhabi, Addis Ababa, Arlington, Baguio, Cali, and Reykjavik. Over 200 submissions were collected across 58 countries and 123 cities with regional distribution made globally throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East, North America and Oceania.

Baguio, Philippines earned the Human-CentriCity Gold Prize for its commitment to digital inclusion, particularly through its Leadership, Empowerment, and Advocacy for Inclusive and Accessible Health Governance System. The city’s healthcare system faces issues like fragmented records, inefficiencies, and care gaps, leading to higher costs and delays. The BIAG project addresses this by providing accessible health records, telemedicine, and equitable healthcare access. It connects hospitals for seamless care with comprehensive medical records from birth to death ensuring efficient, inclusive, and high-quality care for all.

Reykjavik, Iceland, secured the Tech-InnovaCity Gold Prize, recognized for its Better City For Children – School Services project, which empowers local communities to play a vital role in schooling services development efforts. Reykjavik revamped its school services by creating a digital system, streamlining applications, and improving communication. Key changes included secure info-sharing between teachers and specialists, forming solution teams for early intervention, and replacing paper forms with a single digital application. These efforts boosted the efficiency of school services.

In the Leadership Prize category, Adanech Abiebie, Mayor of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia was honored for his significant contributions to Addis Ababa’s development and residents’ well-being, positioning the city as an international leader in smart urbanism. The Corporation Prize under the Human-CentriCity category went to a new member of WeGO, LG Electronics, alongside the City of Tampere and Nokia Arena for their collaboration.

Special Mention was also awarded in collaboration with key partners of WeGO, such as the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), International Institute for Management Development (IMD) and SEMI. GGGI’s Special Mention went to Iligan, IMD awarded Istanbul while SEMI awarded Dassault Systèmes with for their outstanding contributions to sustainable urban growth and citizen-centric digitalization efforts.

Shared burdens make stronger allies and more stable regions

Europe’s new defense investments show Trump-era pressure is producing a long-overdue rebalancing of NATO responsibilities

By John Vick, Executive Director at Concerned Veterans for America

2025 has been a rough year for the elite foreign policy literati throughout the Western world.

From Washington and New York to Paris and Brussels, there is a ripping of tunics and gnashing of teeth which escapes living memory. Dark clouds have formed over the Kennedy School of Government – a sign that the gods of liberal internationalism are displeased. One shudders to imagine the sacrifices to come.

The reason for this calamity, according to some very important people wearing blue suits and brown shoes – people with thick business cards and key fobs that grant access to highly esteemed office buildings – is that the United States is abandoning its allies all over the world.

In a frenzy of retrenchment, the great guarantor of global peace and security is sallying home to bask in supposed isolationism; the United States under President Donald Trump is abandoning NATO, Kyiv, and the international order that it created, come what may.

This hysterical rhetoric flies in the face of both empirical evidence and President Trump’s stated intent. The United States has very capable European allies – they simply need a little extra encouragement on actualizing those capabilities.

President Trump’s tough discourse with America’s friends across the pond has led, in very short order, to the most substantial progress in regional security burden sharing that any living American can recall: an €800 billion investment by Europe in its own security.

Originally known as “ReArm Europe,” the European Commission recently rebranded the effort to “Readiness 2030” – a reference to the date by which Russia might have the capability to launch an attack on a NATO or EU member state.

The EU is flexing its fiscal policy to generate the funds: €150 billion in low-interest loans will help countries “invest in key defence areas like missile defence, drones and cyber security” while member states are empowered to devote an additional €650 worth of EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to defense spending without triggering EU fiscal penalties.

In other words, a regional alliance of generally prosperous and well-developed nations identified a security threat, worked out a plan to mitigate that threat, and got the money together to fund their plan.

Capable allies, being capable.

It is also worth noting that these capable allies make a lot of great gear. Some of the quietest submarines, the toughest tanks, and stealthiest jet fighter systems are designed, funded and built by American allies. The key is getting them to build enough of them to share the burden for protecting themselves and securing our common interests around the world.

Readiness 2030 is a highly encouraging response to America’s new tack on foreign policy, but such responsiveness to burden sharing has not always been the case.

In the 80 years since the end of the Second World War, the United States has shouldered a disproportionate share of responsibility for European security. In the nascent days of the Cold War, this made a lot of sense – two world wars had devastated European infrastructure and society, and the United States was the only country positioned to defend the continent against an expansionist Soviet Union.

That post-war relationship, anchored in NATO, skewed Europe’s security evolution in a way that we have only recently begun to address. It was only last year that a majority of NATO members finally started paying 2% or more of national GDP on defense spending, over a decade after agreeing to these targets at the NATO Wales Summit. But after Russia’s 2022 re-invasion of Ukraine, Europeans need to be thinking bigger.



Despite Europe being much more exposed to trans-regional threats than the United States (which spent 3.4% of GDP on defense in 2024), underinvestment has been the norm outside of Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Belgium, a founding member of NATO, spent only 1.4% in 2024. The tiny nation of Luxembourg, another NATO founder and perhaps most indebted to the NATO alliance, spent only 1.3% in 2024 – even while having the highest GDP per capita in the world (estimated at over $140,000 per person in 2025). Even some of Western Europe’s most militarily powerful nations, Germany and France, only reached the 2% threshold last year. Germany’s Bundeswehr, which at one time fielded 12 divisions on the frontline of the Cold War, is a shadow of its former self and has serious readiness problems.

This is in stark contrast to how America’s most capable allies and partners invest in their own security: Israel at 5.3%, the Republic of Korea at 2.8%, even Poland at 4.1%.

Military expenditure (% of GDP, 2013-2023) – Korea, Rep., Poland, United States, Israel, Kuwait, Euro area

Simply put, Europe has gotten a free ride on its own security because America offered one. It is hard to fault them for accepting American largess, but the time has come for all of us to be more responsible.

Shortly after his second inauguration, President Trump struck a distinctly different tone with regard to regional security in Europe and around the world.

Regardless of how some may judge his tone and tenor, the message is clear: American alliances must be anchored in mutual benefit and directly related to U.S. national interests. No more free rides.

It is a credit to both President Trump and our European allies that this message seems to have been received and responded to in a constructive (if slightly begrudging) way.

Europe sharing the burden for its security protects Europe but also better protects American interests in Europe. It also empowers the United States to be nimbler in its ability to defend its interests in other regions – such as the Pacific.

It is incumbent upon American leaders to capitalize on this success, show that it works, and continue to lead among its allies. That will make America, Europe and the world a much safer place.

Realism and restraint produce better foreign policy

It’s time to rethink U.S. support for Ukraine and demand Europe shoulder its own security burden.

Since the outbreak of Russia’s war in Ukraine, the United States has remained heavily involved on the periphery, providing funds, humanitarian aid, weapons, and rhetorical support for the cause of Ukrainian sovereignty. Three years, 35 billion dollars, and over a million casualties later, it is time to rethink America’s role in the Ukrainian cause.

The U.S.’ role in Ukraine goes deeper than the peripheral, as reported in a recent New York Times story. A misguided and reckless foreign policy has allowed U.S. leadership under the Biden administration to inch us closer and closer to war with a nuclear adversary.

“America was woven into the war far more intimately and broadly than previously understood. At critical moments, the partnership was the backbone of Ukrainian military operations that, by U.S. counts, have killed or wounded more than 700,000 Russian soldiers. (Ukraine has put its casualty toll at 435,000.) …A vast American intelligence-collection effort both guided big-picture battle strategy and funneled precise targeting information down to Ukrainian soldiers in the field.”

That excerpt alone should give you pause. Not only has the U.S. taken the public role of supplying Ukraine with weapons and financial aid, but it’s also taken the secret role of contributing to specific military operations against Russia, including those that have targeted senior Russian military officials.

In doing so, U.S. leaders, and the foreign policy elites advising them, have put us dangerously close to retaliatory Russian aggression.

As much as we may wish for a Ukrainian victory over our geopolitical rivals (I’m a Cold War-era veteran, I get it), the world will rarely be exactly as we wish it. Operating as if we can shape the world in our image, bankrolling European security all the while, is foolish and dangerous. And notably, it rarely works.

The U.S. has carried Europe’s security bag long enough

Russia’s war in Ukraine has dragged on for more than three years now. While it’s heartening that negotiations to end the bloody conflict are finally underway, peace and stability seem a long way off.

One of the sticking points to these negotiations is possible Western security guarantees for Ukraine and what role the U.S. and NATO will have in the region’s future.

Naturally, Ukraine wants security guarantees as part of any negotiated settlement. Many European leaders feel the same way. That is hardly surprising, as most of Europe has allowed the U.S. to carry the bag for European security for decades – a continuation of the post-WW2 European security arrangement whereby the United States was the only nation equipped to secure the continent as it barreled into the Cold War.

At the end of the Cold War, European nations were cumulatively fielding dozens of divisions, numbering millions of troops, with America as the ultimate guarantor of European security. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, any pretense of security parity was abandoned – and the United States simply accepted it as part of a broader consensus that this was simply the cost of being the world’s only superpower.

Though NATO countries are inching toward meeting defense spending commitments and providing for their own security, Europe has developed a codependent relationship with the U.S. which assumes that Europe (and NATO) will always be America’s top priority. Only a substantial change in U.S. foreign policy will cause the Europeans to wake up and start treating their own security with at least the level of seriousness that the United States has for the past 80 years.

That policy change should come in the form of embracing realism and restraint.

The “pivot” that can’t take place

New U.S. leaders are well-positioned to now make decisions informed by how the world actually is rather than how we wish it could be. They must use America’s defense dollars and military might as the last resort within a spectrum of American foreign policy options, not a first step. Neglecting our non-military tools of national power causes us to overextend our resources, while strategic priorities go unaddressed.

For over a decade, policymakers have been talking about a “Pacific Pivot,” focusing U.S. strategic resources on countering China. Yet, for all that realignment, we continue to pour resources into the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The 2022 National Security Strategy declared that “(t)here is nothing beyond our capacity.” Respectfully, I disagree.



No nation, no matter how prosperous, no matter how rich in resources, can operate in multiple regions without a loss of effectiveness. Nor should it. Our simultaneous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were recent warnings about the danger of mission creep and confused goals as military leaders tried to prioritize too many things without a direct link to U.S. national interests.

The same is true today. Open-ended military aid to Ukraine has drastically reduced U.S. stockpiles of vital munitions. The limits of our inventories became clear after the October 7th attack by Hamas on Israel, which led to the U.S. rerouting artillery shells from Ukraine to Israel. Similar tradeoffs have become painfully apparent between our efforts to supply Ukraine and Taiwan.



Our potential adversaries are acutely aware that America is stretched dangerously thin, and they do all they can to exacerbate that situation by exploiting America’s foreign policy impulses. China can buy Iranian oil to indirectly support the Houthi rebels in Yemen that target U.S. ships. That means less American ships supporting Pacific operations.

But it’s not too late to stop taking the bait and correct our course.

Time to reprioritize

The Trump administration’s commitment to end the war in Ukraine is a good start, but it’s just that – a start. America must take a step back from overextending American lives and treasure in defense of other nation’s causes so that we can prioritize our own.

We must seek a swift end to the war in Ukraine that excludes any security guarantees from NATO or the United States. We must realign the security burden within NATO and refuse to continue funding the European security grift with American taxpayer dollars. And we must devote our resources to only the most strategic causes to be ready for the problems of tomorrow.

Trump is right: Zelensky does not have the cards

Ukraine needs a negotiated settlement

The recent, tense oval office meeting between President Trump, Vice President Vance, and Ukrainian President Zelensky, followed by a pause in U.S. aid and support have charted a new course for how the U.S. will participate in the war between Russia and Ukraine. In short, the administration (and President Zelensky too, per a letter sent to President Trump) are committed to peace and a negotiated settlement.

A realistic understanding of viable options for Ukraine is tough, but necessary.

The longer the war continues, the greater the chance the Ukrainian military will face a catastrophic collapse that will result in far greater Russian gains than might have been secured in a negotiated settlement. As President Trump accurately put it, Ukraine does not have the cards. And as former President Biden learned, those cards cannot be purchased with American tax dollars.

For years, the Biden administration’s rhetoric misled Ukraine into imagining that the United States could supply its war effort indefinitely and that Americans would be willing to guarantee Ukraine’s security with U.S. troops.

These misconceptions need to be dropped, and this war needs to come to an end.

After what amounted to a moratorium on diplomacy under the Biden administration, the Trump administration took the correct step of beginning talks with Russia about how to end the war. Such negotiations will be complex and difficult, but the Trump administration has thus far demonstrated smart instincts when it comes to recognizing the reality of the situation.

Ukraine is nearing the end of its rope. Its armies have fought bravely, but are depleted, demoralized, and exhausted. Ukraine is running out of weapons, munitions, and soldiers. The West is losing the ability to replenish the former two in adequate numbers due to the degraded state of our military manufacturing industrial base. As for manpower, Ukraine faces mass desertions, a failing campaign to draft its citizens, and reluctance to endanger its future by conscripting 18-22 year-olds. The war has already resulted in an estimated one million casualities.

These are unpleasant facts, but the world must face up to them.

Similarly, the world must accept Ukraine cannot join NATO. Any attempt to make such NATO membership an element of a peace deal will only prolong and worsen Ukraine’s suffering by increasing Russia’s incentive to keep fighting instead of seeking a ceasefire.

Russia bears clear responsibility for launching this war. That said, policymakers in the West are not without some blame. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have a history of rhetoric that encouraged more strident positions from Ukraine, even though they repeatedly proved unwilling to actually put NATO troops on the line. The 2008 Bucharest summit declaration that Ukraine and Georgia would one day become members of NATO was case in point. Prior to the Trump administration, Western policymakers felt that they had to lie to Ukraine about the possibility of an alliance even though they were never willing to extend NATO membership.

When war came, Ukraine’s Western partners encouraged Ukraine to ignore early opportunities for negotiations and cheered on a hasty, ill-prepared counteroffensive, squandering earlier chances for Kyiv to negotiate when greater capacity to resist remained.

Now Ukraine lies in ruins and Russia continues to grind forward taking more Ukrainian territory.

America’s key interest in the Ukraine war is preventing the conflict from spiraling into a regional confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. Rather than improving U.S. security, NATO membership for Ukraine makes nuclear war a far greater possibility and would permanently tie down hundreds of thousands of alliance troops in Ukraine at a time when the U.S. needs to be pivoting to greater priorities like Asia.

Even with the Trump administration’s notable progress in shifting more of the burden for European security to European countries, the U.S. will remain the primary guarantor of any check that NATO writes – and Ukrainian membership in NATO is a big, dangerous, blank check for the entire region.

The stark reality is, regardless of the moral and material support that the U.S. may want to give Ukraine, doing so on an open-ended basis is depleting our arsenals in ways that make war more likely elsewhere. While its latent economic strength dwarfs Russia’s, NATO’s economies are not mobilized for wartime production and are being substantially outproduced by Russia in key munitions like artillery shells.

Acknowledging that time is not on Ukraine’s side is an overdue reality check that policymakers have ignored for years, prolonging Ukrainian suffering and hurting U.S. interests in the process. Chief among those interests is a stable and predictable European security arrangement, and that has rarely come without difficult and realistic negotiation – just ask Dwight D. Eisenhower.

The Trump administration is right to pursue ceasefire negotiations to bring the conflict to a swift, needed end. The White House should continue its candor about U.S. interests and reiterate Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s remarks in February that the United States is not willing to provide security guarantees or support NATO membership for Ukraine as part of a peace settlement. Well-armed Ukrainian neutrality and a Europe willing to finally prioritize its own security are the best chances for Kyiv’s long-term independence.

Ukraine has no perfect options right now, but it is well-positioned to secure its sovereignty, rebuild its civil society, and secure a defensible peace. U.S. policy under President Biden did Ukraine a disservice by encouraging it to prolong a bloody, attritional conflict which risks its future when the most likely outcome has always been a negotiated settlement.

The U.S. must encourage Kyiv to seek the best remaining option for Ukraine’s long-term future, and make clear that a ceasefire based in neutrality, not NATO membership, is what it will support.

Family run tech firm sets the benchmark for tailor-made IT solutions and innovative products Leading software development firm OKsystem is blazing a trail through the public and private sectors courtesy of its outstanding advanced technology solutions

With the Czech Republic transforming its strong industrial base towards a knowledge-based economy, highly successful OKsystem is seeking to build on its work in the digitalization of state services by expanding its impressive international presence, as Chairman, Martin Procházka, explains.

Please tell us about your crucial role in the development of U.S.-based site www.vacaymyway.com.

The founders [of the vacation accommodation site] saw the opportunity to establish something new. They envisioned the system, but needed to find somebody who could develop it.

One of our former employees recommended OKsystem and our abilities and expertise to the founders. Initially, we only intended to create the code for the application that would be invented and designed completely in the U.S.

However, we moved from the position of coders to designers, analysts, and partners of the project. Over time, they understood we could add more value and we were entrusted with delivering the design and complete development of the system. It has been a great honor and we were offered the opportunity to become not just a supplier, but also a partner in the project.

We made a reasonable investment and continued the development in exchange for shares. I became a member of the board of VacayMyWay and am now responsible for overseeing the future development, influencing strategy and design of the system.



What about your global solution Checkbot which focuses on robots?

This project also began in an informal way. One of our employees was a friend of a technician at the Czech branch of Yaskawa, part of the global leading producer of industrial robots.

This technician recognized an opportunity for specialized software that could help clients. Together, we realized that this solution could be replicated across customers and that we needed to create a suitable software product.

We developed an application to monitor the work of robots online and perform real-time analysis of operations, tasks, signals, maintenance functions, production features and more.

Checkbot is now used in 15 countries and in 2024 alone we completed our first client installations in the U.S., Italy, Finland and France. The product is very relevant and trendy. It represents an exciting opportunity for us.

“The opportunities for investors are highly rewarding. The mastery of technology and IT expertise is high, but the cost of workers still competitive.” Martin Procházka, Chairman, OKsystem

Making business operations simple and easy to handle is a key aim. What makes OKsystem competitive in this regard?

As a partner of leading global technological companies, we embrace new technologies, development systems, databases, artificial intelligence (AI) and more. We are very flexible and follow the latest technological advances. Innovations are quickly integrated into our projects. This adaptable approach gives us a significant advantage.

We have been profitable for all but one of our 34 financial years and are frequently approached by global investors, but wish to continue as a Czech family business. We have more than 500 employees and an annual revenue of about $45 million. We provide a very wide range of products and services and are successful in several segments.



Investor appetite for tech companies is higher than ever, with AI at the top of that list for prospectors. What are the challenges for software firms in 2025?

The challenges concern how to use the new technology and how to employ AI, robotics and other trends into the existing and future solutions. However, the basic requirements remain the same.

The software should be user-friendly and not require complex training. When the software is used by a greater number of clients, it needs to maintain its response time, be flexible and its user interface updated smoothly. These are important features.



What is your policy for talent spotting, training and retaining staff?

The IT job market has become highly dynamic, making it challenging to attract and retain specialists. Despite the talent shortage, we are successful in this area. We care about our employees, have a great benefits system and maintain a good company culture.



Should U.S. investors focus more on the trade and investment opportunities taking place in your country?

The opportunities for investors are highly rewarding. The mastery of technology and IT expertise is high, but the cost of workers still competitive.

This is why many global companies are establishing their development centers in Prague and Brno, and also why enterprises like OKsystem compete with them for experts. It is a good prospect for investors and there are still plenty of opportunities to expand.



What is your main goal for the company for 2025?

To be as successful internationally as we are nationally. We have the ability to use our expertise and experience at an international level, building on our work with international projects such as vacaymyway.com and Checkbot.



What is your final message to the readers of Foreign Policy on why they should choose the Czech Republic for business and to invest?

Prague is one of the best and most beautiful cities in the world. It has a great history and a good environment, with very flexible and capable people. This is something that supports international business and is one of the many reasons to invest in the Czech Republic.



Innovating for the Future of Healthcare



How AI can help healthcare providers save time, simplify complex diagnostics and care for the planet

By: Philips

Faced with ongoing staff shortages, aging populations and increasing patient demand, healthcare organizations around the world are being compelled to rethink how and where they deliver care.

Innovations from the medtech sector, including artificial intelligence, can play a crucial role in improving health outcomes and reducing the cost of care, while simultaneously lowering the environmental impact, ultimately helping to give care providers more time to focus on what matters most: patient care.

Here are three trends for 2025 highlighting the potential of innovation and AI to deliver better care for more people.

1. How innovation and AI give back time

Healthcare leaders are turning to automation to reduce the burden on staff. The 2024 Philips Future Health Index report showed that 92% of surveyed healthcare leaders think automation is critical for addressing staff shortages by relieving them of repetitive tasks and processes. An equal percentage believe it will save healthcare professionals time by reducing administrative work, allowing them to spend more time with patients.

Generative AI has emerged as a powerful tool, promising to boost clinician productivity in ways that seemed impossible just a few years ago. It’s no wonder that 85% of healthcare leaders worldwide are already investing or plan to invest in generative AI within the next three years.

Already today, generative AI can function as a virtual assistant to save time for healthcare professionals, using large language models to organize clinical notes and simplify the ways patient information is communicated across teams. In areas like cancer care, generative AI could be a game-changer by summarizing vast historical reports to give care teams immediate insights into a patient’s history. It could also speed up reporting and translate complex medical information into common terms, helping to engage patients more in their own care.

2. How innovation and AI simplify complex diagnostics

AI can also elevate the skills of healthcare professionals. With experienced staff in short supply in many healthcare systems around the world, AI can help simplify complex diagnostics, enabling less experienced professionals to provide high-quality care with confidence.

For example, recent advances in AI have made cardiac CT easier to use, making it accessible to more facilities to increase capacity and deliver better cardiac care to more people. In addition, less experienced technicians can rely on remote consultations and expert training for virtual support and reassurance. Similarly, embedding AI in ultrasound systems allows physicians to detect, diagnose and monitor cardiac conditions more confidently and efficiently.

Integrating AI into cancer treatments can also enhance patient care by addressing the increased risk of heart disease associated with therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy. Studies show that adult survivors across a wide range of cancers face a 37% higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease [1]. The latest AI technologies can quickly detect signs of cardiotoxicity early in the treatment process by automating and accelerating echocardiographic measurements. Improved reproducibility and shorter study times make the process more efficient and reliable, reducing the risk of treatment delays. That’s good news for cancer patients who may otherwise face serious heart issues alongside their recovery.

3. How innovation and AI support sustainability

We’ve seen how AI holds immense potential to transform healthcare, increase efficiency and improve lives. And now, AI is also starting to help improve sustainability for organizations – including within healthcare technology.

Healthcare has a significant environmental footprint, accounting for 4.4% of global CO 2 emissions [2] – more than either the aviation or shipping industries. So there is the opportunity for AI to be used to help analyze supply chains and identify areas for improvement, reduce waste, and improve facility management. AI can also help increase imaging speed, translating into lower power consumption per patient scan. Operational efficiencies like these are just the start.

Yet digital solutions need considerable energy and materials to operate. Greenhouse gas emissions from information and communications technology (e.g. servers, computers, phones, and more) are expected to increase to 14% by 2040 [3]. With increased digitalization in healthcare, there is growing recognition that managing and minimizing the energy, material and water needs for AI will be essential to ensure the least impact on the environment.

Through the development and embedding of standards and guidelines for green software and AI, greater transparency of their environmental impact can be created, allowing healthcare providers to make more conscious choices when it comes to addressing the impacts of climate change.

A call for collaboration

As the demands on healthcare systems grow ever more complex, we need urgent and interdisciplinary collaboration from everyone – from engineers and developers to healthcare professionals and policymakers – to ensure a healthier future for all.

Technology alone is not enough. With half of the global population still lacking access to basic healthcare today [4], Philips continues to drive innovation that empowers caregivers, and improves workflows and outcomes, to deliver better care for more people.

Amid an era of remarkable technological advancements, the Emerald Isle is igniting big ideas, transforming industries, and shaping the future of global innovation. Ireland has established itself as a beacon of progress, positioning itself as a global leader in technology, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing.

Bolstered by an open economy, supportive government policies, and a skilled workforce, the country offers a vibrant environment for research, development, and entrepreneurial growth. The Irish government plays a crucial role in fostering innovation through policy and funding. Programs like Enterprise Ireland, the Industrial Development Authority (IDA), and Impact 2030, the national R&D strategy, provide financial support and resources to encourage startups, scale-ups, and established companies to invest in innovation.

“Investing in Ireland is investing in Europe,” says Oliver O’Connor, CEO of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), placing emphasis on the crucial role that the pro-business and pro-innovation government plays in bolstering growth in all industries.

Aligning research and industry

In recent years, Ireland’s innovation ecosystem has expanded significantly, attracting multinational companies, fostering local startups, and leading groundbreaking research projects that contribute to solving some of the world’s most pressing challenges. Companies such as Google, Facebook, and Novartis, have set up significant operations in Ireland, contributing to the country’s status as a European

tech hub.

These companies bring capital, knowledge, and employment opportunities, as well as

initiatives that drive local R&D activities. The clustering of these global giants, particularly in the “Silicon Docks” area of Dublin, has created a dynamic network effect, spurring the growth of tech-focused small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and innovative startups that thrive alongside these industry leaders. As part of the government’s forward-looking policies, the Impact 2030 strategy fosters strong connections between academia, enterprise, and public policy, driving progress in technology and digital transformation.

A global leader in medical innovation

As a powerhouse of research, innovation, and manufacturing, Ireland is recognized as one of the world’s top five MedTech hubs. More importantly, the country already hosts the largest global pharmaceutical firms, alongside a burgeoning group of local companies dedicated to cutting-edge healthcare solutions.

“It’s remarkable that 14 of the top 15 global biopharma companies have operations in Ireland,” remarks Caitriona Walsh, Country President of Novartis Ireland. This achievement is even more striking given Ireland’s population of just over five million people. Global pharmaceutical giants have long integrated Ireland into their international supply chains.

Swiss-based Novartis, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, has consistently invested in Ireland for the past seven decades. “Our global corporate center in Dublin’s Elm Park supports Novartis operations worldwide, and we employ around 1,000 people in Ireland,” notes Walsh, highlighting the company’s commitment to the Irish healthcare sector. The Dublin corporate center provides a range of services, positioned strategically between Novartis’ headquarters in Switzerland and its major US operations.

Ireland’s strong healthcare sector is supported by a network of leading research institutions and universities. Organizations such as Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the Irish MedTech Association offer funding and facilitate research partnerships, allowing companies to push the boundaries of healthcare. “Novartis collaborates with Irish universities and research institutes on advancements in areas like oncology, immunology, and gene therapy,” Walsh adds, citing partnerships with University College Dublin, University of Galway, and Trinity College Dublin.

Ireland’s emphasis on innovation and product development has been instrumental in the healthcare sector’s success. Research and development (R&D) fuels the healthcare industry, leading to advancements that improve patient care, enhance efficiency, and lower costs.

Novartis Ireland’s R&D efforts span diverse areas, from drug and medical device development to cutting-edge cancer therapies and advanced diagnostics. “Dublin’s unique ecosystem, combining a strong pharma and tech industry, enables us to attract top talent and drive innovation,” Walsh states.

The future of Ireland’s life sciences sector lies in digital health and artificial intelligence, with companies integrating these technologies to create smarter, more efficient medical solutions. The Novartis Global Service Center in Dublin serves as a “leading digital science hub,” says Walsh, adding that it generates economic impact through highly skilled employment.

“Ireland offers a highly educated workforce, and we find excellent talent locally. We also attract international talent, drawn by the opportunities here,” she emphasizes. Oliver O’Connor of IPHA agrees, noting that continued investment in education and skills is fundamental to Ireland’s global positioning as a healthcare innovation leader.

It’s time to close the gender equity gap in cancer care

Creating city-led solutions to transform health systems around the world, in cancer and beyond.

As we approach 30 years since the UN’s adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action for Women’s Rights – considered the most transformational global plan to advance gender equality worldwide – 189 countries have answered its call and collectively made significant strides towards closing the gender gap by increasing access to education, reducing violence against women, decreasing maternal mortality rates, and more. With this milestone just ahead, however, it remains all too clear that our work towards equality is far from over.

One area where we know this to be the case is in health. The global burden of cancer has shifted dramatically in recent decades, with this unrelenting disease now expected to become the world’s leading cause of death within the next 15 years. Currently, 70% of global cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), home to nearly two billion women. This demographic faces the highest disease and financial burdens from cancer of anyone else worldwide. Of the approximately 2.3 million women who prematurely lose their lives to cancer every year, as found in 2023’s Women, power, and cancer: A Lancet Commission report, more than one-third – an estimated 800,000 per year – could potentially be saved if given better access to optimal care. Changing the course of these statistics will take an incredible effort but allowing them to get worse is untenable.

At City Cancer Challenge (C/Can), we’ve recently undertaken a multi-year commitment, ‘Cities Taking Action for Gender Equity in Cancer Care,’ announced at the Clinton Global Initiative’s 2024 Annual Meeting, to address gender equity in cancer care in LMICs – beginning with three cities that have made gains in this area: León, Mexico; Nairobi, Kenya; and Tbilisi, Georgia, collectively home to 3.8 million women. The initiative, which is calling on additional stakeholders to join its ranks, ultimately aims to integrate a gender-responsive approach into cancer care across 15 cities in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, leveraging innovative, locally driven interventions.

This new commitment is an important step towards realizing our vision of transforming cancer care in resource-limited settings, with the specific aim of remedying the widening gender gap in LMICs. Gender equity in particular should be seen as a cornerstone of health progress in low- and middle-income countries, not only for its direct benefits to women’s health but also for its broader impact on families, communities, and economic development. To achieve equitable access, we need to put women’s physical, mental, and financial health at the center. The 2023 Lancet Commission rightly underscored the inequitable burden women around the world face in accessing cancer care; addressing the root causes of these gaps must start at the local level.

Through city-level partnerships, we work with local governments to understand gender gaps in cancer care, address them through tailored interventions, and generate data to scale best practices for impact. For example, in Tbilisi, nine projects conducted in partnership with City Hall and the Ministry of Health have already resulted in significant achievements: patients now receive medications directly at treatment centers, making treatment more accessible and shifting the focus to recovery; the cancer care workforce is benefitting from training aligned to international best practices, ensuring consistent high-quality care across the system; and the Breast Cancer Action Plan was developed to support implementation of the World Health Organization Global Breast Cancer Initiative in Tbilisi. Last year, these projects transitioned to the national scale-up and sustainability phase, now under the Ministry’s direct leadership, with the intention to strengthen cancer management across Georgia.

“These initiatives have fundamentally transformed how we deliver cancer care in Tbilisi, impacting not just the city, but the entire region and nation of Georgia,” said Nia Sharikadze, Head of the Medical Oncology Department at Mardaleishvili Medical Center in Tbilisi, Georgia. “By working with City Cancer Challenge, we’ve built systems that not only address current needs but create a sustainable foundation for equitable cancer care.”

By applying a gender lens, we can now help ensure that the health system adequately caters to the specific needs of women. Gathering disaggregated data, for example, will help us evaluate existing gender gaps, identify priority barriers to be addressed, and ultimately accelerate progress.

Implementing a city-level foundation of change forms building blocks that can be scaled toward global action, ensuring more equitable cancer outcomes globally. This local approach has been proven to drive transformative change and we now have an exciting opportunity to leapfrog this progress in improving women’s health. We are grateful to our enabling partners Amgen, Global Focus on Cancer (a US charitable organization supported by donations from Eli Lilly and Company), MSD, Roche and Siemens Healthineers for their dedication to this important work.

We believe our model can help change health systems across the world, in cancer and beyond, with the right collaborators, funders, and frontline leaders by our side. By focusing on cancer and demonstrating the impact of locally owned and implemented solutions, we can pave the way for sustainable systemic improvements and community-driven approaches on a broader scale—improving access and outcomes for all people.

Supporting Food Security through Emerging Technologies

Leveraging technology and local expertise for comprehensive food security solutions.

FEWS NET, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, was established in 1985 by USAID in response to devastating famines in East and West Africa to address the critical need for better and earlier warning of potential food security crises. It is often lauded as one of the most successful programs in the agency’s history. FEWS NET provides timely, evidence-based, transparent information and analysis of current and future acute food insecurity all over the world – from Central America to East Africa to Ukraine, and everywhere in between. This, in turn, informs decisions on humanitarian planning and response in the world’s most food-insecure countries.

Chemonics International’s Stephen Browne leads the FEWS NET 7 Pillar 3 Task Order 1, which is focused on livelihoods and food security research. His team’s mission is to expand knowledge on food insecurity by developing Household Economy Analysis baseline profiles, livelihood zone maps, and analysis tools in targeted geographies. They seek to strengthen local capacity, support evidence-based food security efforts, and collaborate with FEWS NET’s Early Warning Team, USAID, and other partners to improve resource targeting and allocation.

As evolving market and trade dynamics, geopolitics, climate, and conflict make tracking and analyzing food insecurity ever more complex, Stephen reflects on the importance of innovation, local expertise, and strong partnerships in achieving FEWS NET’s mission.

At a time where new technologies are plentiful, how does FEWS NET balance their integration with human expertise?

FEWS NET’s Livelihoods Team welcomes innovation and actively explores methods to integrate technology and traditional data collection processes to address information gaps.

Technology can prove particularly valuable in contexts of conflict and inaccessibility, where traditional data collection may be difficult or impossible. For example, in Northeast Nigeria, our data collection teams could not access areas around Lake Chad due to ongoing conflict. Alongside consortium partners, the Livelihoods Team piloted an approach that used mobile phone data collection technology to interview the area’s residents. Integrating this technology is promising, but further refinement is required to explore the full potential of its application.

Many of the results of new data collection approaches – artificial intelligence, mobile data collection, and other computer-assisted technologies – are quantitative. However, traditional data collection methods can capture the story and context behind the numbers. For example, if households report not meeting our baseline of 2,100 kilocalories per person per day, it indicates a potential issue – either in how we articulated the line of questioning or in the respondents’ recollections. Manual, human-driven data collection allows us to remain flexible and adjust our questions during the interview to ensure accurate reporting on energy needs and incomes or expenditures. However, AI can review our database of global baselines and identify patterns in the datasets of geography, agroecology, market basins, and livelihood patterns, enabling us to form assumptions about un-reported areas and develop proxy baselines. AI-supported proxy baselines could further support the flexibility of this process and contextualize our analysis. Both approaches – technological and human-driven, manual ones – should complement each other to create the most complete set of evidence possible to inform food insecurity analyses.

What does this balance and integration look like in areas where implementation may be more challenging?

At the country-level, we start broad, collecting data through various methods, including livelihood zoning and mapping exercises. Then, we move to smaller, more targeted sampling within each livelihood zone.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), for example, teams collected qualitative data on seasonality, production, market prices, and socio-economic profiles through focus group discussions, corroborating information gathered across multiple regional-level livelihood zoning exercises. This information is still collected via paper and pencil at the territory, market trader, and community leader levels, while a tablet is utilized for household representative interviews.



On the other hand, implementing partner REACH identified an opportunity to streamline some of our data collection approaches, particularly in conflict-affected areas, to minimize the time data collectors stay in insecure environments. By adopting digital versions of our traditional paper and pencil tools alongside the tablets used for our quantitative household level representative interviews, teams could more quickly and safely collect, store, and share this data.

What role does local expertise play in addressing food security?

Our project has had great success tapping into the expertise of local government stakeholders. We recognize the real value in strengthening existing technical capacity and collaboratively reinforcing the current food security analysis infrastructure.

In Mali and the DRC, we included government stakeholders in planning and executing the fieldwork and analysis, ensuring transparency and open communication. Their insights on the operating environments were crucial and greatly enhanced our planning, reduced inefficiencies, and provided first-hand context to the analysis results.

We also worked alongside government institutions, UN agencies, and NGOs in the DRC to understand how newly developed baselines can inform existing food security monitoring structures. Now, these groups are positioned to independently conduct food security analyses nationwide alongside FEWS NET’s early warning team and food security analysts from multiple agencies, which reduces the need for external consultants or international experts.

In your experience, how can the public and private sectors collaborate to lead innovation in food security?

Private sector partnerships have untapped potential to complement public sector work, especially around data collection and disaggregation.

Many of the world’s rural poor do not produce sufficient food from their land, and therefore must work for others to earn the cash used to purchase food and other items for survival and to maintain their livelihood. In Guatemala, for example, private companies in the coffee, sugar, and fruit sectors monitor wages, seasonal peak periods, frequency of work, and other labor-related information. FEWS NET could use the data to communicate needs to decision-makers, allowing them to more accurately target their support to populations most in need of assistance.

Collaboration with the private sector to develop and implement innovative solutions around data collection, local infrastructure, market access, and capacity strengthening can enhance current methods and fill gaps that will add value to food security analysis. FEWS NET looks forward to future partnerships with organizations in both the public and private sectors to better serve decision-makers and the communities where we work.

Redefining Public Health in the Age of Climate Crisis

The climate crisis leaves us with little choice: we need to radically rethink health and healthcare

Image credit: Bilanol

By Patty O’Hayer, Global Head of External Affairs, Reckitt

Hurricane Milton, which swept through Florida last week, is the latest flashpoint in a broader crisis — the escalating effect of climate change on human health.

It’s a crisis that will get worse before it gets better. Between 2030 and 2050, the climate emergency is set to cause 250,000 additional deaths per year. Covid exposed the frailties and inequities of our global health system, and climate change is now doing the same, on an even grander scale.

This problem also runs in the other direction. The health sector itself causes five percent of global emissions and if the industry were a country, it would be the fifth largest polluter on earth. Close inspection of climate change and health therefore reveals a double-sided malady: climate change harms human health, while human health systems harm the climate.

To drive lasting change in the face of these twin challenges, we need a radical rethink of health and healthcare. Global health and health systems are sick. To find a cure, we need to transition away from a top-down, treatment-based model, to a more holistic approach, which places much greater emphasis on keeping people well.

Such a shift may sound like a tall order. Especially since less than 7% of health spending goes toward prevention. But it is already happening. In cities and communities in almost every country, we are seeing the value of projects that strive to tackle the social and environmental determinants of ill health at source.

Health isn’t and cannot simply be the responsibility of doctors and nurses. It’s also the remit of urban planners, mayors, employers. Even teachers. We shouldn’t just be fighting childhood asthma by prescribing more and more inhalers, but also by designing cities in such a way that children don’t breathe in toxic fumes on the way to school, or live in damp, poorly ventilated housing.

A pioneer of this approach is Dr Ashwin Vasan, until very recently Health Commissioner of New York City. His public health initiatives encompassed housing, mental health and urban planning. He promoted health equity through local outreach efforts and made a point of asking the poorest communities, who regularly fall through the cracks of government health provision, how best to serve their needs. Integral to his approach was education: he didn’t just give out food to the needy. He taught young people in New York City to prepare fresh, inexpensive meals.

Local, place-based approaches have a critical role to play in supporting healthier, happier lives. Cities are at the forefront of this movement, and with good reason. Urban centres, thanks to their population density, heat retention and energy needs, are much more vulnerable to climate change — including the catastrophic health impacts. Respiratory, water-borne and heat related illnesses will hit first and hardest in the metropolises that now house 55 per cent of the world’s population.

Fortunately, there is good work happening around the world, as highlighted by a recent Rockefeller Foundation report on urban climate health. The report, which suggests a new approach to global health in cities, is full of eye-catching examples of “climate-informed” ground-level health action. There’s the municipal initiative in Rio de Janeiro uniting entomologists, meteorologists and urban planners behind a plan to curb dengue outbreaks. A project in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where a multi-sectoral team is giving umbrellas and drinking water to people during heat waves. And Lusaka, Zambia, where a Collective Service group was formed to better understand the social, cultural and behavioural drivers of cholera transmission.

There is no glory in prevention. It is long-term and unsexy. But it is imperative if we are to stem growing threats to health, the intensifying pressure on health systems and the emissions caused by the health industry. Much more must be done to help build the business case for holistic, preventative healthcare.

This kind of healthcare only works when people are empowered to take responsibility for their own health. Today’s national health systems are under-resourced and over-burdened. Community-schemes, health education campaigns and local support groups must fill the gaps. Health must begin at home. Healthcare, to some extent, needs to become self-care. That is what prevention-based healthcare means in practice. And it won’t only lead to longer, happier lives. It’s also the only way to rapidly decarbonise our healthcare industry.

As Hurricane Milton melted into the atmosphere, government agencies stepped in to help pick up the pieces. But the long term battle for health amid a climate emergency will be waged by the local community. Tampa mayor, Jane Castor, understands this well. Last year, her city government published a report on how to maintain Tampa’s prosperity in the face of escalating health and climate threats. “It is up to us to roll up our sleeves and continue working together to make this document a reality,” she said in the foreword, “The hard work starts now.”

Guatemala: Striding from crisis to a brighter future Having undergone an historic institutional crisis, Guatemala’s new administration is plotting a path to boost inward investment and usher in a new era of stability to drive forward the region’s largest economy Photo by: Marcel Houdelot

After coming through the deepest institutional crisis of its history, Guatemala is preparing a strategy in order to start living up to its promise as Central America’s largest economy by reasserting its democratic principles and encouraging investment flows to unlock its full potential.

Despite boasting macroeconomic stability, a strategic location, and a plethora of investment opportunities, the country has historically grappled with a lack of foreign direct investment (FDI). However, recent developments signal a shift in this narrative, with Guatemala readying itself to emerge as a beacon of economic opportunity in the region.

In January Bernardo Arévalo was sworn in as Guatemala’s president with the backing of the international community after overcoming concerted efforts to derail the transfer of power and prevent his inauguration. Now, Arévalo’s administration is focused on restoring prestige to the country’s institutions and using its legitimate power to bring improvements to the lives of Guatemala’s 18 million inhabitants.

Now, Arévalo’s administration is focused on restoring prestige to the country’s institutions and using its legitimate power to bring improvements to the lives of Guatemala’s 18 million inhabitants.

“We are implanting what I call the three R’s: rescuing our institutions from the asphyxiating embrace of corrupt appropriation; rebuilding those institutions so they can perform the function for which they were intended; and responding to the needs of the population,” said Arévalo.

“If the fight against corruption is the most urgent task, the most important one is to provide solutions for the country’s development.”

And there are increasing signs that the economy is moving in the right direction. According to data released by Guatemala’s Central Bank, foreign direct investment (FDI) rose to $1.55 billion in 2023, marking an 8% increase from the previous year and the second-highest inflow since 2008. For 2024 the government has reaffirmed its commitment to create the necessary conditions to encourage more private investment from within and outside the country.

Invest Guatemala, the country’s private investment promotion agency, is generating tailored strategies to attract investments in key sectors, including apparel and textiles, light manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, biotech, electronic manufacturing services, BPO and IT outsourcing, as well as sustainable tourism. The goal is to grow annual FDI beyond the $2-billion mark in the short term.

In terms of economic performance, Guatemala’s trajectory is equally promising. Despite global headwinds, GDP grew by an encouraging 3.5% in 2023. Looking ahead, growth drivers for 2024 encompass a spectrum of sectors, including banking and financial services, real estate and mining, underpinning the nation’s diversified economic landscape.

Investors can count on Guatemala’s robust financial system, coupled with the lowest government debt in Central America at 27.2% of GDP. Prudent fiscal management is also evident in Guatemala’s fiscal deficit, which stood at a mere 1.3% of GDP in 2023. Other hallmarks of Guatemala’s financial system are low levels of non-performing loans, ample liquidity, and robust solvency.

Free trade agreements encompassing over 40 countries and including the DR-CAFTA accord with the US mean Guatemala provides a base with broad access to global markets, facilitating seamless trade and commerce. Guatemala also offers a suite of fiscal incentives and special regimes aimed at bolstering investment attractiveness, including income tax exemptions, VAT and tariff duty exemptions, and a foreign investment law guaranteeing equal treatment for both domestic and foreign investors.

President Arévalo believes the drive to provide legal stability will in turn encourage much-needed investment and enable his administration to boost Guatemala’s infrastructure and human capital, citing plans to roll out public-private partnerships (PPPs) for growth.

“We are convinced that the state needs to boost significantly the levels of public investment in infrastructure for our development,” he said.

Through initiatives like the Guatemala Moving Forward (Guatemala No Se Detiene) plan, which fosters collaboration between the private sector, government, and academia, Guatemala is charting a course towards enhanced competitiveness and a more favorable business climate. Improvements to Guatemala City’s airport, major and minor highways, and the country’s ports are seen as key developments in a more dynamic future economy.

In terms of energy, more than 70% of Guatemala’s electricity is generated from renewable sources, underscoring the nation’s commitment to sustainable development and environmental stewardship.

Arévalo’s presidency has received support from the US Administration, with Guatemala’s leader present at the White House for a bilateral meeting in March. Noting that the “will of the Guatemalan people, by our observation, has triumphed,” Vice President Kamala Harris announced an additional $170 million in US funding for development, economic, health, and security assistance in Guatemala.

Arévalo claimed “a new foundation had been laid” for US-Guatemala relations, part of the country’s strategy of becoming a bigger player on the international stage as a reliable partner for economic partnership and human development.

“What the international community can expect to find in Guatemala is a transparent and open partner for any collaborative strategy that leads to the improvement of the conditions for the development of both democratic institutions and the well-being of the people who live in our countries,” Arévalo concluded.

Skoll World Forum Shines Spotlight on Climate Change and Indigenous Rights Philanthropists and activists at the Skoll World Forum are talking about climate change, including how it intersects with the rights of indigenous people, and how to encourage more climate action for everyone. Joan Carling at Branca SWF2024 Skoll World Forum 2024

It’s a bitter irony of climate change that those who have contributed the least to it – like indigenous people in the mountains of the Philippines, or community entrepreneurs in the Brazilian Amazon – often suffer most from its effects. They are also largely shut out of global policy making discussions about how to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate its effects.

Their voices are being heard this week, though, at the Skoll World Forum, an annual gathering at the University of Oxford that brings together nearly 1,500 social entrepreneurs, philanthropists, policy makers and activists to tackle some of the world’s biggest problems. The specter of climate change looms large across the agenda of the forum, which began Tuesday and runs through Friday.

Whether in the Philippines, Canada, Brazil or elsewhere, indigenous people “have the smallest carbon footprints and have contributed the least to climate change,” said Joan Carling, executive director of Indigenous Peoples Rights International. “But they are on the front lines of climate impact.”

Carling traveled from the Philippines to the forum this week to make sure those peoples’ voices are heard.

“Climate change decisions that are made at the global level have serious implications for people on the ground,” Carling said. “We need broad support and to have a broad partnership and collaboration with other actors, with donors, with other NGOs and indigenous organizations around the world.”

Many of the forum’s delegates come prepared with potential solutions. Barbara Brakarz, executive director of Conexsus, a Brazilian nonprofit that works with community enterprises built around sustainable agriculture and other ways to sustainably use the resources of the Amazon, says she is particularly excited about growing interest in bioeconomy, a term that encompasses sustainable agriculture as well as sustainable forestry and aquaculture.

“There’s a lot of talk of bioeconomy as a potential alternative to deforestation,” she said. “We’re here to connect with funders and to engage with different coalitions and organizations that are working around climate issues.”

Pip Wheaton, a fellow with Ashoka, a nonprofit that works with social entrepreneurs around the world to help them effect positive change, says working at the “super grassroots” level, whether fishing communities on the western coast of Africa or social activists in Birmingham, UK, enables the organization to “see things that maybe don’t get attention elsewhere.”

One recent project explored why, with all the talk about climate change, individuals haven’t taken more concrete action around climate change.

“We have more solutions to climate change than ever before; more people care about climate than ever before; and science has given us a better understanding of what’s at stake,” Wheaton said. “Yet we’re still not seeing people acting definitively, in the areas where they have influence,” such as at their workplace.

To that end, one goal of her participation in the Skoll World Forum will be finding ways to encourage people to “embed climate change into their decision making” in those areas, she said.

Carling, who is attending the forum for the second time, said she finds the gathering a useful way to engage peers from around the globe on indigenous peoples’ rights and the global problems that affect them, especially around climate change.

“We want to partner with all those who genuinely want to advance social equity, to protect the environment, to build solidarity,” she said. “And to make a better world for everyone.”

Far from ending the war in 24 hours as he repeatedly promised, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Ukraine policy has been a failure. It has now been more than 100 days, and not only has there been no peace agreement or lasting cease-fire, but Trump has become so frustrated by his inability to deliver a deal that he is now threatening to walk away from talks altogether. Meanwhile, both sides are suffering hundreds of casualties per week along the front lines, and Russia continues to rain down missiles and drones on Ukrainian cities, killing thousands of civilians.

The failure of Trump’s approach was predictable. His assumption was that he could bully Ukraine into giving Russia what it wanted by embracing Russia’s narrative about the war and threatening to cut off U.S. support to Kyiv. But that underestimated both what Russia wanted—Ukraine’s complete subjugation—and a proudly independent Ukraine’s willingness to accept it. Even worse, by failing to include any threat of consequences for Russia if it refused to compromise, Trump gave up much of his leverage without getting anything in return, essentially saying to Moscow, “If you don’t agree with my plan, I’ll walk away and give you everything you want”—not exactly the art of the deal. If a petulant Trump does now walk away from attempts to broker peace, the result will be the indefinite perpetuation of a brutal war; continued threats to Ukraine’s territory, sovereignty, and democracy; and a further blow to Trump’s dream of appearing to be a diplomatic dealmaker.

There is an alternative, however, that even Trump should be willing to pursue. It would consist of spelling out costs Moscow will incur if it continues down its current path. This would be an excellent project for Trump’s new national security advisor/secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who was once a strong supporter of Ukraine’s independence and right to self-defense. And now is the right moment, ahead of possible direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey later this week—talks that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pledged to attend in person. Trump himself seems to recognize that diplomacy has reached a critical juncture, proclaiming that this week’s meeting will “determine whether or not a deal is possible” and that if it is not, European leaders and the United States will “proceed accordingly.”

Can these Gulf countries become leaders in artificial intelligence technology thanks to the deals? Does Saudi Arabia’s megaproject strategy make sense? And is the U.S. fossil fuel industry under threat from Saudi Arabia?

The Trump administration has been especially active on Middle East policy this past week. It reestablished U.S. ties with Syria, continued nuclear talks with Iran, and negotiated the release of an American hostage from Gaza. President Donald Trump also gave a speech vowing that the United States would no longer intervene in the region’s domestic politics. But Trump was otherwise mostly focused on touting more than $1 trillion in new investment from the Persian Gulf countries that he visited this week—Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar.

Can these Gulf countries become leaders in artificial intelligence technology thanks to the deals? Does Saudi Arabia’s megaproject strategy make sense? And is the U.S. fossil fuel industry under threat from Saudi Arabia?

Those are just a few of the questions that came up in my recent conversation with FP economics columnist Adam Tooze on the podcast we co-host, Ones and Tooze. What follows is an excerpt, edited for length and clarity. For the full conversation, look for Ones and Tooze wherever you get your podcasts. And check out Adam’s Substack newsletter.

Cameron Abadi: Qatar has offered to donate a new airplane to the Trump administration to serve as Air Force One—and for potential use by Trump after he leaves office. What sort of transaction is at work here?

Adam Tooze: Yeah, just for the record, the whole business of Air Force One is symptomatic of the state of things right now. I mean, the existing planes, which are so much the emblem of the American presidency in the world, they’re 30 years old. They need replacing—they are well beyond their usual service life. Talks about replacing them have been ongoing for 10 years or more. Trump’s first presidency already occupied itself with the issue. So there’s a real issue here. I mean, it’s not the top national priority, perhaps, but if you’re the president, it’s embarrassing to be flying around in an aircraft of this vintage.

And Trump has been in talks, actually, with the Qatari royal family—the Al Thanis, who are only too eager to help out—for some time about eyeing up one of their various flying palaces. The aircraft in question here is about 12 or 13 years old. Apparently, it’s already gone out of service as a main vehicle for the Al Thanis, so it had been palmed off on Global Jet Isle of Man, I think, a holding company, but this is the aircraft which is up for grabs. It’s valued variously at somewhere between $100 million and $400 million.

But obviously, yes, it’s a blurring of the fundamental lines between household and state, which are fundamental to the emergence of modern politics even in monarchies, let alone in republics where we have a president who is elected and rotates, and the office of state is therefore fundamentally separated from the person. But even in a constitutional monarchy, you would expect a clearer division than is exhibited here. This goes hand in hand with a bunch of other extremely personalistic deals. The Trump family is not shy about meddling in business in the Gulf. The Kushner real estate empire has strong links to various types of Gulf investors. There’s a Trump-branded golf course opening in Qatar as we speak.

But anyone who actually knows anything about Air Force One and aircraft and flying command centers and stuff will tell you that this is no deal at all, because Air Force One has to be a hardened aircraft. It has to have incredibly sophisticated communications equipment. It basically would have to be disassembled and reassembled to confirm A, that it was airworthy and up to the standards that you would want and B, that it wasn’t littered with bugs, various types of listening devices.

And so it doesn’t save any money at all. And to bring this thing into operation as a repurposed American Air Force One command center would require at least as much time as the most optimistic timelines on the Air Force Ones that are under contract. So it’s another one of those Trump spectacles, I think, which serves the purpose of ostentatiously flaunting levels of corruption, but also dysfunction at the heart of American government.

CA: The Persian Gulf region is placing an emphasis on becoming a leader of AI technology by attracting foreign tech investment in the form of data centers. But wouldn’t the real critical technology, or the actual meaningful intellectual property, still remain controlled by foreign companies? In which case, are these countries just engaging in hype about the importance of AI?

AT: I mean, the hardware technology is clearly in the hands of people like Nvidia and maybe some Chinese competitors, and the big engines are being trained by the Deepseek and the ChatGPT engineers. To that extent, they’re just in the same position as Germany, or the U.K., or, you know, the vast majority of states around the world, none of whom have the capacity to do this.

So like, why are we second guessing their projects, rather than, you know, anyone’s ambitions really to compete in this space, other than the places where this stuff originates. And in fact, even in the United States or in China, ultimately, a lot of the power resides at the corporate level and not in government hands, because it’s there that the capacities and technology are being mobilized. Ultimately, it comes down to how much they can localize and what they localize for. And the degree to which they can localize will depend on how much money they have. It’ll depend on energy supplies, which have been a big subject of discussion in the AI area. And obviously, the Gulf has perfect conditions for both renewables and fossil fuel steady energy supply. So that’s something that’s very much in their favor.

And who might their partners be? Well, what we’re seeing is that the Americans have lifted any kind of restrictions on the chips they can buy, so they appear to have leverage. We know they have strong relations with the Israeli tech sector, and we know also that the Chinese are only too keen to collaborate with them in various ways. So there’s no doubt, I think, that they can pull down on this.

CA: Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, has had very ambitious plans for the Saudi economy, including the creation of a fantastical new city in the desert called Neom. And at the same time, it seems like the Saudi budget is already straining. Is the economic agenda being revealed to be fundamentally irrational?

AT: Yeah, I’ve been doing some scaling here to just kind of get a grip on how crazily ambitious this project is. Because we kind of have this general sense that the Arab oil states are immensely rich, which they clearly are, but what is the scale? If we start with Qatar—population roughly 3 million, rough estimate of GDP, $213 billion. So that’s an awful lot of GDP for a very small number of people. The United Arab Emirates—Abu Dhabi, Dubai—10 million people, $500 billion. Still a huge amount of GDP for a modest population. Saudi Arabia, population 33 million, GDP $1 trillion.

So Saudi Arabia is in a different league in terms of the overall size of its economy, but it’s also in a difficult league in term of the size of its population. This is a substantial medium-sized state, like on the kind of Poland kind of size, right? Much bigger than Portugal, not quite so big as Spain. But they’ve got some people to feed out of the $1 trillion that they’re generating.

And with this $1 trillion GDP, a $1.5 trillion investment project in a far off location that is, at this point, not at the center of the Saudi economy—which is all further down the coast around Mecca, Medina, Jeddah, and then inland around Riyadh, right—the Neom project, which is MBS’s baby, is very radical and just unlikely, I think, to take off on the scale that he desires.

And so, unsurprisingly, I think progress has been modest. They’ve been scaled down. They were looking for 1.5 million people living there by 2030. They’re now looking at more like 300,000. Reports are little a vague about how much progress has been made. This doesn’t look as though it’s going to rapidly establish itself as a megasite for economic activity in Saudi Arabia. As large as that economy is, it’s not going to be steered quite suddenly into this really remote corner, this new geography by a measure like this, even with the willpower and the political force of an MBS behind it.

CA: Is there some overlooked aspect of rivalry in the U.S.-Saudi relationship when it comes to oil production? It looks like Saudi Arabia is actually increasing oil production right now, which is lowering the price of oil consequently—and in some ways, that’s putting strain on the U.S. oil industry. Is that a concerted strategy of weakening the United States—and does Trump himself appreciate this aspect of the relationship with Saudi Arabia?

AT: Yeah, it really is a mess. Trump wants several different things, which don’t really go together. He wants what’s called energy dominance, which I think basically means for the Americans to be major exporters of oil and gas. He also likes to promise things to the oil industry in the United States. So he likes to promise that they’ll be profitable and, you know, all the nasty sustainability green regulation will be removed and they’ll be at the heart of whatever future America imagines for itself.

But he also wants low oil prices for U.S. consumers. And there’s an obvious contradiction here in the conflict between producers and consumers. You can’t really have it both ways. You can find a comfortable compromise between the two at which oil prices are OK for the industry and not too painful for consumers. But in principle, there’s a conflict here, added to which then there were all the external players in the oil market. The fact of the matter is the oil markets is too big for any one producer to easily control it. And the Saudis have been trying. They’ve been trying to get OPEC, OPEC+, including the Russians, to restrict production so as to hold prices at a comfortable level.

The Saudis can make money on the oil at virtually any reasonable price. They can make money on oil in very, very low prices. The problem for them is budgetary. In other words, they need the revenue flow to maintain their ample spending. It isn’t the profitability of the oil production, as such, that’s the issue. So they’ve been trying to produce restriction, and it hasn’t been working. And even within OPEC, they’ve had massive cheating, defection.

And so Saudi Arabia lost patience and has decided to punish the norm-breakers by just increasing production, or at least threatening to increase production, producing a fall in prices, hurting everyone and basically showing that Saudi can take this pain for longer than anyone else. The oil price has correspondingly fallen from around $80 to roughly $55 at its lowest point. It subsequently rebounded a bit, but we’re now in the $60 to $70 range. This is good for U.S. consumers, but bad for U.S. producers.

Trump kind of showed his hand by going out on Truth Social immediately and, you know, boasting that oil prices were at way lower levels than they were actually at, as though this was some success for him. It’s a mess, right? So there’s a kind of incoherence here, but you’d have to say it’s always been a mess right?

This isn’t a mess peculiar to the Trump administration. This is a balancing act that we saw compounded, you know, in the case of the Biden administration by the added hypocrisy of them also professing to be all about the green transition. But when push came to shove and oil prices rose, members of the Biden administration denounced the American fracking industry for effectively being un-American because they were sticking to profit guidelines and not increasing fracking production when oil prices rose, and at the same time touted themselves as the fathers and mothers of the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act and America’s green energy transition.

So this incoherence is endemic in American energy policy. It’s endemic to any society that is both a producer and a major consumer at the same time. It’s always going to be a problem.

‘Let the Process Begin!’

After speaking by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin for more than two hours on Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump failed to get the Russian leader to agree to an immediate cease-fire in his war against Ukraine.

Trump as well as Ukraine’s European allies have been pushing for both sides to commit to an immediate, unconditional pause in the fighting; however, while Kyiv has said it will do so if Moscow agrees, the Kremlin continues to stall. On Saturday, Trump expressed optimism that he could secure an agreement from his Monday calls with Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and European allies.

But the cease-fire he hoped for remains elusive. Instead, the U.S. president announced on social media after the call with Putin that “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War.”

In a Truth Social post on Monday afternoon, Trump said he believed the call “went very well” and that “the tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent.” Yet he seemed to suggest that Washington intends to take a step back and leave it to others, especially the two warring sides, to work out a cease-fire agreement. “The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,” Trump wrote, adding that the Vatican had offered to host talks. “Let the process begin!”

Putin, for his part, described Monday’s phone call as “frank and substantive,” according to Russian state media TASS. However, he made it clear that Moscow would not agree to a cease-fire without first receiving concessions. “Russia is ready and will continue to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a potential future peace treaty outlining a number of positions, such as, for instance, settlement principles, the timeframe for signing a potential peace agreement, and so on, including a potential cease-fire for a certain period in case relevant agreements are reached,” Putin told reporters after the call.

Whereas Ukraine wants a truce before peace talks are held, Russia refuses to come to the table unless certain conditions are met. Namely, these include barring Kyiv from joining NATO; limiting the size of Ukraine’s military; controlling five Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories, including Crimea; and preventing Western nations from assisting Kyiv’s war effort.

Zelensky spoke to Trump ahead of his phone call with the Russian leader and then again on a call with European leaders afterward. In a post on X later Monday, Zelensky wrote that he’d “reaffirmed to President Trump that Ukraine is ready for a full and unconditional ceasefire” and that if “the Russians are not ready to stop the killings, there must be stronger sanctions.” He said that he, Trump, and the European leaders had discussed possible next steps for talks, including “meetings between negotiators and an objective assessment of each side’s proposals.”

He added, “It is crucial for all of us that the United States does not distance itself from the talks and the pursuit of peace.”

Previous attempts at direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv have largely failed. Last week, Putin declined to attend an in-person meeting with Zelensky in Istanbul, forcing both sides to send lower-level delegations in their place. Aside from a prisoner exchange deal, no progress was made during Friday’s negotiations, and over the weekend, Russia exacerbated tensions by launching nearly 300 drones at Ukraine in one of its largest such strikes since the war began.

Trump had initially endorsed the Turkey-hosted talks, to the relief of Ukraine’s European allies, which have pushed the White House to demand an immediate, unconditional cease-fire. However, following Putin’s last-minute snub, Trump appeared to diminish the meeting’s importance, saying that nothing would be resolved until he spoke with Putin directly. On Saturday, Trump reiterated that point by announcing Monday’s phone call with Putin to discuss ending the bloodbath.

“We’re at a point where we’re hitting an impasse, and that’s why the president is talking to [Putin] on the phone,” U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance said on Monday. “I think honestly that President Putin, he doesn’t quite know how to get out of the war.”

What We’re Following

Rebooting post-Brexit ties. The United Kingdom and European Union inked a landmark trade and defense deal on Monday, marking a new era for the continent nearly nine years after the country voted to leave the bloc. The agreement is designed to boost bilateral cooperation and counter steep U.S. tariffs on European steel, aluminum, and auto parts.

“At a time of global instability and when our continent faces the greatest threat it has for generations, we in Europe stick together,” von der Leyen said on Monday, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling it a “reset” in U.K.-EU relations.

Britain said the deal will add around $12 billion to the U.K. economy, improve energy security, and place fewer restrictions on British food exporters and visitors. Travel will become easier for British citizens and their pets, as they will now be allowed to enter Europe via electronic gates. And Britain will be able to take part in a $167 billion EU program to rearm the continent.

However, Conservative opposition in Britain is mounting. Some lawmakers have denounced an aspect of the agreement that will allow European trawlers to fish in British waters for 12 years in exchange for reduced trade barriers and paperwork. This will be “the end of the fishing industry,” far-right Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage said.

Aid amid attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Monday that the country would lift its monthslong blockade on humanitarian aid entering Gaza, which began in March when Israel first resumed large-scale strikes on the territory. According to the prime minister’s office, a “basic amount of food” will be allowed to enter Gaza beginning in the “near future.”

Netanyahu’s decision appears to be in response to warnings by Israel’s allies, including the United States, that “images of mass starvation” coming out of Gaza would prevent foreign powers from providing Israel with military aid. Rights experts had previously warned Israel that failure to lift the blockade could result in famine. “We cannot reach a point of starvation, for practical and diplomatic reasons,” Netanyahu said.

At the same time, though, Israel’s cabinet approved plans on Monday to seize Gaza for an indefinite period of time as part of the country’s expanded military campaign to defeat Hamas; intensified Israeli airstrikes have killed hundreds of Palestinians in the past week. The new policy will order hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to evacuate in a move that is expected to worsen the territory’s already dire humanitarian crisis.

Weekend election results. Portugal began coalition-building talks on Monday after its general election on Sunday once again resulted in a minority government. Prime Minister Luís Montenegro’s center-right Democratic Alliance bloc secured 89 seats in the parliament, winning the largest share but falling far below the 116 seats needed for a simple majority. Instead, the far-right Chega party surprised voters with an unexpectedly strong showing. Chega won 58 seats in the parliament, the same number as Portugal’s Socialist Party; in 2019, Chega had just one seat.

Yet ultranationalist lawmakers did not dominate all of Europe’s elections this weekend. On Sunday, pro-EU Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan defeated hard-right candidate George Simion in the second round of Romania’s presidential election rerun. Although polls initially had Simion in the lead, Dan came out with 53.9 percent of the vote.

Meanwhile, liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski secured a narrow victory on Sunday in the first round of Poland’s presidential election. With 31.4 percent of the vote, Trzaskowski’s first-place finish signals new hope for Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who seeks to solidify government control away from President Andrzej Duda and his opposition Law and Justice party. A runoff between Trzaskowski and Duda’s conservative candidate, Karol Nawrocki—who won 29.5 percent of the vote—is set for June 1.

Odds and Ends

Cue “Wasted Love,” Austria’s submission to and the winner of Saturday’s 69th Eurovision Song Contest. The dramatic pop opera, sung by classically trained singer JJ, stunned viewers with its high vocals and driving beat. But the contest was not without controversy. Despite Eurovision’s stated goal being to celebrate European culture and unity, Israel’s participation garnered fierce criticism from world leaders due to its war in Gaza. Israel’s submission—“New Day Will Rise” by Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack—came in second place.

Far from ending the war in 24 hours as he repeatedly promised, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Ukraine policy has been a failure. It has now been more than 100 days, and not only has there been no peace agreement or lasting cease-fire, but Trump has become so frustrated by his inability to deliver a deal that he is now threatening to walk away from talks altogether.

But that underestimated both what Russia wanted—Ukraine’s complete subjugation—and a proudly independent Ukraine’s willingness to accept it. Even worse, by failing to include any threat of consequences for Russia if it refused to compromise, Trump gave up much of his leverage without getting anything in return, essentially saying to Moscow, “If you don’t agree with my plan, I’ll walk away and give you everything you want”—not exactly the art of the deal. If a petulant Trump does now walk away from attempts to broker peace, the result will be the indefinite perpetuation of a brutal war; continued threats to Ukraine’s territory, sovereignty, and democracy; and a further blow to Trump’s dream of appearing to be a diplomatic dealmaker.

There is an alternative, however, that even Trump should be willing to pursue. It would consist of spelling out costs Moscow will incur if it continues down its current path.

Just as in his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump made his first state visit abroad to Saudi Arabia. He also visited Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Why are the Gulf states growing in influence? What does it mean for the United States and the world?

Middle East expert F. Gregory Gause joined FP Live to examine the rising clout of the Gulf. FP’s Ravi Agrawal explored with him the implications for global business, energy, artificial intelligence, and regional flashpoints such as Gaza and Iran.

As Israel launches a new offensive in Gaza and impedes deliveries of aid, half a million Palestinians are facing starvation; Gaza is increasingly likely to face a famine. In Sudan, 12 million people have fled their homes and 150,000 have died in what the United Nations says is the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Why isn’t the world doing more, and what can still be done?

“God knows, it’s a bad world,” said Martin Griffiths on stepping down last year as the United Nations’ lead humanitarian official. But does he see a way to mitigate the consequences of war and strife? He joins FP Live to explore solutions for the humanitarian crises around the world.

As China grapples with slowing growth and rising youth unemployment amid its ongoing post-COVID economic recalibration, the urgency of unification with Taiwan appears to be fading among young elites. My research, conducted among Chinese university students in Beijing, suggests that young elites—typically assumed to be increasingly nationalistic “little pinks” for their apparent pro-party, or “red,” views—are in fact becoming more pragmatic, inward-looking, and skeptical of war and conflict. This is in contrast to the nationalistic views espoused by the working-class, middle-aged Chinese cab drivers I interviewed from Beijing and Xiamen.

At the China Development Forum on March 23, Chinese Premier Li Qiang laid out an ambitious road map for the nation’s economic recovery, emphasizing consumer spending, innovation, and foreign investment. The message was clear: China’s priority is economic stability, not geopolitical conflict. For many young Chinese elites, Li’s focus mirror their own shifting concerns.

As China grapples with slowing growth and rising youth unemployment amid its ongoing post-COVID economic recalibration, the urgency of unification with Taiwan appears to be fading among young elites. My research, conducted among Chinese university students in Beijing, suggests that young elites—typically assumed to be increasingly nationalistic “little pinks” for their apparent pro-party, or “red,” views—are in fact becoming more pragmatic, inward-looking, and skeptical of war and conflict. This is in contrast to the nationalistic views espoused by the working-class, middle-aged Chinese cab drivers I interviewed from Beijing and Xiamen.

New U.S. policies, however—such as U.S. President Donald Trump’s ever-shifting tariffs—may increase resentment toward the United States and paradoxically increase support for unification as a defensive response.

While the opinions of Tsinghua University students are not a bellwether for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s actions, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has demonstrated an interest in cultivating youth opinion, particularly given the party’s emphasis on “patriotic education” in the past decade of slowing economic growth.

And as potential future leaders of the CCP (Xi is an alumnus of Tsinghua), elite university students—and the factors affecting their attitudes—hold important implications for U.S. policy.

In the spring of 2023, when I set out to test the assumption that nationalism was driving Chinese youth support for unification, I expected students at Beijing’s elite Tsinghua and Peking universities to reflect the growing hawkishness—or willingness to use force against Taiwan—seen in state rhetoric.

Instead, my findings revealed a striking reality: Students rarely discussed Taiwan at all.

“Taiwan? The topic doesn’t feel important,” one student said. “It feels far away from me—both geographically and mentally.”

This mindset was reflected in the results of an anonymous survey shared with students, which received more than 140 responses. When asked to rank eight “domestic” issues facing China from most to least pressing, Taiwan was second to last, only above climate change.

The other issues listed were, in order of most to least pressing: post-COVID economic recovery, socioeconomic inequality, social stability, attracting foreign direct investment, combating corruption, and improving education.

The cab drivers I interviewed, on the other hand, spoke of Taiwan in terms of its national significance, often referencing historical grievances. “If we lose Taiwan, we lose face,” one Beijing driver said. Yet even among this demographic, economic concerns loomed large. Many drivers shared that they had seen their incomes halved during the zero-COVID years, and though they were more likely than students to express support for unification by force, it was not their top concern.

The difference in attitude between students and cab drivers—generally middle-aged male yellow cab drivers I found via ride-hailing apps—may also reflect a broader generational shift. Many students noted that they felt notably “less hawkish” about Taiwan than their parents.

Other recent research on Chinese youth opinion has reinforced this anti-conflict and apathetic sentiment toward Taiwan, contradicting the common view of Chinese youth as increasingly nationalist.

“Our parents have ancestral ties to Taiwan and remember a time when the mainland and Taiwan had more exchanges. We don’t,” one student said. Others cited China’s shift away from a planned economy, arguing that their generation was more economically pragmatic and less driven by ideological nationalism.

Despite the popularity of this view, some students admitted that they still felt like outliers among their peers for their dovish views.

Many students described a political environment on their campus or in online forums in which “politically incorrect” talk led to criticism. One student said: “Taiwan is rarely brought up and discussed among friends, so I actually don’t know how others feel. We are only seeing the online posts and public comments. It’s more politically correct to say you’re pro-force these days, so it’s less common for those who are wary of war to speak their minds.”

Li’s speech at the China Development Forum reflected the government’s recognition of growing domestic anxieties and the need to boost consumer spending and consumption. He stressed the need for sustainable domestic economic growth despite rising global instability, reinforcing a sentiment I heard repeatedly in my interviews: Economic hardship has made young Chinese more inward-focused.

“Zero-COVID policies felt like wartime policies. It made me realize I don’t want war,” one student said. Another explained that after experiencing financial struggles firsthand during the pandemic, political abstractions such as Taiwan seemed less important. “If you are living well, it’s easier to look at the big picture,” the student said.

One student described viewing unification as a “merger and acquisition for China,” explaining: “After you weigh the costs and benefits of unification, it’s clear it’s politics, not rationality, driving this—there is not much clear benefit to unifying.”

China’s youth unemployment rate has hovered at record highs, with nearly 17 percent of young urban Chinese (a statistic that excludes students) struggling to find jobs. Even recent graduates from elite universities are disillusioned, with many embracing a “lying flat” or “letting it rot” mentality—phrases used to describe passive resistance to societal pressures. In this environment, a hypothetical war over Taiwan feels unwise and irrelevant.

Social discord within China could also influence this view; several students referenced Tsinghua and Peking universities’ participation in China’s White Paper Protests in November 2022 as evidence that Chinese society was less stable and therefore not ready to successfully pursue unification.

These apathetic sentiments disappeared, however, when unification was viewed as a defensive action in response to U.S. aggression. In the hypothetical scenario of Taiwan declaring independence, for example, students were more than twice as likely to support forceful unification. This was because students perceived a Taiwanese declaration of independence as dependent on U.S. support.

“The United States is the biggest reason for cross-strait tensions, not Taiwan,” one student said. “If America weren’t involved, unification would happen peacefully over time.”

Many students viewed Taiwan as just another “card to be played” by the United States in its mission to suppress China’s rise—no different, as they saw it, from Hong Kong, Tibet, or tariffs.

The language of these student views echoed the more nationalistic sentiments of cab drivers. One Beijing driver detoured to drive past Yuanmingyuan Park while answering, gesturing toward the garden that had been destroyed by French and British forces in the 1800s. “We Chinese have been bullied by foreign powers for too long,” he said. “When another power like the United States is knocking at your front door, you have to knock back.”

As China’s government emphasizes economic recovery, it may align with the attitudes of young elites. But China’s economic challenges today are different from those in 2023—primarily, the threat of tariffs and export controls by Trump.

While Trump’s recent 90-day reduction on China tariffs has provided momentary relief, uncertainty looms over future negotiations. And, the administration still maintains significant tariffs on certain Chinese imports — including technology and manufacturing. These tariffs, combined with its sluggish post-COVID recovery, could further strain consumer confidence and youth unemployment.

If Chinese policymakers continue to prioritize economic growth and domestic stability, the likelihood of the government’s aggressive push for unification may decrease. Yet U.S. tariffs are also inspiring nationalism that could fuel greater support for state-driven action—including potential aggression toward Taiwan.

Young Chinese today may not view unification with Taiwan as a priority. As China’s government again shifts its focus toward economic recovery, it may find itself aligning with the attitudes of its younger generation. However, external pressures such as tariffs, export controls, and U.S.-China tensions could alter these dynamics.

If the Chinese public begins to view Trump’s tariffs on China as related to U.S. support for Taiwanese independence, the United States risks inadvertently consolidating public support for unification—including among the rational, war-wary young elites who would otherwise oppose it. This support would provide Chinese leadership with domestic cover to further squeeze the island’s sovereignty—or tempt Beijing into pursuing a rally-around-the-flag moment.

The U.S.-China economic relationship is likely to only become more volatile throughout the next four years. As tensions (and tariffs) rise, it will be tempting for U.S. officials to issue strong language regarding cross-strait conflict and support for Taiwan. But they must be careful to keep separate their rhetoric on trade from that on Taiwan to ensure they do not bring about the very conflict they dread.

In an era of heightened tensions, the question is no longer, “Do young Chinese care about Taiwan?” but rather: “What U.S. policy—such as Trump’s tariffs—could change their apathetic mindsets?”

Some of those deals are also benefiting one of his most trusted lieutenants, billionaire Elon Musk. Musk announced during an investment summit in Riyadh that Saudi Arabia had approved the use of Starlink—the satellite internet service run by his company SpaceX—for use in the country, and the visit came weeks after his electric carmaker, Tesla, opened its first Saudi dealerships. Another of Musk’s companies, Neuralink, which makes computer chips it hopes to implant in people’s brains, announced it would conduct its first clinical trial in the Middle East, in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s trip to the Persian Gulf last week was all about big wins and sweet deals that he could tout to his base back in the United States, and he came away with $2 trillion in financial commitments from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.

Another of Musk’s companies, Neuralink, which makes computer chips it hopes to implant in people’s brains, announced it would conduct its first clinical trial in the Middle East, in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi.

Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, is in need of new revenue streams. His support of Trump—both in the tens of millions of dollars he donated to Trump’s campaign and his leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cost-cutting initiative that has fired thousands of U.S. government employees—has led to an immense backlash against his companies. Tesla, whose stock makes up most of Musk’s $370 billion net worth, saw its sales slump by a record 13 percent in the first three months of this year, and its profits plunged by more than 70 percent. Much of that drop came from the company’s prime markets in Europe and even in the United States, where Tesla has not only faced protests but also violence against its vehicles and dealerships.

In some cases, however, Musk’s close association with Trump has helped his businesses internationally, with countries taking steps to approve Starlink for use within their borders to get in Trump’s good books (and, in some cases, according to a report from the Washington Post, being pushed to do so by the Trump administration).

But even Trump and Musk’s bonhomie appears to be ending not with a bang, but a whimper. Musk’s influence, omnipresent during the first two months of Trump’s second term in office, has significantly waned in recent weeks as his 130-day term as a “special government employee” comes to a close. An analysis by Politico found that mentions of Musk by Trump officials and Republican lawmakers have dramatically reduced in recent weeks, and Trump himself has not posted about Musk on social media in more than a month.

Musk himself is looking to dial back his presence in Washington, telling reporters earlier this month that he would now only come to the U.S. capital “every other week.” Appearing virtually at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, the billionaire also said he would “do a lot less” political spending in the future. Asked whether it was in response to the blowback he’s received for his political activity so far, Musk said: “Well, if I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I’ll do it. I don’t currently see a reason.”

Musk isn’t yet completely absent from Trumpworld—he was in the Oval Office on Wednesday during Trump’s testy meeting with Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of Musk’s native South Africa, and also visited Capitol Hill and the Pentagon that same day.

Even on the Gulf trip, however, his deals were somewhat overshadowed by the coterie of U.S. companies whose chief executives also joined Trump, including Nvidia, Uber, Amazon, and OpenAI. Nvidia appears particularly well-positioned to cash in on the Gulf, signing agreements with Saudi Arabia on AI cooperation and expected to benefit from Trump’s deals to supply advanced chips to Saudi and UAE companies.



For Musk, the plan thus far appears to be to get back to business. But with those businesses still hurting and facing more uncertainty from his relationship with Trump, the big question remains how he turns it around and how much more his personal wealth—already down more than $60 billion so far this year—suffers.



Generation Z, or Zoomers, are people born between 1997 and 2012. And they are coming of age at a historically turbulent time. This is a cohort whose formative experiences have included a global financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, several wars, and the ever-present doom of the climate crisis. What do they think about world affairs, from the rise of China to the challenge that AI might pose to their prospects?

Kyla Scanlon has been dubbed the “economic advisor for Gen Z.” The 28-year-old writer and commentator has legions of social media followers who turn to her for explanations of financial and global trends as she coins terms such as “vibecession.” Scanlon will join FP’s Ravi Agrawal for a wide-ranging discussion on world affairs and feedback loops between public commentary and policymaking.

According to Dean Vuletic, a leading historian of Eurovision, three critiques from those early years persist to this day: It costs too much, the music is of mediocre quality, and the voting is “rigged.”

In the 1960s, just as the world’s most beloved song contest was entering its second decade, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) wagered the unthinkable: Should Eurovision be discontinued? At the time, the project of European integration was still new, the memory of World War II still fresh; Europop was just beginning to flood the car radios of the first-ever generation of middle-class Europeans to discover that “holiday” could be a verb. The contest, meanwhile, was mired in criticism.

According to Dean Vuletic, a leading historian of Eurovision, three critiques from those early years persist to this day: It costs too much, the music is of mediocre quality, and the voting is “rigged.”

This year was an odd time, as an American, to be attending this distinctly European phenomenon. Arriving in Basel, Switzerland, last week for the 69th edition of what is now the world’s largest musical event, whose more than 160 million annual viewers make it one of the most popular broadcasts in all of global television, it occurred to me that these are the very same complaints currently levied against liberal democracy: strained budgets, declining quality of services, and contested elections. As the trans-Atlantic relationship sinks to its lowest point since the Iraq War, the Eurovision slogan, “United by Music,” also feels newly urgent for continental security. The Trump administration could not be clearer: America’s own commitment to liberal tolerance is over, and Europe is on its own.

You might say Eurovision is, in fact, a rare example of what that future might look like: a model of the West without America. For despite the influence of American music on artists and the general rise of global Anglophone hegemony, the contest remains, Vuletic said, “quintessentially European” and the very largest cultural event “bringing Europeans together.” Is its ethos—that is to say, spandex, sequins, and the inalienable right to let your freak flag fly—the force holding together the last bastion of the contemporary Western order?

Winding through a Basel streetscape crammed with flags, balloons, and karaoke stages, where fans of varying vocal ability resurrected previous years’ hits, I wondered: Is this annual celebration of diversity and self-expression not, in some way, what liberalism is?

For the uninitiated—which is to say, for most Americans—there are many ways to describe Eurovision, but they all lead to the same conclusion: that the contest is characterized by paradox above all. Launched in Switzerland in 1956 to promote cooperation in postwar Europe, today Eurovision is the height of camp, bemoaned by music snobs and celebrated by members of the LGBTQ+ community, who have claimed it as the World Cup for queer people. It serves, simultaneously, as a show of transnational cooperation, a platform for nation-branding, and a “nonpolitical” arena for the celebration of liberal values such as tolerance, diversity, and individual expression—values that, as the recent rise of right-wing movements has shown, turn out be political after all.

It is an opportunity for countries from the former Soviet bloc or even from beyond the European continent—Australia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Israel are all veteran participants—to express their alignment with those values and the eurozone writ large. Or to reject them, as was the case when Turkey and Hungary withdrew their national delegations before the 2013 and 2020 contests, respectively, with the former citing sham voting and the latter implicitly rejecting the broadcast’s celebration of queer identity.

There are three rounds of live performances: two semifinals, followed by a final. Only 26 acts qualify for the finale bonanza, when the Eurovision victor is chosen live on prime-time television through a famously baroque rank-choice voting system that combines country-level public televotes with the results from each nation’s expert jury. (Americans can vote in the catchall category for nonparticipating countries, “Rest of the World.”) Juries and the public can award points to any nation except their own. The resulting voting patterns have spawned an entire academic subfield analyzing world-historical alliances and rivalries steeped in 20th-century history: This year, as every year, the people of Cyprus awarded the maximum 24 points (12 from the public, plus another 12 from the jury) to Greece. Translated into Yankee argot, you might say Eurovision is a cross between the Super Bowl halftime show and the Olympics, viewed through the haze of a strong 20th-century hangover.

The winning country hosts next year’s competition, unless they can’t afford to or are at war, as was the case for defending champion Ukraine in 2023, which passed the honors (and expenses) to Liverpool in the United Kingdom. In the end, even as Eurovision is officially a nonpolitical event, everyone knows it’s really geopolitics in drag.

The United States has never participated in Eurovision, not because it isn’t geographically located in Europe (otherwise countries such as Israel and Georgia wouldn’t be in the running) but because, unlike the 37 countries that took part this year, none of its public broadcasters are members of the EBU, the host organization for Eurovision. It’s the EBU that maintains rules and regulations regarding eligibility, as well as the contest’s nonpolitical nature.

That said, there is a certain protectiveness of Eurovision’s European quality vis-à-vis the United States. (As one fan visiting from Germany’s Bavaria region told me, “You guys can do your own thing—it’s all right.”) Saskia Jaszoltowski, a musicologist at the University of Graz in Austria, who has studied music in political contexts from the Third Reich to Eurovision, points out that the contest was founded not only with unity in mind but to support the European music industry amid rising U.S. cultural hegemony. That Eurovision is relatively unknown in the United States, however, hardly stopped enthusiastic fans from traveling across the Atlantic this year to support its unifying mission. For them, Eurovision has become custodian to all the values that the Trump administration has left behind.

“This is basically the opposite of the current government,” said one young American man, who arrived in Basel from London draped in stars and rainbow stripes. A trio of men from Chicago, who introduced themselves as “the ‘G’ in LGBTQ+” and who were supporting Israel and Finland, told me that with the shift to the right in the United States and elsewhere, Eurovision’s message of “bringing people together feels especially important.” (The famed ridiculousness, glitz, and everything else they “love to hate” is, to boot, an escape from “all the bullshit.”) Another man expressed surprise at the lack of anti-American sentiment he experienced, given the Trump administration’s recent harassment of European counterparts over tariffs and Russia’s war in Ukraine. The Swiss American standing in front of him warned against a Europhilic romanticism. “There’s a right-wing movement in Europe, too, not only in the U.S.,” she said. Still, America feels like a model of what might happen but hasn’t yet: “Europeans are very watchful and concerned about what’s happening across the Atlantic.”

Three 30-something women in matching, homemade silver hats, out of earshot of this call to caution, told me, wistfully, “I wish we did have something like this in the States.”

The good news for prospective fans is that regardless of where you reside, Eurovision is, first and foremost, a television production, meant to be watched from your living room. Most Europeans will have grown up tuning in with friends and family at watch parties, where it’s common to draw up bingo cards with classic Eurovision cliches and check off the boxes as the show evolves.

Did a Baltic state feature electrofolk heightened by outrageous costumes? Did the United Kingdom win nul points (French and English are the official languages of Eurovision, another postwar legacy) in the combined public vote? Did the French sing in French? (Did they submit, yet again, a defiantly somber ballad in an act of snobbish, yet heroic, defense of good taste?) Did Italy give a boy-band nod to glam rock? Bingo.

This year’s winning card would have also included combat gear from a futuristic space age, boats, flame blasters, and—a major break from recent precedent—lyrics sung in native languages. Eurovision powerhouse Sweden, which introduced the world to ABBA with the pop group’s winning entry, “Waterloo,” in 1974, performed its first non-English song since 1998. Nearly two-thirds of this year’s songs, in fact, were sung in languages other than English, including—in addition to a strong showing in French—Finnish, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, and Portuguese. It’s a strong signal that audiences and artists, if not Europe as a whole, are willing to tilt away from Anglocentrism—and the commercial opportunities that have historically come with it. As a German attendee told me, “They always get an extra point from me if they sing in their native language.”

The final lineup, pruned to 26 acts in the semifinals, also contained two boats, three sequined bustiers, and four mid-song costume changes. (Australian artist Go-Jo, knocked out in the semifinals, would have been the fifth artist to strip on stage, shedding his shirt after emerging from an oversized blender filled with liquid smoke during his performance of “Milkshake Man.”) Latvia brought the obligatory witchy number in six-part harmony, with the entire band dressed as forest nymphs in bronze lamé and fairy crowns; the crowd went wild when, mid-act, they appeared to grow tails, an illusion conjured from the LED backdrop at Basel’s St. Jakobshalle arena. There were two aerial lifts, one in Poland’s “Gaja,” in which 52-year-old popstar Justyna Steczkowska, clad in a slashed leather-like unitard, was raised over the stage by two black ropes reminiscent of BDSM. The second arrived in the cult-favorite “Ich Komme” (“I’m Coming”) from Finland, which ended with sex-positive singer Erika Vikman belting the orgasmic chorus in Finnish and German while soaring on a giant golden microphone stand that, in the final moments, ejaculated—innuendo intended—golden sparks.

The EBU code of conduct explicitly prohibits performers from engaging in “political promotion or related conduct, including actions, statements, or symbols during—or in relation to—the event.” Last year, Israeli contestant Eden Golan was forced to revise her original entry, “October Rain,” for its apparent reference to Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel; the final rendition was titled “Hurricane.” Overt sexual obscenities are also a no-go. This year, Maltese singer Miriana Conte had to revise her punny lyrics just before the submission deadline once the EBU, acting on a complaint filed by the BBC, caught the phonetic resonance between “kant,” the Maltese word for “singing,” and a certain English slur.

Eurovision’s slapstick, self-referential, and sexually provocative aesthetic emerges, in part, from these restrictions. But politics is never entirely eliminated either. A hint of politically charged comic subversion made it onto the final stage via “Espresso Macchiato” by Estonian rapper Tommy Cash, who got his start back home under the moniker “Kanye East” and who has since collaborated with American superstar Charli XCX. An ironic ode to cafe culture sung in an exaggerated Italian accent (“No stresso, no stresso / No need to be depresso”) and laced with questionable Italian stereotypes (“I’m sweating like a mafioso”), the song is a rare example of one country parodying not its own national stereotypes but another’s.

Americans will have also noticed that Cash performed in a navy suit, white shirt, and overly long red tie whose extra footage recalls the trademark neckwear of the current U.S. president, especially when combined with the act’s megalomaniacal backdrops, including a bouncing private plane that flapped its wings along to the beat. (Every surface in the arena was an LED screen ready to burst into each act’s tailored backdrops and animations.) The choreography, furthermore, included a wild shuffle that commentators speculated was an exaggeration of Trump’s signature dance move, the side-to-side alternating fist pump. A clear crowd darling, Estonia came second in the televote, just 39 points behind the public favorite Israel, and third in the contest overall. In the combined vote, Israel was this year’s runner-up with “New Day Will Rise,” sung by Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the Nova music festival massacre on Oct. 7.

The overwhelming theme of this year’s entries was resilience and self-confidence. Part of this is simply the nature of pop, Eurovision’s dominant genre, whose associated themes, Vuletic said, have thus been well represented for years. Resilience was also an unobjectionable choice for a public exhausted by a relentless post-pandemic news cycle, including the controversy over Israel’s participation in Basel.

Yet multiplied through dozens of acts, something about the message began to ring false. “I’m a survivor / Stay aliver,” sang Armenia’s Parg while running on a treadmill, stripped to his waist and slathered in mud, seemingly impeded by nothing other than his own heavy cargo pants and combat boots. “Nothing can bring me down,” belted Norway’s Kyle Alessandro, who kicked off the final with this year’s representative aesthetic of dystopian adventure, as if artists were addressing us from the near future on a planet colonized by Elon Musk and landscaped by artificial intelligence trained on Avatar and Dune. (On this planet, everyone wears formfitting bodysuits, plus or minus, in Alessandro’s case, a Viking-style breastplate.)

The Icelandic Gen-Z duo VAEB shoehorned similar tidings into an Icelandic rap about rowing that somehow managed to combine hoedown instrumentals with the energy of techno. Translated from the Icelandic: “There is nothing that can stop me now”; “If I sink today / It’s no problem.” “Cannot, cannot, cannot, cannot / Cannot ruin me,” echoed Latvia’s ethereal wood nymphs in their Enya-esque harmonies—and in Latvian—while Luxembourg, Malta (“Why should we let other people decide / When we could be having the time of our lives?”), Poland, and Spain gave odes to girl power, celebrating a doll liberated from her marionette strings, “queen energy,” the earth goddess Gaia, and divas, respectively.

Produced in slick pop beats, the music, meanwhile, struck a different mood: party, party, party. From within the arena, at least, it was difficult to detect any sense of the struggle that was so necessary to overcome. A rare exception was Ukraine, which seems to have used the Eurovision license to sing in less-than-fluent English to sneak a possible protest into “Bird of Pray,” which combines Ukrainian and English lyrics. The official chorus reads: “Bird / I’m begging you / Begging you please just / Live.” Sung in pop-rock harmony reminiscent of ABBA, it is indistinguishable from “I’m begging you, begging you, please just leave,” addressed to that more idiomatic of avian species, the bird of prey.

“Politics has always been involved in the contest,” said Vuletic, whose research into Eurovision’s history has focused on just how political a nonpolitical event can be. In the very first competition in 1956, West Germany sent Walter Andreas Schwarz, whose biography as a Holocaust survivor, combined with a song about longing for a better future, sent a strong message about postwar priorities. In 1968, Czech singer Karel Gott won Intervision, a rival song contest hosted in the Soviet bloc during the Cold War, with his song “Tausend Fenster” (“Thousand Windows”), with its allusions to the Iron Curtain. That year, he represented Austria at Eurovision with the same number, during the height of the Prague Spring. Turkey boycotted Eurovision in 1976 in protest of the Greek entry, “Panaghia Mou, Panaghia Mou” (“My Lady, My Lady”), which censured the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. And in 2009, Georgia withdrew after refusing to revise the lyrics to its song “We Don’t Wanna Put In,” a protest song written in response to Russia’s attacks during the Russo-Georgian War the year before. Russia participated in Eurovision from 1994 to 2021 but was expelled by the EBU shortly after invading Ukraine in 2022.

In the wake of that unprecedented expulsion, Israel’s participation in 2024 during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war strained the spirit of “United by Music” nearly to the breaking point. In that year’s host city of Malmo, Sweden, thousands of people took to the streets calling for an end to Israel’s ongoing bombardment and blockade of Gaza—since characterized as genocidal by human rights organizations around the world. Irish contestant Bambie Thug was censored for attempting to perform with the words “Cease-Fire” and “Freedom for Palestine” scrawled in medieval Irish script on their face and legs. Slimane, representing France, paused his dress rehearsal performance to deliver a desperate message of peace and love. Despite the sense that the contest had turned hostile toward Israel, however, the country came second in the public televote.

The mood in Basel this year was calmer, leavened by Swiss neutrality and new rules surrounding contestant speech that Vuletic said were intended to “clamp down even more on the politics” following last year’s scandals. Arriving at St. Jakobshalle to attend the second semifinal, five employees from Basel’s pharma industry, who collectively hailed from Argentina, Ireland, and Uzbekistan, told me that Eurovision was a “light-hearted balance to all the shit that’s going on in the world.” A native of Munich in a tailored, purple-sequined jacket was attending Eurovision for the 12th time because its message had only become more important in recent years. “I really believe very much in the European idea,” he said. When I asked if he was voting for Latvia due to any connection to the country, he responded that this was precisely the beauty of what the contest, at its best, could be: You don’t need a personal connection in order to show enthusiasm for another country’s music, language, or culture.

But dip below the surface, and the quietude quickly transforms to a kind of denialism. The fans I spoke with were uneasy, voicing concerns about the fragility of the project of pan-European integration that Eurovision is meant to support. Two days later, at the final, a France-based Israeli couple, draped in Israeli flags and crowned with headgear of white-and-blue pompoms erected on antennae, recalled the euphoria of Israel hosting the contest in Tel Aviv in 2019, telling me that Eurovision used to feel like a “100 percent party” with “great vibes.” This year, however, was “different.” “We’re happy to be a part of it and to have the opportunity to show our voice,” one said, elaborating on how important it was for Israel to be part of this community. “But it feels a little like we’re the unwanted child.”

The EBU’s posthaste expulsion of Russian broadcasters has become an important object lesson in how, in today’s polarized times, liberal institutions ought to regulate and define terms of inclusion. In an initial statement, published on Feb. 25, 2022—one day after the invasion of Ukraine began—the EBU said “the inclusion of a Russian entry … would bring the competition into disrepute.” In a later statement, published four days later, the union offered different reasoning, explaining that Russia’s broadcasters RTR, Channel One, and RDO were excluded for failing to meet standards of media independence required by union membership. Going into this year’s contest, broadcasters from Iceland, Ireland, Slovenia, and Spain cited the Russian case in calling on the EBU to bar Israel from participating in Basel. More than 70 former participants signed a letter expressing a similar message.

Fans draped in flags clap as they look up at a screen from a amid a large outdoor crowd.

It’s that first statement’s ambiguous reference to “disrepute” that has especially jeopardized the EBU’s claim to neutrality, exposing it to accusations of hypocrisy. Jaszoltowski, the musicologist, called it “rushed.” It was also confusing: The rules for the 2025 contest hold broadcasters responsible for taking “all necessary measures” to prevent Eurovision from being “politicized,” “instrumentalized,” “and/or otherwise brought into disrepute in any way,” while eligibility requirements simply state that a song be under three minutes, invite no more than six performers (and no animals) on stage, and be submitted by a member of the EBU. A country’s broader reputation, however, is nowhere mentioned.

“You can only be part of the European Broadcasting Union,” Jaszoltowski pointed out, if you comply with “freedom of speech, freedom of press, I mean all these values that are in danger in the last couple of years”—terms that require broadcasters, if not their governments, to adhere to a kind of liberal tradition. Yet watchdogs, notably, had tracked threats to Russia’s freedom of press long before 2022: From 2014 to 2022, on Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index, Russia ranked between 148 and 155 out of a total of 180 countries. Today, it has sunk to 171.

Which, then, is the defining criterion—disrepute or freedom of press? In response to a request for comment about its decision regarding the Israeli delegation, the EBU suggested the latter, stating that it is currently “supporting our Israeli member Kan against the threat from being privatized or shut down by the Israeli government,” a reference to a recent motion from far-right parties in the Knesset to bring the public broadcaster under private ownership.

Historically, Eurovision has served the important role of integrating, Jaszoltowski said, “even maybe those who have a hard time being integrated.” From 1961 to 1975, Spain competed under Francisco Franco’s fascist dictatorship, even hosting the contest in 1969, amid protest from other countries. It was an uneasy extension of tolerance practiced by other so-called nonpolitical international events. The Olympics, often held up as an imperfect analogy to the song contest, famously took place in Nazi Germany in 1936, where American sprinter and long jumper Jesse Owens won four gold medals in a legendary refute to the Nazi ideology of Aryan racial supremacy. The 1934 FIFA World Cup took place in Fascist Italy. And as William Lee Adams, who has covered Eurovision for the fansite Wiwibloggs for more than a decade, points out, Russia participated in 2014 after annexing Crimea and, a short time later, passing its anti-LGBTQ+ laws. That same year, Austrian drag queen Conchita Wurst, now a Eurovision legend, won it all: “Eurovision was the response to anti-liberal ideas,” Adams said.

It is precisely because Eurovision is a nonpolitical event that makes it such a rich site for protest and debate—and why unclear decision-making causes such a crisis of legitimacy for liberal institutions that claim to be nonideological. For many sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, the swift response to Russia remains yet another unforgivable case of applying double standards. “My politics don’t align with [Eurovision] at the moment,” said one disappointed fan, a British diversity officer based in Switzerland, attending the second semifinal. She hoped that in the future, the EBU would “walk the talk.” For now, “there’s a lot of hypocrisy.”

For any participating country with an existential reason to gain the ear of the West—in particular, the West without America—Eurovision remains an incredibly powerful platform. In recent years, this has been especially true for Israel and Ukraine. While politicians are barred from the contest (Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s request to address the crowd at the 2023 rendition was denied), broadcasters can still make profound political statements through their choice of contestants. “Of course it is a political statement of the national broadcaster of Israel to send this particular participant who survived the Hamas terror attacks,” said Jaszoltowski, despite the fact that “the song and her lyrics are not political at all.”

It was, by all measures, a successful message. In spite of the French Israeli couple’s sense that Israel was “unwanted” at the contest, Raphael’s “New Day Will Rise” won second place, notably sweeping the public vote. Even Spain, whose participating broadcaster called for Israel’s exclusion, allotted 12 points—the maximum allowed—to Israel in the public vote. So did the rest of Eurovision’s most populous participating countries, including Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the catchall category, “Rest of the World.” (The reason Israel did not win the contest is that in the jury vote, decided by music industry experts, it came 14th, with 60 points to Austria’s winning 258. Votes are also not weighted by population; 12 points from Luxembourg, which Israel also earned, count the same as 12 points from Spain.)

Two disturbances took place during Raphael’s acts, one during a semifinal dress rehearsal and another during the final; in both cases, protesters were swiftly handed over to the police or security personnel. It is awful to contemplate the trauma that the survivor of a terrorist attack might have experienced during these disruptions. Multiple pro-Palestinian demonstrations took place in central Basel, at least one drawing hundreds of people, who called for Israel’s expulsion from the contest and a cease-fire in Gaza. On the other hand, the only demonstration to make it within visible range of the arena was a group of 20 or so local Christians waving Israeli flags just beyond the police boundary, who told me that they had gathered to support Israel’s right to defend itself and to protest antisemitism and the lack of neutrality toward Israel in the popular press. When I asked the group’s spokesperson for his views on the plight of residents of Gaza enduring the latest expansion of Israel’s military campaign—which has only added to the Palestinian death toll of more than 53,000—he said it was a “big problem.”

“But this is politics,” he added. In other words, beyond the scope of Eurovision.

There were no Palestinian fans to interview in Basel, of course, because Palestine’s bid to enter Eurovision was rejected in 2007 on the basis that its broadcaster did not meet standards for full EBU membership. Gaza does not currently have stable access to telecommunications services, let alone a functioning health care system. The vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza, furthermore, are currently prohibited from leaving the territory except under highly restricted circumstances—which do not include being the wild, campy, musical savants whom Eurovision attracts. One can only imagine what message a hypothetical Palestinian delegation would have chosen to send through its own contestant or song selection or how the public might have responded. Expelling Israel from the contest is unlikely to have improved the audience’s capacity to conjure such a counterfactual, just as the EBU’s expulsion of Russia failed to end the war in Ukraine. It was the absence of Palestinian voices, rather than Israel’s presence, that haunted St. Jakobshalle: On the night of the final, in a football stadium with ticketed spillover seating for 36,000, I spotted three wan Palestinian flags.

JJ holds up both hands one with a mic and one with a trophy as confetti falls on a stage.

The voting patterns at this year’s Eurovision painted a portrait of a Western world—or at least of its European remainder—that is having trouble making up its mind. The winner, Austria’s virtuosic JJ, a classically trained countertenor with the Vienna State Opera, won with 436 points, the lowest winning total since the latest version of the rank-choice voting system was introduced in 2016. (Switzerland won last year’s contest with a whopping 591 points, while in 2022 Ukraine totaled 631.) The lower the number of points it takes to secure victory, the more national juries and viewers have scattered their loyalties across countries.

Austria’s win was a surprise to anyone who followed the bookies, who had KAJ, the Finnish comedy group representing Sweden with a spoof on sauna culture, in the lead for weeks. JJ’s triumph was not a surprise, however, for anyone who listened closely to the 26 finalists as a sample of an uneasy, confused liberal zeitgeist. KAJ’s comedic, self-congratulatory call to crank up the heat (translated from the Swedish: “Steam it up and let go of all stress today” / “Sauna brothers, we’re the ones who glow”) might have been received as a welcome call to escape. But for the juries, amid all that’s happening in the world, it read, perhaps, as another expression of exhaustion.

No wonder Estonia’s entry was such a crowd-pleaser, snatching the second-place finish in the televote: The enigmatic combo of Cash’s Trumpian suit with lines such as “Life is like spaghetti / It’s hard until you make it” is exactly the kind of uninterpretable, politically adjacent irony that resonates in a nihilistic moment. There is the sense that someone, somewhere, ought to be offended by such a song—but you, dear listener, are in on the joke.

JJ, by contrast, who won over the national juries and placed fourth in the public vote, performed in black and white on a sailboat lost in the middle of a simulated ocean, as if Tom Hanks had trained at a Viennese conservatory before starring in Cast Away. For “Wasted Love” tells a story of heartbreak and despair: “You left me in the deep end / I’m drowning in my feelings.” The sense that the world is, in fact, full of pain that is overcome only through struggle, discomfort, and great investment of time was heightened by the actually operatic vocals.

Halfway through the song, a whirlpool appeared on the stage floor as JJ began to struggle forward, steering the flimsy dinghy against an imaginary tempest. The choreographed struggle to stay upright against an invisible wind as a dark club beat dropped and strobe lights spliced the broadcast into a series of freeze-frames was pure Eurovision: exaggerated, melodramatic, decidedly overdone. But uniquely among the acts, it might have also hit a note of truth.

Even before his inauguration, Trump threatened South Africa and other members of the BRICS international grouping with 100 percent tariffs if they pursued the creation of a new currency that would serve as an alternative to the dollar. (South Africa denied any such plans.)

For weeks now, egged on by his South African-born mega-billionaire advisor Elon Musk, U.S. President Donald Trump has been ratcheting up a campaign to inflict damage on South Africa, a country already beset with grave economic, racial, and historic problems.

For weeks now, egged on by his South African-born mega-billionaire advisor Elon Musk, U.S. President Donald Trump has been ratcheting up a campaign to inflict damage on South Africa, a country already beset with grave economic, racial, and historic problems.

Even before his inauguration, Trump threatened South Africa and other members of the BRICS international grouping with 100 percent tariffs if they pursued the creation of a new currency that would serve as an alternative to the dollar. (South Africa denied any such plans.)

Then, in one of its early moves, the Trump administration cut off aid to Pretoria in February on the pretext that it was committing “massive human rights violations” against members of its white minority population. This came in direct response to South Africa’s new land law, which allows the government to expropriate property in limited circumstances to address apartheid-era land inequality. No land has been seized under the law.

The following month, the U.S. State Department declared South Africa’s ambassador to the United States persona non grata and expelled him on short notice, accusing him of being a “race-baiting politician” who hates Trump.

But this was mere prelude to Trump’s outrageous treatment of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House on Wednesday, which was reminiscent of Trump’s confrontation in February with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the elaborate setup that unfolded, Trump dimmed the lights of the Oval Office to project footage purporting to show mass graves of white farmers in South Africa who, he claimed, were victims of an ongoing genocide.

This was false. The press quickly debunked the supposed evidence that Trump offered, from inaccurate footage of a burial site to a photo that was not, in fact, from South Africa, but rather the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

For his part, Ramaphosa gently rebutted Trump and brought prominent Afrikaners, the descendants of mostly Dutch migrants, to lend their testimonials in rejection of the genocide claims and plea for better relations with Washington. They spoke about South Africa’s crime problem—it has one of the world’s highest murder rates—and asked Washington for help.

Trump, who admitted no error, was not chastened and made no offers of assistance. His unacceptable behavior at the meeting can only be described as racist.

A quick look back helps explain how South Africa got to its present situation. Long past are the optimistic days that followed the end of apartheid, a system of formal white supremacist rule, in 1994. Apartheid formally endured for 46 years, but it was preceded by a far longer period of white domination over both Indigenous groups and an economy that produced enormous wealth through gold and diamond mining and other forms of extraction.

In what much of the world applauded as a kind of miracle, South Africa emerged from apartheid under the wise and generous leadership of Nelson Mandela. He had spent 27 years of a life sentence in prison—nearly six of them in solitary confinement—for his opposition to South Africa’s legally enforced racial separatism and inequality. Despite the many cruelties imposed on him, his family, and those he had struggled with to achieve justice, Mandela governed as an advocate of national unification across racial lines.

Unfortunately, what ensued was not quite miraculous. Mandela’s deep humanity, soft touch, and warmth were not enough to solve South Africa’s problems. He had shortcomings as a leader, too, with no effective strategy for boosting the economic development of a country that was the richest in Africa but among the most unequal in the world.

As a journalist who briefly covered South Africa during the Mandela years, I have long believed that its best chance at economic transformation back then was leading the economic integration of the entire southern half of the African continent, which had poor infrastructure but immense hydroelectric potential and mineral wealth. This would have given big opportunities to South Africa and its enterprises in sectors such as communications and mining while also helping the region break with a long era of Western domination that yielded little development.

Mandela, however, showed uneasiness about adopting any kind of regional leadership mantle and favored a more humble approach in engaging his neighbors, which had given decades of support to South Africa in its struggle against apartheid. His inaction squandered his country’s unique opportunity and the economic gains that might have come from it. It also helped create the vacuum that China stepped into, becoming the dominant builder and trading partner in Africa since the late 1990s.

Since then, South Africa has fallen prey to stalled economic growth, high unemployment, a decline in governance, and even worse inequality. It is also a victim of great structural imbalances in the global economy that have made rapid and sustained economic advancement rare in the so-called global south. All these factors have fueled a more quotidian crisis—a plague of violent crime—that has made South Africa into one of the most dangerous countries in the world. My own brother, who lived there for years, was robbed at gunpoint three times, including a home invasion in which he narrowly avoided being shot. The reality is that Black South Africans are overwhelmingly the victims.

Of the 26,232 murders committed last year in South Africa, a country of approximately 60 million people, only 44 were linked to farming communities, and just eight of the victims were farmers. (Trump’s baseless claims of white genocide in the country have centered on farmers.)

Nearly all of Trump’s comments during his encounter with Ramaphosa showed his deep ignorance of South Africa, but none more than his readiness to believe in white victimhood at the hands of Black people.

Why this fixation on race? Genocide is not a word that should be thrown around lightly—especially not in a world that abounds in situations of mass violence and persecution that are orders of magnitude greater than any suffering faced by white South Africans, who generally lead lives of comfort.

It helps to look beyond South Africa to make sense of this. Trump has repeatedly deplored the loss of life among Russian and Ukrainian soldiers as “horrible,” while staying silent about large-scale wartime killing in, say, Sudan.

This is a president who has sought to criminalize dissent against the Israeli military’s killing of more than 53,000 Palestinians in Gaza—a number that rises above 60,000 when the missing are added—which human rights groups and well-qualified Jewish critics have called a genocide. Trump has shown crass indifference to the destruction of virtually all of Gaza and impassiveness in the face of ever stronger indications that Israel intends to seize the territory and banish as many Palestinians as possible. All the while, he has clung to a grotesque fantasy of turning Gaza into an exclusive real estate development for the wealthy.

Somehow, though, fabricated stories of white South Africans facing property seizures and violence are the moral outrage of the moment. It is hard to understand this except by facing the fact that Trump is an individual with a history of anti-Black racism and bias.

Trump was likely influenced by Musk, who bears deep and unresolved personal grievances about the society he grew up in amid great privilege. (Just a day before Ramaphosa visited the White House, Musk berated an interviewer at a conference in Qatar for not acknowledging South Africa’s supposedly “racist” laws.)

As Trump said during his meeting with Ramaphosa, “this is what Elon wanted.” Trump has a habit of deflecting responsibility. But in the way he received Ramaphosa and spoke about South Africa, his disregard for truth, moral numbness, and capacity for indecency rose to a level best described as obscenity. He cannot be let off so easily.

Trump’s calumnies against South Africa are of a piece with his treatment of Africa in general, a continent he has said is full of “shithole countries.” These, in turn, seem related to the president’s domestic campaign against diversity in the military, government, academia, and elsewhere. He and Musk seem to share an abiding unwillingness to understand why overcoming systems of discrimination that lasted centuries, both formal and informal, might require intentional government policies, or even why this effort might be worthwhile.

Trump, meanwhile, has openly longed for immigration from places such as Norway, all while deploring people from nonwhite countries—not just African ones—as a threat to the United States, just as Musk has inveighed against immigration to Europe from other continents.

I have used the word grotesque already here, and I am running out of adjectives to describe what is transpiring in the United States today. It is a reversion to the open racism of presidents long past—leaders such as Woodrow Wilson and Andrew Johnson, who sought to roll back the clock on recognizing the virtues and rights of people of non-European descent. This is happening in America, but it is profoundly un-American. It makes a mockery of the words in the Declaration of Independence, which proclaims that all people are created equal.

Trump’s behavior should not be lightly dismissed as boorishness. It must be recognized for what it really is: a menace to the integrity of the society that gave him the world’s most powerful platform.

But facing bankruptcy in 1996, the company sold its Mac factory in Colorado to a U.S. contract manufacturer and started down a long road of outsourcing manufacturing, first in the United States and later in Asia. It now builds most everything it sells in China. Outsourcing has been incredibly lucrative for Apple, helping to make it one of the three most valuable companies in the world, as measured by market capitalization. But it also has made Apple frighteningly dependent on the shifting whims of Chinese politics and the priorities of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

In the early 1990s, Apple was determined to show it could continue to build computers in the United States as part of its strategy of keeping tight control over every aspect of design and production.

But facing bankruptcy in 1996, the company sold its Mac factory in Colorado to a U.S. contract manufacturer and started down a long road of outsourcing manufacturing, first in the United States and later in Asia.

Outsourcing has been incredibly lucrative for Apple, helping to make it one of the three most valuable companies in the world, as measured by market capitalization. But it also has made Apple frighteningly dependent on the shifting whims of Chinese politics and the priorities of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Apple in China: The Capture of the World’s Greatest Country, by former Financial Times reporter Patrick McGee, who has long covered Apple, tells the tale of this Faustian bargain in bold, vivid strokes. It’s a great read and an informative guide to how Apple and China truly operate—one that global leaders (and Silicon Valley bigwigs) should pay heed to.

“It would be banal to say that Apple wouldn’t be Apple today without China,” McGee writes. “What this book contends is more intriguing—that China wouldn’t be China today without Apple.” Hyperbolic to be sure, but McGee makes his case convincingly.

The secret sauce to Apple’s outsourcing is what McGee calls “the Apple Squeeze.” To make sure foreign factories can meet Apple’s exacting standards, Apple flies in its engineers to “rigorously train local partners” how to mass produce new technology items at low prices, and “in the process giving away manufacturing knowledge.” In exchange, contractors charge Apple lowball prices and operate at the thinnest of margins, or sometimes no profit at all.

As demanding as Apple is, it has plenty of suitors. Contractors know they can use the knowledge and prominence they gain from working with Apple to win contracts from other companies willing to pay higher prices. Beijing encourages Chinese firms to work with Apple, McGee argues, because it understands that Apple is providing a massive transfer of manufacturing knowhow. Over the years, Apple has trained a huge cadre of Chinese engineers and managers, and its contractors have employed millions of Chinese workers.

McGee calls Apple “the world’s largest manufacturer without owning factories.”

A couple of caveats before we continue: Apple in China tells the Apple story as a heroic tale. McGee describes the celebrated CEOs—Apple’s Steve Jobs and Tim Cook, Foxconn’s Terry Gou—as brilliant and demanding, and their underlings as perfectionist and hard-driving. If any of them have faults, it’s arrogance and ignoring their families. This sometimes gets to be too much, like listening to a person who says his biggest flaw is that he works too hard.

There also isn’t a word in the book about how Apple and its Silicon Valley compadres who shed factory jobs in the U.S. contributed to the shock of soaring Chinese imports. McGee is nearly as silent about horrendous working conditions at some of Apple’s China suppliers. For instance, he chides journalists for focusing too much on suicides at Foxconn, Apple’s biggest contract supplier in China, and missing the bigger story of Apple’s progress in China.

“Periodic exposes helped to shine a light on working conditions and likely caused some positive change,” he writes. “But the media’s forays into what Apple was up to overlooked wider questions of company strategy, business development, and the management of product cycles.”

Still, the story McGee does tell—Apple’s growth in China and its impact on the country—he tells well. He manages to turn supply chain decisions into high drama and make injection molding seem sexy.

Starting in the mid-1980s, Apple experimented with foreign contract manufacturing. It turned to Canon in Japan to produce its first laser printer, the LaserWriter. Japanese firms also produced some Apple laptops and the Newton, a disaster of a product that used a stylus to take notes and send emails.

It wasn’t until Apple lurched toward bankruptcy in the mid-1990s that it turned fully to outsourcing. It dabbled with manufacturing in South Korea, Singapore, Ireland, Wales, and Mexico. But it hit paydirt in Taiwan with Foxconn, whose CEO, Gou, was as obsessive and perfectionist as Jobs.

But Taiwan’s worker population was limited, as was its space for expansion. Gou, a leader in the generation of Taiwanese CEOs who invested heavily in China, shifted Apple production to the mainland. There the working population seemed unlimited, and the government offered subsidies, infrastructure, and the necessary working conditions for success—meaning that it cracked down on independent worker associations and turned a blind eye to child labor and scandalous overtime demands. Apple consolidated its manufacturing, which had been spread all over Asia, into China.

Protesters dressed in white gear as factory workers hold large fake iPads during a protest.

A huge cheap labor pool was crucial. The work was so tedious and competition for labor so intense that turnover in electronics contract manufacturers could reach 300 percent to 400 percent annually.

Of course, many other Western companies were lured to China along with Apple, often in joint venture arrangements, which became a way for local partners to purloin Western technology. Apple worked hard to avoid that trap.

In California, Apple designers came up with innovative products like the iPod and iPhone which didn’t use off-the-shelf parts. Apple trained local firms to produce advanced components at scale and low price but also limited their ability to copy Apple products. One way was by purchasing the expensive computerized machinery necessary to make Apple products for contract manufacturers—and making sure the manufacturers used them only for Apple.

Apple’s engineers tried to imbue Chinese manufacturers with Apple’s perfectionism while protecting Apple’s intellectual property. “Instead of selecting components off the shelf,” McGee writes, “Apple was designing custom parts, crafting the manufacturing behind them, and orchestrating their assembly into enormously complex systems” that were difficult to replicate. The idea, McGee says, was to “build moats around its manufacturing innovations.”

When it came to dealing with China’s complex political system, Apple initially relied on Gou, or Uncle Terry, as he was known in Apple. Gou understood how Beijing operated and was a pro at scoring the free land, infrastructure, and other subsidies that local governments gave to manufacturers. Officials’ careers benefitted from factories that hired loads of local workers and furthered the central government’s goal of improving electronics manufacturing. Pleasing Beijing meant promotions for the local officials Gou wooed.

But by around 2013, Apple had gotten so big in China that it started to attract unwanted attention and was sometimes portrayed in the local media as a bullying Western company, particularly as China’s new leader, Xi Jinping, consolidated power, and U.S.-China relations began to crater. Apple assembled what it called “the Gang of Eight”—managers with China experience—to try to manage dicey political relations. They learned the difference between the Western notion of “rule of law,” where courts are supposed to deal out verdicts impartially, and the Chinese practice of “rule by law,” where the Communist Party sets the rules, McGee shows. As the CCP sees it, it’s their law, they rule.

Apple’s enormous reliance on China for manufacturing, which had fattened its bottom line, had begun to become a weakness it had to address. Apple tried a variety of tactics.

When Beijing asked Apple to remove apps from its Chinese App Store, Apple dropped the New York Times and 674 different VPN apps that had enabled Chinese users to jump the Great Firewall of China and download banned content. But Apple wouldn’t go so far as to ban the Times from its global App Store, as China requested.

Apple also invested in Chinese companies that it thought were favored by the government, including the ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing, and chipmaker YMTC. It chose impoverished Guizhou province for a new data center because it bet the governor there would be appointed to the ruling Politburo Standing Committee. (He wasn’t, and Apple dropped the project in 2022.)

It also started shifting away from Taiwanese-owned manufacturers to Chinese-owned ones, creating what McGee calls a “red supply chain.” Meanwhile in meetings with Chinese officials, Apple execs stressed how it was transferring manufacturing technology to China and claimed it was investing $55 billion annually in the country, and in 2016 told Chinese officials it planned to spend $275 billion over five years, although McGee doesn’t clearly explain how it arrived at those numbers.

Apple sought to show it was in lockstep with Xi’s vision of turning China into a technology superpower. “The technology transfer that Apple facilitated made it the biggest corporate supporter of Made in China 2025,” Beijing’s controversial plan to make China a global leader in crucial technologies, McGee writes.

How did Apple manage to do all this without becoming a pariah in Washington? Sadly, McGee has little to contribute on that end. He notes that Cook met fairly regularly with Donald Trump during his first term, but he doesn’t have details on what they discussed. Apple products were among those exempted from tariffs during Trump’s first trade war with China. Coincidence? The reader is left to wonder.

Trump 1.0 also did Apple a huge favor by barring exports of advanced semiconductors to Apple’s most formidable Chinese competitor, Huawei. For a time, Huawei’s revenues plummeted, although it has recovered since then. Was Apple simply a lucky bystander to Washington’s crackdown or did Cook push Trump in that direction? McGee leans toward the former explanation but given that Cook appears to leave nothing to chance, that seems unlikely.

Another Apple priority was reducing its reliance on chips produced in Taiwan by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). From my own reporting, I know that Apple was pushing TSMC to bring some of its manufacturing to the United States, which it is in the process of doing after the United States awarded it billions of dollars in subsidies through the CHIPS Act.

Three people in a line look down at their phones as they stand in front of a display with the latest iPhone behind them.

Of course, the book was finished before Trump’s latest trade war, so it can’t tackle recent events. Apple products, like other electronic goods, were exempted from most of the super-high tariffs Trump levied on Beijing, which recently were paused for 90 days. Now Cook is trying to win favor in Washington in the same way he did in Beijing, with a promise to spend huge amounts in the country. Apple has pledged it will spend $500 billion domestically over the next four years of Trump’s presidency, which includes orders it doles out to U.S. suppliers.

But Trump might be tougher to lobby than Xi. Just the other day, Trump threatened to hit Apple with at least 25 percent tariffs on any iPhones produced outside the United States, no matter the country, even though building them domestically would be far more costly and increase iPhone prices.

For all of Apple’s technological skill and political acumen, it now finds itself utterly reliant on China at a time when U.S.-China relations have become frigid and may have already descended into a new Cold War. Apple is looking to invest more in India to diversify production, McGee points out, but that’s a long-term project—if it succeeds at all.

Even if more final assembly is done in India, much of innards still come from China, where competitors now produce phones comparable to Apple’s. And Apple’s unique way of controlling outsourced manufacturing, especially buying the production machinery for contractors, means that scaling up production in India could cost it hundreds of billions of dollars.

Then there is the question of whether China would let Apple leave. Beijing has so many levers it can pull—antitrust investigations, regulatory problems, shipping delays, and so on—that Apple might feel the cost is too high to alienate Beijing.

As Doug Guthrie, one of the Apple Gang of Eight, wrote after he left the company: “Quite simply, you don’t get to do business in China today without doing what the Chinese government wants you to do. Period. No one is immune. No one.”

Germany’s 10th postwar chancellor is only weeks into office, but judgments were being made about him even before he took over. Most of these are influenced by a national propensity to see the glass as half-empty. Yet, at the age of 69, Merz knows he doesn’t have long to make a mark.

Few world leaders have taken up the job so late in life yet have so little experience. Few can have won an election and been so unpopular even on victory. Few can have faced the enormity of the challenges that Friedrich Merz faces with so little confidence among his citizens that he can meet them.

Germany’s 10th postwar chancellor is only weeks into office, but judgments were being made about him even before he took over. Most of these are influenced by a national propensity to see the glass as half-empty. Yet, at the age of 69, Merz knows he doesn’t have long to make a mark.

Who exactly is he? A spate of biographies, published early in the election campaign, shed a little light. A new book adopts a different approach. Mariam Lau, a journalist at the weekly Die Zeit and one of the most authoritative experts on German conservatism, takes a thematic approach in Merz: Auf der Suche nach der verlorenen Mitte. She seeks to explain how Merz will deal with the likes of Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and how he’ll try to kick-start the German economy. She asks whether he has a problem with women (he has been accused of being patronizing or sexist) and whether he would be ready to wage war for his country.

Lau begins by probing his past and a grandfather whose prominent support for the Nazis is being increasingly chewed over in the media; it is making the requirement even more urgent that Merz succeeds in the task he has set himself—to distance his Christian Democrat-led government from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) while differentiating it from the legacy of former Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The picture emerging of Merz is of a man whose flaws are open for all to see but whose resilience is underestimated. The subtitle of Lau’s book—“The Search for the Lost Center Ground”—makes clear that this is the direction in which he wishes to head. Yet, if that is so, he sometimes has a strange way of showing it. As Lau writes, Merz has a track record of getting himself in trouble. “One could almost speak of the ‘Merz Disease,’” she writes, “airing a resentment, doubling down on it when faced with headwinds, only to have to give in at some point.”

The author seeks to disentangle two extraordinary U-turns that Merz took during the election period. Having said he would never deal with the AfD, in late January he submitted a motion in the Bundestag, Germany’s parliament, advocating a clampdown on immigration, knowing that the only way it would pass would be with support from the far right. The bid failed because of a rebellion from furious MPs within his own ranks.

A few weeks later, having insisted that he would not contemplate loosening the “debt brake” that severely restricted public borrowing, he did just that. By a sleight of hand, he used the outgoing parliament to pass a constitutional change allowing for a huge injection of money for spending on defense and public infrastructure. He was now denounced by all sides as untrustworthy, too. Lau contends that he had little choice but that he could have acted earlier. The execution may have looked unprincipled, but Germany has ended up in a better place—finally giving itself the tools to grow and modernize.

The first about-turn had no such caveats. It was an unmitigated disaster, one that has left a lingering suspicion about his relationship to the AfD. Some of Merz’s allies want to remove the “firewall” that rules out cooperation with the party at the regional and national levels. He insists he will not do so.

Instead, he wants to weaken the appeal of the far right by dealing with its signature issue—immigration. On day one of his leadership, he instructed Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt to impose border checks and to turn asylum-seekers away at the border. Whether it succeeds in bringing down illegal migration or increases confidence in the state’s ability to control overall figures—rather than being purely performative (there’s little stopping people trying again and again to get in)—is another matter. His partners in the coalition, the Social Democrats, are prepared to go along with it.

Far more open is the approach to the economy. The Social Democratic Party has watered down Merz’s commitments to cut Germany’s generous welfare payments or to countenance other radical reforms to the tax code or pensions system. As Lau notes, the entire structure of modern Germany was based on stability and on removing the opportunities for leaders to seize untrammeled power. The Basic Law (the constitution enacted in 1949) ensured that coalitions were required to be formed at all levels of government; power was shared, only involving moderate parties, and the regional states enjoyed considerable autonomy. Leaders such as Konrad Adenauer, Germany’s first postwar chancellor, “stood for a break with all things ideological, as well as for stability, reconciliation, a longing for normality and democratic boredom.”

It was in that spirit that Merkel also navigated her 16 years in power, seeing the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as the party of small steps. She and Merz fell out early—each accusing the other of undermining them. She publicly attacked his parliamentary flirtation with the AfD. He has regular trashed her legacy and what he calls her “asylum-hugging” and “green-hugging.” Merkel recently tried a gesture of reconciliation, appearing as a visitor to the Bundestag to watch Merz’s confirmation as chancellor, only to witness him suffering the ignominy of becoming the first candidate to be voted down. By the time he was elected in a second ballot a few hours later, she was gone.

Lau quotes another writer on conservatism, Edmund Fawcett: “‘[C]onservatives have largely created and learned to dominate a liberal modern world in which they cannot feel at home.’” She continues: “The question of how the insistence on tradition and attachment to one’s homeland are compatible with creative destruction, without which there would be no prosperity and no free market economy, for example, is one that an economic liberal like Friedrich Merz must ask himself.” This goes to the heart of the Merz problem, indeed a problem facing all mainstream center-right parties: How do they reconcile traditionalism with the need for change?

With the British Conservatives languishing in fourth place in opinion polls, and similar parties floundering, is the only route to success the one taken by the likes of Trump—a mix of maximum economic and democratic disruption alongside a so-called return to traditional social values?

Until recently, Lau notes, Merz hated being called a conservative. If he was to be given that moniker, he demanded that the word “progressive” be added to it. Anything else would be seen as “unsafe” or tending toward the extreme. Now, she says, it has gone from a term of abuse to a badge of pride. At the same time, he must run a centrist coalition (roughly where all German governments end up), leaving him open to pushback from the left and fury from the right.

There may be a way through, she suggests, one that can align the different factions: “Merz is also an enthusiastic modernist, in the technological sense. Fusion reactors, carbon dumping in the ground, space travel, mRNA vaccines—the CDU leader is an enthusiastic supporter of the idea that a country like Germany, which is poor in raw materials, should draw much more growth from its wealth of inventions.”

This will not be easy. Old habits, such as a reluctance to embrace digitization and an overreliance on bureaucracy, are embedded. Will Merz take risks to modernize the country? In his speeches so far, he seems to have tended in both directions: in some, seeking to reassure, in others, not shying away from controversy—such as suggesting workers don’t put in enough hours.

Lau also notes a very German set of cliches associated with Merz that will likely always pose a democratic obstacle: “The old white man; the rich, ruthless man; the neoliberal; the unpopular man—behind this dreary folklore lies the rock-solid conviction of many Germans that it is ultimately simply not OK to be right-wing, politically relevant, and then also rich.”

Merz may well do what other leaders have done when confronted by domestic resilience—devote most of their tenure to foreign affairs. He certainly has much on his plate and has already shown dexterity. He has responded quickly to the denunciations of Germany and Europe by senior figures in the Trump administration by making clear the need not just for rearmament but for a new approach to European self-reliance. His overtures to Paris, London, and Warsaw were striking, and the continent’s new security inner core has shown commendable unity toward Ukraine.

Far less certain, and far less commendable, has been Germany’s refusal to countenance any significant criticism of Israel’s near-destruction of Gaza. Merz is following Merkel and others in their guilt-laden paralysis on the issue; indeed, his embrace of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is all the more pronounced.

Lau concludes with the following exhortation: Merz, she says, “is a conservative in an era of authoritarians who must earn the title ‘conservative’ again and again because he occasionally squanders it.” The German business model, with cheap energy from Russia, the Chinese sales market, and the U.S. security guarantee, has hit the wall. The rules-based international order is in tatters; military experts call the current phase “prewar.” She quotes him as saying, “The political center is capable of solving problems.”

With the center cracking all over the Western world, the task the new German chancellor faces is unenviable.

The U.N. was created in the wake of World War II to advance peace and security and prevent another world war. Over time, its mission has expanded to address a wide range of topics, from development and humanitarian relief to human rights, disarmament, the climate crisis, and public health.

In his first budget proposal since returning to office, U.S. President Donald Trump is taking a chainsaw approach to the United Nations—similar to the one he’s taken with U.S. government departments and agencies. His administration is seeking to cut billions of dollars of U.S. funding for U.N. operations, including peacekeeping missions. Shrinking support for the U.N. and similar organizations has long been a pet cause for conservative hardliners. This time, they might succeed, given congressional dynamics. If so, the result would be a seismic shift in global power—one where multilateralism survives, but increasingly on China’s terms.

The U.N. was created in the wake of World War II to advance peace and security and prevent another world war. Over time, its mission has expanded to address a wide range of topics, from development and humanitarian relief to human rights, disarmament, the climate crisis, and public health.

Almost 80 years later, one can credibly argue that the U.N. has succeeded in its primary goal of preventing another global war and has done transformative work on a myriad of issues. However, one must also concede that the U.N. is anachronistic and in need of serious reform. The Biden administration sought to work within the system to improve the effectiveness and focus of multilateral institutions. The Trump administration, by contrast, seems inclined to walk away.

We already know what multilateralism looks like without the United States because we’ve tried it before. During the first Trump administration, the United States withdrew from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), as well as the U.N. Human Rights Council, and largely disengaged from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

The experience has shown that multilateralism can survive without U.S. participation. While the United States has been the U.N. system’s largest funder, it’s not the only one. If the United States steps back, its influence will fade—it will lose voting power, forfeit seats at key tables, and leave space for China to shape the agenda.

Take the ITU, led by a Chinese national from 2015 to 2022. The ITU is the world’s telecom referee, setting standards and norms for internet and satellite communications. During Houlin Zhao’s time as secretary-general, Beijing leveraged its position to promote its preferred technical standards, as well as the interests of Chinese companies. China, Russia, and other authoritarian states also pushed to impose constraints on the internet—measures that some argued could embed authoritarianism into the web’s architecture.

This is not just about great-power competition. It’s about setting the global rules of the road for how all countries operate, and many of these norms originate within the U.N. system. With the proliferation of artificial intelligence, institutions like the ITU and UNESCO will be pivotal in addressing risks such as misinformation and algorithmic bias. By removing itself from these deliberations, the United States cedes the opportunity to shape global standards, allowing countries with different views on privacy and human rights to define the future. That will ultimately disadvantage the U.S. tech companies currently leading the world in AI development.

The United States needs to decide what kind of world it wants to live in and work to shape it. Back in 1945, it designed the U.N. in its image and imprinted U.N. organizations and norms with American values. It built the greatest home-field advantage in global affairs. That doesn’t guarantee the United States always wins, but it gives the country a better shot than anyone else. It allows the United States to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, coordinate sanctions on North Korea, and mobilize joint responses to crises like the one in Haiti.

If the United States walks away from the U.N. and other multilateral institutions, it will forfeit that playbook and let others write the rules. And because U.N. hiring decisions often correlate with financial contributions, the United States will quickly and painfully realize that the U.N. staff writing the next generation of global norms won’t be American.

And for what? In 2023, the United States provided $13 billion to U.N. organizations—just 0.2 percent of the federal budget. For global influence, that’s a bargain compared to the 13 percent of the total federal budget for 2023 that it spent on defense alone.

To be sure, the U.N. is far from perfect and must be modernized for the 21st century. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has started a long-overdue reform process, proposing consolidation of overlapping agencies, shifting functions from costly cities like New York and Geneva to more affordable locales, and mandating staff reductions.

That’s a good start. But far bolder action is needed to reimagine where the U.N. can deliver the most value—and which legacy functions are no longer sustainable. Much of the reporting and translation functions can and should be automated. The benefits for staff should be less generous, in keeping with the standards today. And the proposed merging of agencies should eliminate many of the higher-level positions that will be made redundant. Nevertheless, this kind of structural reset will require the consensus of 193 member states—a political feat only possible through sustained and constructive U.S. engagement, relentless diplomacy, and principled compromise.

Walking away from multilateral institutions won’t create a vacuum—it will create an opening, one that China is already poised to fill. For the first time ever, the United States is skipping this month’s World Health Assembly, which is hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO), a U.N. agency that Trump withdrew from during his first term and now plans to exit again. Meanwhile, China has pledged $500 million to the WHO, replacing the United States as the largest donor and giving Beijing significant leverage to shape global health policy.

The U.N. and its sister institutions won’t vanish without the United States, but they will evolve in ways that reflect other countries’ values and priorities. In an era of rising authoritarianism and rapid technological change, that evolution won’t be neutral. The Trump administration is tired of the United States shouldering the burden for leading the world. But history shows that when democracies retreat, autocracies rush in to take their place.

Fortunately, Taiwan is finally taking its self-defense seriously. This is important for many reasons, not least of which is that an “America First” president will not help a country unwilling to help itself.

The Taiwan Strait may be the most likely candidate for the place that sets off World War III. Until recently, however, Taiwan was not acting like a country facing a growing threat of invasion from a ruthless, nuclear-armed, great-power neighbor that has made its intent to control the island abundantly clear.

Fortunately, Taiwan is finally taking its self-defense seriously. This is important for many reasons, not least of which is that an “America First” president will not help a country unwilling to help itself.

I have had the privilege of visiting Taiwan on annual delegation trips for the past several years, and the change in Taiwan’s defense posture over that period has been nothing short of remarkable.

As late as 1990, after all, the Taiwanese military spent time and resources planning for Taiwan’s possible invasion of mainland China—a long-standing dream since Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek retreated to the island after losing the Chinese civil war, but now little more than a pipe dream given the power imbalances between the two sides.

U.S. defense officials have often been frustrated by Taiwan’s approach to military procurement, with its military requesting purchases of flashy and expensive weapons platforms—such as F-35 aircraft—that are ill-suited for the most likely threats it faces. Countering a Chinese amphibious invasion or blockade requires asymmetric capabilities—such as anti-ship missiles—not big, expensive targets for Chinese missile salvos.

Just two years ago, my colleagues and I toured one of the Taiwanese Navy’s corvettes. A former senior U.S. official asked them what they would do after the ship ended up at the bottom of the Strait 15 minutes after the start of a war with China.

The West prioritizes civilian leadership of the military, but the Taiwanese Defense Ministry has often been led by hidebound military officers. Taiwan’s military culture was formed under the Kuomintang’s authoritarian rule, pro-Beijing in its sympathies and resistant to reform. A previous attempt to install a civilian defense minister in 2013, for example, was resisted by the ranks and lasted all of six days.

As one example of this problem, I asked a senior Taiwanese military officer several years ago about the Chinese nuclear threat. He replied that he was not too worried because Chinese President Xi Jinping would never use nuclear weapons against Taiwan because they are all Chinese people.

Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president from 2016 to 2024, was a strong leader who understood the threat from China. In attempting to balance defense strategy with societal and economic stability, she worried that focusing too publicly on the threat could needlessly antagonize Beijing, unsettle Taiwan’s population, and scare the international business community. This understandable caution sometimes came at the expense of military preparedness.

Another dent in Taiwan’s armor has been a split in public opinion. It has been governed by the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for more than a decade, but the opposition Kuomintang is more sympathetic to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Misled by aggressive CCP disinformation campaigns, a significant share of Taiwanese people believe that the DPP and their friends in Washington are primarily responsible for stoking tensions with China.

On past trips, these issues led my colleagues and I to sometimes wonder whether the United States cares more about Taiwan’s security than Taiwan does itself. Why should Americans die to defend Taiwan if the Taiwanese aren’t doing what it takes to ensure their own self-defense?

This, however, was not the takeaway from our most recent trip. There is a new energy in Taiwan—and a welcome and unprecedented seriousness about its self-defense.

The new approach starts at the top. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te has been more aggressive than his predecessor in calling attention to the China threat and taking measures to counter it. This includes, for example, declaring China a “hostile foreign force,” reinstating military tribunals to try retired military officers engaged in espionage for China, and deporting Chinese nationals who glorify the CCP’s plans to conquer Taiwan.

He has also appointed Taiwan’s first truly civilian defense minister, Wellington Koo, who is pushing through much-needed reforms. These include consolidating the policy to extend mandatory military service from four months to one year and holding unscripted military exercises.

Taiwan’s past defense strategies unrealistically envisioned stopping China’s military at the water’s edge. But under Koo, the Taiwanese military has adopted what he called an “erosion” defense strategy, designed to attrit China’s invading forces and fight for every inch of the island, buying time for outside (primarily U.S.) intervention. The strategy is supported by a boost in defense spending from 2 percent of GDP 6 years ago to around 2.5 percent in 2025; Lai has pledged to raise this figure to 3 percent.

Although some of Taiwan’s defense procurements, such as locally produced submarines, are still questionable, the resources are mostly being spent on precisely those asymmetric capabilities that will be needed to block a Chinese amphibious invasion of the island, including anti-ship missiles and air and missile defense. Indeed, U.S. officials report that Taiwan is now buying everything that American defense planners are asking them to buy.

In fact, as our Taiwanese counterparts frequently reminded us, the biggest obstacle to Taiwan’s defense buildup now is the sorry state of the U.S. defense industrial base and Washington’s inability to fill Taiwan’s large backlog of orders. We consoled our counterparts by pointing out that at least they are not alone in getting defense equipment behind schedule and over budget. Washington does that to everyone, including itself.

To supplement U.S. arms deliveries, Taiwan is prioritizing the development of its own next-generation weapons. To this end, Taiwanese Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim helped set up an office modeled after the U.S. Defense Department’s Defense Innovation Unit. On our latest trip, we visited companies like Geosat, a producer of sophisticated aerial drones, and Lungteh Shipbuilding, which builds unmanned kamikaze surface ships.

But it is not just armies or navies that go to war. How resilient is Taiwan’s society to a large-scale Chinese invasion or blockade? In the event of war, China would likely sever Taiwan’s connection to the outside world by cutting undersea cables and blocking maritime energy imports, which Taiwan depends on for more than 95 percent of its supply. In the face of these and other threats to life on the island, will the Taiwanese be willing to resist and fight back, like the Ukrainians did, or will they fold and simply accept their new Chinese communist overlords?

To address the societal challenge, Taiwan’s government has closely collaborated with the United States to develop a new whole-of-society defense resilience committee. Among other steps, Taiwan has set up a system of satellites to supply internet access even after undersea cables have been cut and is making major investments in locally produced energy, including offshore wind. Government ministries are conducting exercises to plan for the provision of essential services in a crisis. An aptly named All-Out Defense Mobilization Agency—all-out is always better than halfway when prepping for a war—has been established to organize, train, and equip a reserve force of more than 1.5 million, drawing from Taiwan’s large pool of former military conscripts.

Mass communication is contributing, as well. A new television miniseries will be released this summer that aims to bring the threat home to the average citizen: Zero Day, a graphic portrayal of a fictional Chinese attack on Taiwan. As older voters—who tend to be more sympathetic to Beijing—age out of the population, they are leaving behind younger cohorts with a stronger Taiwanese national identity, greater antipathy toward the CCP, and willingness to fight for Taiwan’s survival.

Taiwan’s new military preparedness is also backed by surging economic confidence. On the back of steady economic growth of 3 to 4 percent annually in recent years, its people are getting wealthier, with GDP per capita now higher than that of Japan.

This is all good progress, but there is more work to be done.

While Taiwan has been right to boost defense spending, the current level is still not enough. A top Trump administration defense official recently said that Taiwan should be spending 10 percent of GDP on defense, which is more than three times what it is spending now. That would be excessive, but NATO allies are on track to commit to a new defense spending pledge of 5 percent at their annual summit at The Hague next month, and this would also be a reasonable target for a country like Taiwan, which is every bit as exposed as NATO’s eastern front-line states; Lithuania, for example, plans to spend 5.25 percent next year.

The 1.5 million reservists might look impressive at first glance, but they are little more than names in a Defense Ministry database at this point. Taiwan needs to prioritize equipping these forces with rifles, ammunition, drone training, and other basics—as well as the logistics of deploying them—before throwing money at high-end capabilities like the F-35.

Taiwan’s move toward greater energy independence is real, but it is starting from a very low baseline. The island’s stockpiles of liquefied natural gas, for example, are legally required to last a minimum of only eight days in the event of a blockade. A major war would almost certainly last longer, forcing Taiwan to ration energy. The DPP government should reconsider its pledge to ban nuclear energy, extend the lifespan of current reactors, and consider deploying a new generation of small, modular reactors.

But none of this should take away from the impressive improvement in Taiwan’s self-defense. Turning Taiwan into a porcupine will be essential for staving off a Chinese attack.

In the future, the United States will be more likely to help those who help themselves. Even if Taiwan becomes a porcupine, global peace and stability will likely depend on continued U.S. support for the island. Ensuring that support—and thereby making the risk of war incalculable for China—may be the single most consequential reason why Taiwan’s new seriousness on defense should be so welcome.

Case in point: On May 23, just as U.S. and European trade negotiators are set to return to the table and sort out a raft of contentious issues, U.S. President Donald Trump did another about-face and threatened 50 percent tariffs on Europe starting next week if the world’s biggest economic bloc doesn’t yield to his dictates, which it hasn’t yet. He also threatened Apple with 25 percent tariffs on its iPhones if the company doesn’t move manufacturing of the product to the United States. Trump previously demanded that Apple shift production away from China, which it is now doing—but it’s moving that production to India, rather than Indiana.

At just about the halfway point of the Trump administration’s self-imposed 90-day sprint to reach trade agreements with more than half the countries on Earth, the progress is dire, and the prospects look even worse.

July 8 is the deadline that Trump set for negotiated trade concessions to avoid the arbitrary and sky-high tariffs that he announced in early April, the so-called “liberation day” tariffs that terrified markets and made him temporarily recalibrate. So far, only one has reached an agreement to pacify the Trump administration: the United Kingdom, which signed a small-scale, preemptive truce that will affect a handful of sectors such as fancy cars, jet engines, beef, and ethanol. The United States’ biggest and most important trade partners, including Canada, Mexico, China, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, are still trying to find a formula to mollify the administration.

“Trump administration officials have been touting the number and significance of the coming trade deals, but so far there is just one announced deal (with the U.K.), which has not even taken effect yet,” said Simon Lester, an international trade lawyer who has been especially diligent in tracking the administration’s progress and transparency on trade talks.

“Maybe they can go on a 4th-quarter run that gets them back in the game, but at halftime it seems like a new strategy might be in order,” he said.

Talks with the EU are exhibit A for the dysfunction, and not just because Trump’s latest tariff threat more than doubles the rate of import duties he threatened on Europe in April. So far, the EU has offered up a cocktail of tried-and-true measures to appease Trump, from buying more U.S. energy (Europe could use a little more U.S. natural gas, but not that much) to strategic cooperation in sectors such as semiconductors, steel, and autos. The latest olive branch was coupled with an offer for zero-for-zero tariffs, meaning that both economic blocs would lower their primary trade barriers.

The U.S. response to Europe’s overture was reportedly one-sided: Europe must slash its tariffs and disembowel its entire regulatory and safety structure, while U.S. tariffs stay in place. Given that the problem, in Trump’s eyes, is that Europe sells more stuff to the United States than it buys, Brussels must budge, but Washington won’t. The progress and prospect of those talks can be measured in Friday’s dramatic threat to put higher tariffs on Europe than those currently on China.

But it’s not just Europe. Deals with almost every other major trading partner are also stumbling down the staircase. India, under Trump-friendly Prime Minister Narendra Modi, may be the closest to the finish line, but hurdles remain. Trump said India offered to remove all tariffs, which India denied. But India has a three-phase plan to calm Trump first, to avoid the immediate threat, and then move to substantive issues.

Other big U.S. trading partners are less blessed with political overlap between Trump and their leaders and have less margin to appease him. Japan and South Korea, both critical U.S. security allies in the Asia-Pacific, are struggling with slowing economies, as their export-heavy economies linger under a tariff shadow. And yet both are reluctant to surrender. South Korea, which has an existing free-trade agreement with the United States, logically wants tariffs to be lifted. Japan, too, wants zero tariffs, though it has no such free-trade agreement. Both countries also have elections on the horizon.

Canada and Mexico, the United States’ two biggest trading partners, have not made any substantive progress in securing fresh trade deals, either.

They, along with everyone other than the U.K., are a reminder that some of Trump’s punitive tariffs remain in place, despite the 90-day truce: There are sectoral import duties on steel, aluminum, and cars—and perhaps soon on pharmaceuticals, copper, and lumber.

The markets took ill to Trump’s April foray into trade policy, sending stock returns down and bond yields up, before calming back down on the apparent belief that things would return to normal. The vigilantes, though, are back. Equity indices such as the S&P 500 are wavering between hope and despair, while bond markets build bunkers. The absolute gold standard, safe-haven investment—long-term U.S. Treasury bills—is offering fire sales to attract buyers.

That is a verdict more eloquent than any European or Japanese trade negotiator could ever give.

It was an embarrassing episode of disrespect to a foreign leader, perhaps second only to Trump and U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance’s fight in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And it occurred shortly after the Trump administration welcomed its first batch of global refugees: white South Africans. While Trump has shut the door to refugees as part of an across-the-board immigration crackdown, he has cynically and painfully made an exception for white Afrikaners, the group that ruled during South Africa’s apartheid era.

On Wednesday in the Oval Office, U.S. President Donald Trump received South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa. Their initially friendly banter quickly gave way as Trump levied false claims over a genocide of white South Africans, and in particular white farmers. He even cued a misleading video alleging to back up his claim and charged Ramaphosa and his team to watch it.

Vance’s fight in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And it occurred shortly after the Trump administration welcomed its first batch of global refugees: white South Africans. While Trump has shut the door to refugees as part of an across-the-board immigration crackdown, he has cynically and painfully made an exception for white Afrikaners, the group that ruled during South Africa’s apartheid era.

Relations between the United States and South Africa have been deteriorating since the moment Trump returned to the White House. The ostensible reason is an unfolding “white genocide” in South Africa, a false claim pushed by Trump and Elon Musk, who was born in the country. The narrative revolves around white farmers, whom Trump and Musk claim have been systematically targeted for murder and land expropriation because of their race. The claims concerning murder are simply false, with little factual basis at all. The allegations about land appropriation are also wrong, but for more complicated reasons.

At the end of apartheid and decades of forced removals of Blacks from their lands, whites made up only 11 percent of the country’s population but held 86 percent of its farmland. After 30 years of efforts to return land to dispossessed Blacks, that picture has only changed marginally. Notwithstanding some notable successes in land restitution, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party has been struggling to broadly open economic opportunity for Blacks on the land. Today, whites comprise around 7 percent of the population and own about 72 percent of farmland.

That glaring disparity has fueled vocal calls for the ANC to move faster on land returns. After years of debate, in January of this year Ramaphosa signed into law a new bill allowing the government to expropriate land without compensation for the purposes of ongoing land restitution to Blacks. Trump hit back with an executive order that cut off foreign aid to South Africa and that opened up a pathway for white Afrikaners to claim refugee status in the United States.

That law has yet to be exercised, and in practice its scope is quite circumscribed. Expropriations are also subject to judicial review, which is quite strong in South Africa.

Some groups and leaders within the country support a more radical approach to transferring land back to Blacks. Most notable is the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, Julius Malema, who advocates for the large-scale occupation of white-owned land.

Malema featured in the video Trump aired in the Oval Office purporting to show the persecution of Afrikaners. There, Malema was singing “Kill the Boer,” a controversial anti-apartheid song. Ramaphosa pointed out that the South African government does not endorse Malema and that South African citizens enjoy freedom of speech. That song in particular has been examined in the courts for whether it constitutes hate speech, but recent rulings indicate that it is protected speech that, due to its heritage in association with the anti-apartheid liberation movement, should not be taken literally. Trump charged Ramaphosa to arrest Malema during their meeting.

The rest of Trump’s video was a mish-mash of different clips, including an alleged large-scale burial site of murdered white farmers that turned out to be a memorial for a single instance. Trump also had a disorganized stack of loose-leaf paper printouts of alleged targets of violence that turned out to include at least one photo taken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

What was obviously absent was any concrete evidence of whites being systematically targeted with violence for their land ownership or race. That’s not to say that white farmers haven’t been killed in the country—some, lamentably, have been. But homicide rates in South Africa are generally high across the board. Compared to the U.S., where the homicide rate is around six per 100,000 people, the homicide rate in South Africa is 45 per 100,000.

Police statistics indicate that white South Africans are not killed at any higher rate than other South Africans. To the contrary, whites are less subject to violence, comprising less than 2 percent of murder victims. Of 26,232 murders recorded by police in the country in 2024, eight of the victims were farmers.

There are also no instances of uncompensated land seizures in South Africa, which Trump has talked up as a bogeyman, but which are intended to be used quite sparingly, and are subject to judicial review in a country with a strong rule of law. I have spent time in South Africa with land restitution communities and have talked with government officials and close observers. One of the chief complaints of the ANC’s record on land reform is that it has not done enough and not done reform well—rather than that it’s had some sort of scorched-earth policy of land seizures.

The ANC has not been a radical party as some feared during the transition from apartheid. Instead, it has hewn to Nelson Mandela’s legacy of moderation. For decades it has been criticized from both the right and left. It lost its majority for the first time in last year’s elections, and rather than ally itself with radical fringe parties, it reached across the aisle to connect with the party most closely associated with white South Africans and business: the Democratic Alliance.

The broadside against Ramaphosa in the Oval Office mainly served as a performative play to Trump’s base. It also signals to other foreign leaders that Trump will behave as he wants, and that truth is irrelevant. That will only serve to push countries that pride themselves on their independence further away from links to the United States.

A proposed thousand-mile fence along the mountainous India-Myanmar border threatens to disrupt the weekend parties—as well as trade, migration, historical and other cultural ties—all under the banner of security. The government of India, which has proceeded with its plans largely without the involvement of Myanmar’s central government, argues that the fence will curb smuggling, insurgency, and illegal migration issues, and mirrors a growing trend of fencing across the world, from the U.S.-Mexico border, to Europe, North Africa, and Southeast Asia. (Asia now has the largest share of border walls globally, at 56 perfect.) Since the end of the Cold War, the number of border walls and fences worldwide has sextupled , from just a dozen in the late 1980s to at least 74 today. In the European Union alone, the total length of border fences increased from 195 miles in 2014 to more than 1,200 miles by 2022. Six out of 10 people now live in a country that has built walls on its borders.

Along the Tiau River that divides Mizoram in India from Chin State in Myanmar, get-togethers by the water are a common weekend pastime. Since alcohol sales are banned in Mizoram, people from the Indian side travel across the dried-up riverbed, music blasting from their cars, to buy alcohol in Myanmar. Further north, in the village of Longwa in Nagaland, the border passes, literally, through the house of the village chief.

Six out of 10 people now live in a country that has built walls on its borders.

This surge has been driven by a mix of geopolitical tensions, rising nationalism, migration anxieties, and the securitization of borders in the post-9/11 era. A global industry has emerged in tandem, with billions of dollars flowing into surveillance technologies, construction contracts, and the pockets of private security firms. The global border security market is valued at $49.55 billion in 2025 and is projected to grow to $63.61 billion by 2029. India’s fencing initiative along the Myanmar border is part of a global infrastructure boom that reflects a wider shift toward physical deterrence and exclusion as dominant tools of border governance.

But do fences work? Research on smuggling and fencing across the globe, as well as on-ground accounts gathered from smugglers, security forces, and people living at the border of India and Myanmar indicate that, on the contrary, they likely shift criminal dynamics, destabilize border communities, and have far-reaching implications for regional trade relations.

According to the Indian government, the fence is part of a broader effort to enhance security, curb illegal activities, and improve infrastructure in the northeastern region—which will also reduce the movement of arms, drugs, and counterfeit goods between India and Myanmar. The conflict in Myanmar has led to the movement of people fleeing the violence into Mizoram, and with this movement, the smuggling economy at the Mizoram-Myanmar border is indeed thriving. At this one crossing alone in the last two years, data from Indian security forces shared with the author shows that over $277 million was seized in drugs—primarily heroin and methamphetamine. (And by their own account in interviews, Indian security forces are able to seize only about 5 percent of what passes through.) With the neighboring state of Manipur in northeast India in the throes of an ethnic conflict and with Myanmar embroiled in civil war, arms trafficking is on the uptick as well.

With this surge of contraband, drugs, and arms, it is easy to understand why many Indian security personnel, tired of patrolling this hilly, porous border, see fences as a welcome solution. The Indian paramilitary in the border areas between India and Myanmar, stretched thin by their primary duties as a counterinsurgency force, often view the responsibility of curbing smuggling as an additional burden. Many admitted, however, that the difficulty in stopping smuggling comes not simply from the porous border itself, but largely from corruption on the Indian state side that enables the trade.

Far from a state-versus-smugglers dynamic, there exists a complex and often symbiotic relationship between smugglers and various state actors at the India-Myanmar border. It is driven by demand for both licit and illicit goods by the many individuals who profit from facilitating their movement, with some even paying large sums for official postings that allow them to collect bribes. Fencing the border is unlikely to eliminate this corruption; it will instead shift who benefits from it and alter the landscape of who can afford to participate in these businesses.

Research on smuggling in other regions of the world highlights that it is frequently regulated by state actors, with varying degrees of formality and enforcement. In Southeast Asia, for instance, certain smuggling routes are tacitly sanctioned by local authorities, who may rely on informal arrangements with smugglers to supplement their income or maintain control over volatile regions. Similarly, in North Africa, states have often tolerated certain activities and drawn on various informal arrangements to effectively structure large smuggling economies in line with their wider interests. Their experiences suggest that border fortifications like fences may not simply disrupt smuggling networks but instead reconfigure them, potentially consolidating power among more organized and well-connected actors while marginalizing smaller, less-resourced participants.

Perhaps that is why in interviews, a well-established smuggler at the India-Myanmar border did not seem overly concerned on how the fence might affect his various large-scale operations. Another informant, a member of the Indian security forces overseeing operations in a border area said that, “for big smugglers who are making crores, no amount of deterrents like fences will work.”

For small-time informal traders, however, it will be a different matter. As one of them asserted, “For a small businessman, it is always better to have no fence.” As another local trader explained: “The local will always do their business informally.” Referring to the deep cultural and kinship bonds across the border region, he further described how, because of a fence, “socially, the bond will be broken … then, economically too.” The more optimistic among the traders expect the government to show a degree of pragmatism. “They understand that small traders will need to continue to survive,” said one border businessman, expressing how he expects a degree of ambiguity, negotiation, and understanding to continue despite any proposed fence.

As border infrastructure has proliferated across the globe in recent years, research in different countries and borders has highlighted that infrastructure like fences represent an increase in the cost of smuggling—either in the technological costs of moving goods across barriers or the costs of moving it through relationships with security forces. For more highly capitalized networks trading in arms or drugs, this is often more manageable, and perhaps an incentive to specialize or collaborate. For survivalist smugglers in border regions often trading in licit goods and foodstuff, fencing can represent an insurmountable hurdle.

People carry goods from Myanmar into India through Indo-Myanmar Friendship Gate.

However, there is strong academic evidence that fencing also reduces formal trade. Studies find, for example, that countries separated by a border wall are associated with a 31 percent reduction in trade between neighboring nations. The border fence at the India-Myanmar border is likely to significantly inhibit legal cross-border trade by heightening “border effects” and making formal trade more difficult.

Far from resolving the complex challenges of smuggling, insurgency, and migration, this physical barrier is likely to reconfigure and potentially further organize criminal smuggling networks to disempower small scale traders and to disrupt legitimate trade. By the river that divides these two countries, and amidst the car-parties that unite them, a local trader, armed with a glass of across-the-border Burmese alcohol, shared his concerns. “From the government of India perspective, it may sound great, but for those of us on the ground, it will create chaos.”

That vulnerability is now back in the conversation, not because of Chinese action, but because of a dramatic shift in Bangladesh’s foreign policy. In just a few months, India-Bangladesh ties have unraveled into mutual suspicion, strategic maneuvering, and a dangerous blame game. Since Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ouster last August, New Delhi has lost its privileged access in Dhaka, where the new leadership is openly courting Beijing and Islamabad.

In June 2017 , Indian and Chinese troops stared each other down on the windswept Doklam plateau in Bhutan, beginning a standoff that lasted for 73 days. The trigger was a Chinese road construction project that came perilously close to India’s vulnerable Siliguri Corridor—sandwiched between Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal—and brought home a chilling reality: The fate of India’s northeast could hinge on this sliver of land and the goodwill of its neighbors.

That vulnerability is now back in the conversation, not because of Chinese action, but because of a dramatic shift in Bangladesh’s foreign policy.

Since Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ouster last August, New Delhi has lost its privileged access in Dhaka, where the new leadership is openly courting Beijing and Islamabad.

As India struggles to shape the global narrative after its recent clash with Pakistan, having its eastern neighbor aligned with its two biggest adversaries—to the west and the north—is not welcome news.

India’s troubles with Bangladesh are not the result of a hostile axis between China and Pakistan, but because of its own missteps: most notably, New Delhi’s unwavering support for Hasina’s authoritarian regime and the rise of Hindu nationalism under Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. By prioritizing short-term security interests and domestic politics over democratic values and goodwill, India alienated the Bangladeshi public, squandered its influence in Dhaka, and pushed its neighbor to seek out new partners.

Meanwhile, Indian media is awash with alarmist rhetoric that frames Bangladesh’s pivot as a conspiracy orchestrated by China and Pakistan. The truth is that India’s predicament is largely self-inflicted, the result of years of strategic myopia. The diplomatic rupture threatens India’s security, economic interests, and regional standing—underscoring the urgent need for introspection and a reset in New Delhi’s approach to its neighborhood.

Few places illustrate India’s strategic vulnerability more starkly than the Siliguri Corridor, which is 22 kilometers wide at its narrowest point and connects India’s northeast to the rest of the country. The corridor is a lifeline to the Indian states bordering China and Myanmar.

Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh’s interim leader, did not mince words about the area during a visit to China in March, drawing outcry in New Delhi. He urged China to establish an economic foothold in Bangladesh by highlighting his country’s strategic position. “India’s northeast is completely landlocked, and its access to the ocean is completely controlled by Bangladesh. The Siliguri Corridor is the only route that connects the northeast with the rest of India, and this connection passes through Bangladesh,” Yunus said.

In China, Yunus showed a new willingness to leverage geography for diplomatic and economic advantage. This wasn’t just rhetoric: Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a plane to bring Yunus to Beijing, signaling close ties. China also granted 100 percent duty-free access to Bangladeshi exports and pledged to import more goods from Bangladesh. Yunus secured a commitment of $2.1 billion in Chinese funding, along with infrastructure and military cooperation agreements.

Eager to expand its influence in South Asia, China has long embraced Bangladesh as a partner, including during Hasina’s regime, when it built a submarine base in the coastal city of Pekua. These ties are reaching another level under Yunus, while India struggles to find its footing in Bangladesh without Hasina.

India’s nightmare scenario is clear: A hostile Bangladesh, aligned with China and Pakistan, could threaten to choke off the Siliguri Corridor, isolating the northeast and destabilizing the region.

This isn’t just theoretical. When Indian soldiers boldly walked into Bhutan in June 2017 to stop Chinese workers from building a road, it was to prevent Beijing from getting close to the Siliguri Corridor. Former Indian Army Gen. M.M. Naravane mentions concern at the highest political levels about Chinese access to the region in his memoir, Four Stars of Destiny. (The Indian government has not cleared the book for publication.)

China consolidated its military presence in the Doklam plateau after the two sides disengaged in August 2017. But it remained a point of concern even in 2020, when India and China were grappling with a major border crisis in Ladakh, some 1,500 miles away. According to Naravane, India has constantly pressed Bhutan about safeguarding the area. To hear Yunus openly talk about this strategic vulnerability on Chinese soil is bound to raise an alarm in India.

Meanwhile, Yunus has also agreed to invite China to further develop the Mongla port; under Hasina’s government, Bangladesh agreed to let India use and operate the port, with operational rights for an Indian company now in place. The Bangladeshi leader has also reportedly invited Pakistan to build an air base at Lalmonirhat, near the Siliguri Corridor.

Many people in both countries pinned hopes on Modi’s meeting with Yunus at a regional summit in Bangkok in April to reset India-Bangladesh relations, but the leaders talked past each other. The meeting highlighted major flash points, as Modi and Yunus raised their grievances and security concerns, underscoring the depth of tensions and the need for further dialogue.

Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam, posted on social media that when Yunus mentioned Bangladesh’s request for the extradition of Hasina—who has been staying in New Delhi since last year—Modi’s “response was not negative.” (Alam also said that Modi told Yunus, “We saw her [Hasina’s] disrespectful behavior towards you.”)

India, however, denied the claim and dismissed the account as politically motivated. Modi raised the issue of attacks against Hindus in Bangladesh after Hasina was deposed, and Indian officials said that the “Bangladeshi contention that attacks on minorities were a social media concoction was dismissed as being in contradiction of facts on the ground.”

For nearly two decades, India’s Bangladesh policy revolved only around Hasina. Her Awami League government delivered stability in India’s northeast, cracked down on insurgents targeting India, and granted New Delhi vital transit rights. Under Hasina, Bangladesh even gave favorable contracts to the Adani Group, a corporate ally of Modi.

In return, India provided unwavering diplomatic, political, and economic support to Hasina, even as her rule grew increasingly autocratic and unpopular. Elections in 2014, 2018, and 2024 were widely criticized as rigged. Yet India shielded Hasina from international pressure and ignored Bangladeshis’ growing resentment toward her government; it hardly engaged with other stakeholders during her tenure.

This Faustian bargain had consequences. To many Bangladeshis, India became complicit in undermining the country’s democratic aspirations. Anti-India sentiment festered, fueled by border killings, water-sharing disputes, and the perception that India benefited disproportionately from the relationship. When mass protests forced Hasina’s resignation, India found itself with few friends in Dhaka and little leverage.

Hindu nationalist politics under Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have compounded India’s woes. The 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act excluded Muslims from provisions for fast-tracked Indian citizenship for persecuted minorities from Bangladesh and other neighbors. Those in Bangladesh saw the law as an affront—an attempt to cast Bangladeshis as “illegal infiltrators” and “termites,” in the words of Indian Home Minister Amit Shah.

Modi’s visit to Bangladesh in 2021 sparked violent protests, and persistent anti-Bangladeshi rhetoric from BJP leaders has deepened the sense of betrayal.

To many Bangladeshis, India now appears less as a secular partner and more as a Hindu-majoritarian state, indifferent to the concerns of its Muslim neighbors. India has raised the issue of attacks against Hindus in Bangladesh since Hasina’s ouster, often based on misinformation. In a tit-for-tat response to such statements, Dhaka recently urged New Delhi “to take all steps to fully protect the minority Muslim population” after violence in the Indian state of West Bengal.

This shift has emboldened nationalist and Islamist forces in Dhaka, who see little incentive to accommodate Indian interests and every reason to seek new partners in Beijing and Islamabad.

Indian commentary often attributes Bangladesh’s new foreign-policy activism to manipulation by China and Pakistan. The reality is more complex. Under Yunus, Bangladesh is pursuing a classic hedging strategy: broadening its diplomatic options, extracting investment from China, and re-engaging with Pakistan after years of estrangement. In April, Bangladesh and Pakistan held their first foreign office consultations since 2010. Pakistan’s deputy prime minister was scheduled to visit Dhaka afterward; it was postponed after the terrorist attack in Kashmir.

Bangladesh resuming direct flights, easing visa restrictions, and engaging in nascent military cooperation with Pakistan signal a deliberate effort to reduce dependence on India and assert autonomy. Pakistan, meanwhile, sees a chance to regain influence in Bangladesh, which it lost in the country’s 1971 liberation war, with the added benefit of unsettling India’s eastern flank.

China, for its part, has seized the opportunity. It has offered Bangladesh duty-free access for exports, technology transfers, and billions of dollars in infrastructure funding with a clear goal to draw the country into the orbit of its Belt and Road Initiative and use its territory as strategic leverage against India. China offers Bangladesh a route to “escape India’s foreign policy grip” and an opportunity for the next stage of greater regional integration.

Alarmed by these developments, India has responded with a mix of threats, intimidation, and economic coercion. Its message to Beijing, Dhaka, and Islamabad is unambiguous: Any attempt to threaten the Siliguri Corridor will be met with overwhelming force. “India has one chicken neck and Bangladesh has two chicken necks. So, if they think of attacking our chicken neck, we will attack their two necks. Their chicken neck from Meghalaya to Chittagong port is smaller than our chicken neck. It’s just one call away,” Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

A retired Indian naval commander wrote that a narrow land bridge in southeastern Bangladesh is vulnerable to Indian military action; there is a 17-kilometer-wide area that opens into the Bay of Bengal and includes Chittagong harbor, which could be split off from the country. A former policy advisor to Modi’s government has even advocated new mapmaking to redress a “strategic vulnerability” like the Siliguri Corridor—threatening the very existence of Bangladesh.

On the economic front, India has suspended a key transshipment facility that allowed Bangladesh to route exports through Indian ports—widely interpreted as retaliation for Dhaka’s embrace of Beijing. The arrangement had streamlined trade, making it easier and cheaper for Bangladesh to access international markets. Terminating it will likely increase costs for Bangladesh’s strained export sector, especially its garment industry.

Over the weekend, India tightened the screws when it stopped Bangladeshi exports of ready-made garments and other specified goods through all land ports, allowing entry only via Kolkata and Mumbai with mandated inspections. The move came in response to Bangladesh’s earlier restrictions on Indian yarn exports via land ports; it significantly limits Bangladeshi access to the Indian market, affecting its garment industry and broader bilateral trade relations. Though India frames these steps as necessary for national security, they also risk deepening the rift.

Blaming Pakistan and China for the current tensions conveniently ignores India’s own role in alienating Bangladesh. By backing Hasina, ignoring democratic backsliding, and indulging in Islamophobic politics, India has squandered the goodwill that it built painstakingly over decades.

The strategic consequences are profound. Bangladesh’s pivot away from India threatens to undermine counterterrorism cooperation, which is vital for containing cross-border militancy and insurgency in India’s volatile northeast. Economic ties, once a source of mutual benefit, are fraying, with trade disruptions and rising protectionism on both sides. Most dangerously, the risk of border incidents or even insurgent resurgence in India’s northeast is growing.

To arrest this downward spiral, India must first look inward. At this critical juncture, the question is no longer whether geography makes India vulnerable, but whether its own choices have become a dangerous liability.

Rather than blaming external actors for Bangladesh exercising its autonomy, India must recommit to democratic values. Only then can New Delhi rebuild trust with the Bangladeshi people. The Modi government must work toward curbing Islamophobic rhetoric within its ranks. It can’t allow its Hindu-majoritarian domestic politics to dictate India’s foreign policy. The language of exclusion and suspicion must give way to respect and partnership.

The Modi government’s attempts to employ a punitive strategy have failed in South Asia, whether in Nepal, the Maldives, or Bangladesh. Rather than economic coercion, India should offer positive incentives: trade, investment, and connectivity projects that benefit both sides. It is high time that India recognizes that its neighbors have agency. Building coalitions, not dependencies, is the only sustainable path to regional stability.

The current situation is about more than the Siliguri Corridor or maritime access to the Bay of Bengal. It is a test of whether India can adapt to a multipolar South Asia, where smaller states want to reassert their sovereignty. If the Modi government fails to recalibrate, it risks not only the loss of Indian influence in Bangladesh, but also the unraveling of its entire Neighborhood First and Act East policies.

The lesson is clear: Strategic depth cannot be bought with autocratic bargains or defended with force alone. It must be earned through respect, restraint, and a willingness to see neighbors as equals.

Munir’s Moment in the Sun

A Gallup Pakistan poll released on May 21 found that 93 percent of Pakistanis said that their view of their military improved after the country’s recent conflict with India. Meanwhile, 97 percent deemed the military’s performance to be “very good” or “good”—positive news for Pakistani Army chief Asim Munir.

After the May 10 cease-fire that ended the latest violence, Pakistanis took to the streets to celebrate, shouting pro-military slogans. The crowds included members and supporters of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which has been locked in a confrontation with the military since the 2023 arrest of party leader and former Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Khan, in comments posted on his X account, even called on the nation to embrace the military, which has benefited from the rally-around-the-flag effect.

However, this outpouring of support may also seem odd, given what happened during the crisis: Pakistan was hit hard, as India deployed missiles and drones deep into Pakistani territory. New Delhi’s initial strikes targeted multiple terrorist sites, and subsequent attacks struck sensitive facilities in major cities—including an airbase in Rawalpindi, home to Pakistan’s military headquarters.

It was the most force that India has unleashed on Pakistan—in terms of intensity and range of locations—since a war between the two countries in 1971. But what others might see as humiliation Pakistanis view as a victimization and a victory—both of which bolster its powerful military.

Pakistani officials have pushed the narrative that Pakistan was punished—with brutal force, including assaults that killed innocent civilians—for something that it didn’t do. India has blamed Pakistan for an April 22 terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, using that alleged complicity as justification for its strikes in Pakistan. Islamabad denies any involvement in the Kashmir attack.

Pakistan retaliated with its own strikes in India; it claims that it shot down several Indian fighter jets. New Delhi neither confirmed nor denied this report, but it was confirmed by Western officials. Pakistanis regard their tough response as a major triumph. More broadly, the crisis validated the Pakistani military’s self-professed role as the prime protector against an ever-present Indian threat.

Moreover, Pakistan’s military scored geopolitical wins: U.S. President Donald Trump called for a solution to the Kashmir dispute, effectively internationalizing the issue—an outcome long sought by the Pakistani Army. The rapid intensification of hostilities also shifted the international community’s attention to nuclear escalation risks and away from India’s concern about Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.

This all stands in sharp contrast to recent years, when massive military clampdowns against the PTI and Khan—Pakistan’s most popular politician—spawned some of the sharpest anti-military sentiment in Pakistan in decades. Two years ago, Pakistani protesters attacked military facilities in a few cities after Khan was arrested.

Economic stress and surging terrorist attacks in Pakistan, coupled with anger about repression and exploitative investments in the provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, have put further pressure on the military. Social media campaigns, including those waged from abroad, have amplified anger at the institution and especially at Munir.

Munir has now emerged as one of the biggest winners of the latest India-Pakistan conflict, and he has opportunities to leverage his regained goodwill: He could pursue reconciliation with the political opposition, seek public buy-in for an expensive counterterrorism operation, or push for politically risky but essential economic reforms.

However, the uncompromising Munir—emboldened by the military’s change of fortune—will likely take it as carte blanche to double down on the repressive policies that have generated hostility, especially in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where post-crisis support for the military has been more muted.

On May 20, Pakistan announced Munir’s promotion to field marshal—an honor conferred only once before in 1959, on military dictator Ayub Khan. This development will galvanize Munir’s critics, who will see it as a case of a strongman exploiting a crisis to bolster his power. Munir’s clout has been fortified, but his political gains could be fleeting.

What We’re Following

India-Pakistan narrative battle. In the wake of their latest conflict, India and Pakistan have each announced that a group of prominent individuals, mainly senior politicians and former top diplomats, will travel the world in the coming days to get international buy-in for their governments’ positions on the crisis.

India’s delegation—led by Shashi Tharoor, an opposition figure and prominent thought leader—will emphasize Pakistan’s cross-border terrorism. Pakistan’s team—led by former Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari—will focus attention on Indian aggression and Pakistan’s position of peace. Tharoor and Bhutto, along with others in their delegations, have extensive global links, especially to the West.

Each government has a strong incentive to take its respective case abroad. India, which generally prefers that the world not get involved in its bilateral disputes, is concerned that the escalation has distracted attention from Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Meanwhile, Pakistan aims to use the opportunity to emphasize the importance of resolving the Kashmir dispute.

Historically, India’s advocacy has tended to get more traction on the global stage—in part because it enjoys more global influence than Pakistan, as a rising power with a fast-growing economy. India’s concerns about terrorism have also long resonated in many key global capitals.

U.S.-India trade talks. Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal visited Washington recently for the latest round of U.S.-India trade talks; Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to pursue a comprehensive trade deal in February. New Delhi hopes to work out a deal before a 90-day pause on Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs ends in July. (Trump initially imposed a 26 percent tariff on India.)

The trade talks have seemingly gone well so far, and Trump and other top U.S. officials have recently said that a deal is close. However, the India-Pakistan crisis has raised questions about the status of the negotiations. Trump claims that he used trade as a pressure tactic to get India and Pakistan to stop fighting; New Delhi rejects the assertion.

Other recent comments by Trump—including his public pitch to resolve the Kashmir issue—haven’t gone over well with India. Still, it’s unlikely that the trade talks will be affected, as the Trump administration wants them to succeed. And India, fearing a tariff snapback, needs them to succeed.

Bloomberg reported this week that the talks are indeed on track, with the two sides aiming to conclude an initial phase of the deal in July and a broader second phase accord expected sometime this fall.

India reduces imports from Bangladesh. India announced this week that it will restrict imports of Bangladeshi readymade garments and other products that arrive in India via northeastern trade routes, from processed foods to furniture. Indian reports suggest that the move is retaliation for Bangladeshi leader Muhammad Yunus’s comments during a recent visit to China about India’s landlocked northeastern states.

India took offense to Yunus’s statement, viewing it as an attempt to minimize the significance of the northeast—a region as volatile as it is strategic—and to diminish Indian connectivity projects that aim to facilitate greater access to northeastern states.

New Delhi’s move could be costly for Dhaka. Readymade garments are Bangladesh’s most important export. Transport costs could rise significantly by having to reroute the goods, mainly via seaports. Still, Bangladesh is now increasing trade with Pakistan, which could help limit the damage—though its trade volume with Pakistan is much lower than that with India.

This week, Reliance Power—part of the large Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries—announced a new venture with the investment arm of Bhutan’s government to jointly develop what is described as Bhutan’s largest solar power project. The facility is expected to have an installed capacity of 500 megawatts and will reportedly be completed in two years.

Reliance Power is led by Anil Ambani, the younger brother of Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries. Mukesh Ambani is not as closely linked to Modi as another prominent Indian billionaire, Gautam Adani, but he has recently gone out of his way to praise the premier.

There is reason to believe that Mukesh Ambani wants to align Reliance’s business objectives with Modi’s policy priorities. In that regard, the Bhutan investment makes a lot of sense: India is looking to expand commercial cooperation with the country, a close partner and one of the only countries in the region not currently experiencing any tensions with New Delhi.

In Himal Southasian, journalist Meghna Rao examines what Banu Mushtaq, who won the International Booker Prize this week, represents for Kannada-language literature. “Mushtaq was radical not just in what she wrote about … but also in how she wrote it,” Rao writes. “Hers was a direct, confrontational writing, rather than one reliant on allegory and myth, in a rejection of the otherwise Sanskritised literary forms then predominant in Kannada.”

In the Print, scholar Sana Hashmi writes about how online Chinese discourse is using hydropower to position China as Pakistan’s savior against India. “For Beijing, water diplomacy serves both to bolster Pakistan’s defences against Indian influence and to safeguard its investments and interests in the CPEC,” Hashmi says. “For India, the prospect of a two-front challenge has rarely felt more concrete.”

In the Daily Star, journalist Mohammad Al-Masum Molla reflects on the violent turn that Bangladesh’s street protests have taken. “What was once a means of voicing collective grievances has turned into a spectacle that is chaotic, disruptive, and at times alarmingly close to being anarchist,” he writes. “This shift reflects a deeper crisis: the breakdown of institutional governance.”

Zain and Urwa sheltered with their parents, Rameez Khan, 43, and his wife, Urusa Khan, 33, at their house in Poonch, a district in Indian-administered Kashmir near the Line of Control, the de facto border that divides the disputed region between India and Pakistan.

POONCH, Jammu and Kashmir—In the early hours of May 7, 12-year-old twins Zain Ali and Urwa Fatima cowered in their family home as the walls around them shook amid heavy shelling. The Pakistan Army had unleashed an intense round of artillery fire nearby, hours after Indian warplanes struck nine locations across the border.

POONCH, Jammu and Kashmir—In the early hours of May 7, 12-year-old twins Zain Ali and Urwa Fatima cowered in their family home as the walls around them shook amid heavy shelling. The Pakistan Army had unleashed an intense round of artillery fire nearby, hours after Indian warplanes struck nine locations across the border.

Zain and Urwa sheltered with their parents, Rameez Khan, 43, and his wife, Urusa Khan, 33, at their house in Poonch, a district in Indian-administered Kashmir near the Line of Control, the de facto border that divides the disputed region between India and Pakistan.

The family moved to Poonch, where the twins had started attending school, just two months ago. The city is around 5 miles from their native village of Chandak, and the parents decided to move closer to the new school to avoid daily bus commutes—and for their children’s safety. The twins had recently celebrated their 12th birthday in a rented two-story concrete house in a narrow alley just a few yards away from the school.

A man, a boy, a girl, and a woman sit for a family photo on a bed. The woman smiles and holds the girl's chin as she smiles.

When a shell hit their neighbor’s house on May 7, the twins called their maternal uncle, Adil Pathan, pleading with him to take them to safety. Pathan left Surankote, 17 miles away, and parked his car outside the alley a few hours later. Urusa held her daughter’s hand and Rameez held his son’s as the parents locked the door to their house.

Pathan was watching his family walk toward him when another shell struck behind them and filled the alley with smoke, splinters, and dust.

“I ran towards them and first found Urwa lying in blood, her legs twitching and shaking, before she died within seconds,” Pathan said. “I picked up Urwa and put her in the car. My sister went looking for Zain and found him in a neighbor’s courtyard after being hit in the abdomen.”

After the blast, Zain had stepped inside the courtyard and collapsed. A neighbor tried to revive him with CPR, but it was too late. Both children were rushed to the hospital in Poonch. After half an hour, Urusa realized her husband was missing.

“Please go back and look for him,” she told her brother. Pathan drove back to the house and found Rameez lying unconscious, surrounded by blood. By the time he was brought to the hospital, the doctors had declared the twins dead.

Since 1947, India and Pakistan have both claimed the region of Kashmir; over the years, the nuclear-armed neighbors have fought three major wars and experienced multiple clashes. The latest escalation erupted after militants killed 26 civilians in the Pahalgam valley in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22. India accuses Pakistan of supporting the militants who carried out the attack, but Islamabad has denied involvement.

In response to the Pahalgam attack, India launched what it called Operation Sindoor on May 7, conducting airstrikes in Pakistan that New Delhi said targeted “terrorist camps” used to train fighters and plan attacks in Kashmir. Pakistan responded with missile strikes, followed by drone attacks and artillery shelling along the border that struck in Kashmir and beyond, including in the states of Punjab, Rajasthan, and Gujarat.

The latest conflict was the most intense military flare-up between India and Pakistan since February 2019, when India conducted a bombing raid on militant bases in Balakot, Pakistan, following an attack on an Indian police convoy in Pulwama in Indian-administered Kashmir. Amid the India-Pakistan conflict, it is still Kashmir that bears the brunt of bullets, bombs, shells, and now drones. Violence has punctuated the contested region’s history: Since 2019, at least 277 soldiers and 212 civilians have died in 730 reported incidents in Kashmir.

A few months after the 2019 attack, the Indian government revoked Article 370, which had guaranteed Kashmir’s special autonomous status, and launched a crackdown on militancy in the region. At the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government implemented strict policies to suppress political dissent, targeting local political groups, journalists, and civil society leaders.

Sumantra Bose, an Indian political scientist and the author of Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a 21st-Century Conflict, said that after 2019, the quiet Kashmir valley resembled that of a graveyard, not a peaceful society. “Following the abrogation of Article 370, the repression was so suffocating that any semblance of political dissent or resistance was crushed,” he said, warning that since the “illusion of peace has shattered, what lies ahead could be far more destabilizing.”

In the latest clash, the Indian border districts of Uri, Rajouri, Poonch, and Akhnoor saw the human cost of mounting tensions. As I traveled across the region this month, villages and towns emptied as people migrated away from the border areas to safer locations. Those who stayed behind said they felt trapped: Many residents who spoke to Foreign Policy said they were caught in a battle between two nuclear-armed powers.

For Urusa, one shell was enough to destroy her life. At a government medical college in Jammu, 142 miles from home, she was barely able to talk as she sat on a bench wearing a floral shalwar kameez, face mask, and disposable polythene foot covers. Since her husband was brought to the hospital with shrapnel in his liver, ribs, and legs, Urusa had spent her days and nights in the intensive care unit.

“I went to our ancestral village first, buried my children, and came to the hospital to be with my husband,” Urusa said. From Poonch, Rameez was first shifted to Rajouri and then to Jammu. He still didn’t know that his children had been killed.

“He shouldn’t feel that something is wrong. I have to act normal in front of him and not mourn my children. I won’t tell him till he comes out of the hospital,” Urusa said. After regaining consciousness, when Rameez asked about his children, he was told that they were with their grandparents. “Don’t tell them about me—they will get worried,” he told his wife.

In the four days of intense border violence during the latest round of conflict, Poonch witnessed the most casualties and damage. The shelling in India’s border regions killed at least 21 civilians, injured dozens more, and damaged several houses and shops.

Among those killed was 45-year-old Nargis Begum, a cook in a government school in Uri. On May 8, Pakistani drones attacked areas along the border, including the cities of Jammu and Srinagar, but were mostly shot down by India’s air defense system. Panic gripped the area, and Begum decided to flee her village along with her children, but it was too late. As the family was in the car, an artillery shell exploded on the road ahead, injuring Begum and her sister-in-law.

A man in a baseball cap stands in a doorway of a home with a sorrowful face as a woman in an patterned head scarf touches his face. Another woman is in the doorway and another man is at far left.

The next day, when I arrived in the village, Begum’s body was being taken to the graveyard for funeral prayers. Her husband, Mohammad Bashir Khan, 58—an employee of the Indian Army’s Project Beacon, which focuses on building and maintaining road networks in Kashmir’s border districts—was sitting in a truck next to the coffin. More than two dozen men walked down a steep hill with Khan to bury his wife amid heavy rain.

“I had told my wife she should move out along with the children as shelling had intensified,” Khan said after the burial. “They left home around 9 p.m. in my brother’s car, and only a mile ahead on the road toward Baramulla town, a shell exploded.” Shrapnel pierced the rear of the car, hitting Begum in the face and neck. Khan’s sister-in-law was also hit; she is being treated at a hospital in Baramulla.

Though U.S. President Donald Trump announced a cease-fire between India and Pakistan on May 10—allowing both countries to claim victory—in villages along the border, debris remains to mark the tragic reminder of the deadly clash.

The cease-fire won’t end decades of hostility, instead bringing only a momentary calm. “Governments fight each other, but it is civilians who are suffering,” said Haji Muzaffar Khan, Begum’s brother-in-law. “Bombs don’t ask you before they hit. Poor people at borders get stuck. When a person is killed, nobody cares. It is a never-healing wound.”

More than 60 civilians died in India’s and Pakistan’s border regions in the latest clash, and many more were forced to evacuate their homes and leave everything behind. “We don’t want to die. There is no bunker or shelter. We left everything at home,” said 48-year-old Nayeer Begum, who was taking her three daughters far away from her native village, near Uri. “The government should have planned where people will go during shelling,” she said.

Most Kashmiris who live near the border have now started to return to their homes, but the trauma of the latest clash will remain etched in their memory. Bose said the cease-fire will serve not as a foundation for peace but as an interlude before the next confrontation.

“Indeed, Modi has described it as a ‘pause,’ and his administration has quietly revised its security doctrine. Now, any major terrorist incident will invite immediate military retaliation from India,” Bose said. Meanwhile, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif described the U.S.-brokered cease-fire as a “new beginning in the resolution of issues that have plagued the region and prevented its journey toward peace, prosperity, and stability.”

Kashmir remains caught in the middle of these opposing views. Pakistan isn’t willing to stop fighting over the region, and India isn’t ready to accept it as a disputed territory.

As the dust settles for now, there is a fragile calm in the region. The borders have fallen silent, and villagers are making their way back home. The wounded are being treated in hospitals. India and Pakistan are celebrating their respective military gains. But the families of those killed must bear the human cost.

This raises an interesting question over who actually wants to borrow these quantities in yuan: a barely convertible currency that—unlike the euro—has largely failed to capitalize on the dollar’s slide these past few months.

Earlier this month, China pledged $9.2 billion of credit to Latin American leaders gathered in Beijing. But there’s a twist: It wants to lend all this money in Chinese yuan, instead of the usual U.S. dollar credits that China has announced at previous gatherings of this regional forum.

Earlier this month, China pledged $9.2 billion of credit to Latin American leaders gathered in Beijing. But there’s a twist: It wants to lend all this money in Chinese yuan, instead of the usual U.S. dollar credits that China has announced at previous gatherings of this regional forum.

This raises an interesting question over who actually wants to borrow these quantities in yuan: a barely convertible currency that—unlike the euro—has largely failed to capitalize on the dollar’s slide these past few months.

Indeed, one might have expected China to be better positioned to capitalize on this very moment. China has sought to internationalize its currency for at least the past 15 years and has built the infrastructure to prove it. Initiatives include China’s “Cross-Border Interbank Payment System” (CIPS) to rival SWIFT, the multilateral mBridge for central bank digital currency transactions, and the building of yuan clearing centers around the world. But what it ultimately cannot control is who buys or uses the yuan.

In this vein, China has tried to incentivize uptake through lending. New research at the Federal Reserve Board finds that China has actually increased its proportions of yuan-denominated overseas loans from around 15 percent in 2021 to almost 40 percent in 2024, albeit mostly focused on Asia. It’s therefore not inconceivable that China will find borrowers for its currency in Latin America, too.

However, this reliance on debt to advance the yuan can only go so far. Several countries in Latin America are already at risk of debt default for the first time in decades, and their appetite for Chinese loans to buy more Chinese goods and services is no doubt limited. As the World Bank’s 2024 International Debt Report made clear, global south economies no longer face a liquidity crisis like they did in previous generations—they have proved very capable of borrowing on bond markets and from commercial banks. In other words, they have options, so the Chinese yuan needs to be appealing.

China’s capital controls are its biggest impediment in this regard. China may be wary to liberalize its capital account for fear of suffering a similar fate to Japan in the 1980s or South Korea in the 1990s. But simultaneously, China hopes it can convince the world to use more yuan by guaranteeing the stability of its value—a difficult task in the present trade war with the U.S. and ironically one that depends on Beijing holding USD as a backstop.

Furthermore, China is currently facing pressure to lend money to stimulate overseas demand for its exports, and the data on yuan holdings beyond loans would suggest that most countries still prefer to hold several other currencies before the yuan.

Even China’s biggest fans have only modestly incorporated yuan reserves into their central banks over the past few years. The great exception is Russia, which has been forced to inhale masses of yuan in exchange for the oil and gas it struggles to sell elsewhere due to sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. China effectively has Moscow over a barrel to take yuan, and yet, Russia cannot convert those yuan into U.S. dollars fast enough in Hong Kong.

The reality is that most of the world’s export invoices, debt issuances, and foreign exchange reserves are still in U.S. dollars, and until Chinese capital controls are significantly relaxed nobody wants to be too exposed to the yuan for fear of its lack of convertibility. Furthermore, world markets have often gravitated toward a hegemonic currency throughout history for the ease of doing business, whether they like the hegemon or not.

So, for now, the bigger question may actually be how many U.S. dollars will China be deploying toward Latin American trade before the next conference with Latin American leaders in three years? Quite possibly a lot more than the $9.2 billion in yuan, whether it comes in the form of buyer’s credits to the region’s governments, or seller’s credits that are issued directly to China’s exporters to cover costs before they receive their dollar payments.

Lastly, but certainly not least, China is not the only country that has tried to displace U.S. dollar hegemony. The French have been railing against the United States’ “exorbitant privilege” of having the world’s reserve currency since at least when Valéry Giscard d’Estaing was finance minister in the late 1960s and 1970s. Since they began those efforts to democratize central bank holdings of reserve currencies more than 50 years ago, they have made very little progress.

In fact, one hope for the euro was that it would catalyze France’s erstwhile modest gains. Once again, though, the French, among others who wished to see less USD dominance, have been largely disappointed. The euro has risen from around 18 percent of global reserves when it was launched to roughly 20 percent in 2025. Similarly, China’s gains of nothing in 2000 to 2 percent in 2025 are also pretty modest, having briefly overtaken the Canadian dollar in 2018 only to fall behind it again in 2023.

The upshot is that China is likely to keep driving the yuan in every arena it can, and borrowers like the Latin American leaders in Beijing last week may be its best opportunity in the short term. But this approach has its limits, and catching up with the euro, let alone the U.S. dollar, can only happen with a shift in demand. Without that, China may quickly find itself pushing rope.

Only about a couple of dozen factories in China are responsible for producing two-thirds of the world’s HCFC-22. So climate advocates rejoiced when Beijing signed onto the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol in 2021, which required all signatories to immediately stop emitting HFC-23 using widely available emissions destruction technology. Past efforts to cut the climate super pollutant in China had failed ; but the binding international agreement carried more heft and promise.

The nonstick pan has become one of climate change’s stickiest problems in recent years. Teflon, the magical chemical that has allowed fried eggs to glide off the pan onto breakfast plates for decades, is derived from the chemical HCFC-22. But HCFC-22 has an unfortunate side effect: Its production also generates HFC-23, a greenhouse gas that is 14,700 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in heating the planet.

Past efforts to cut the climate super pollutant in China had failed; but the binding international agreement carried more heft and promise.

The reports that China is required under Kigali to submit to the United Nations Environment Program appear to show that it has been working, with China’s HFC-23 emissions reported at relatively low levels in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available.

However, the atmosphere tells a different story.

In a recent study published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, scientists used data from remote monitoring stations around the globe and found that as of 2023, global HFC-23 emissions were five times higher than countries had reported to the U.N. in recent years. And the study attributes 40 percent of global emissions to eastern China.

The fact that HFC-23 emissions from China and other countries continue to reach the atmosphere in large volumes poses a test to the Kigali Amendment, which has been ratified by more than 160 countries since 2016. And it comes at a vulnerable moment for international climate action writ large, with U.S. President Donald Trump once again withdrawing the United States from global efforts.

HFC-23 may be little known compared to carbon dioxide, but the pollution is significant—global HFC-23 emissions in 2023 were equal to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of 48 million automobiles or 55 coal-fired power plants. “There is a powerful greenhouse gas that countries are, for whatever reason, not destroying, even though they should and have the means to, and that’s quite concerning,” said Ben Adam, a researcher in the School of Chemistry at the University of Bristol and the study’s lead author.

Where exactly China’s HFC-23 emissions are coming from isn’t entirely clear yet, but scientists have some hypotheses.

The production of a variety of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) is known to generate HFC-23, but scientists have assessed HCFC-22 to be the main culprit.

Over two decades before joining Kigali, the Chinese government attempted to address that problem without much success. During a U.N. program in the 2000s and an additional Chinese subsidy program from 2015 to 2019, HCFC-22 producers in the country installed equipment to destroy HFC-23. According to the Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment, 17 out of the 19 active HCFC-22 producers had installed incinerators as of 2021.

Incinerators installed and properly operated at the chemical plants can destroy 99.9 percent of waste HFC-23 at little cost. But perverse incentives and loopholes in the policies, previously documented in an investigation by Inside Climate News, allowed total emissions to continue rising to their high point in 2019 even as some of the HCFC-22 companies abated their emissions.

In signing onto the Kigali Amendment, Beijing took steps to reverse that trend. In September 2021, after Kigali went into force in China, the environment ministry issued a notice requiring all HCFC-22 and HFC producers to fulfill the international agreement’s requirement to eliminate emissions to the extent possible.

Joining the agreement seems to have made some difference. By 2023, the last year of data included in the study, HFC-23 emissions in eastern China had dropped by a third from the high point in 2018. Emissions did tick up slightly from 2021 to 2023, but they stayed well below their 2018 peak, even as China’s production of HCFC-22 continued rising.



However, Chinese regulations haven’t been strong enough to eliminate the problem. In 2021, the environment ministry didn’t establish any specific emissions standard or penalties for noncompliance. In January 2024, the ministry followed up with draft rules laying out how companies should measure and report their emissions. That guidance set a standard of destroying 99.99 percent of HFC-23 emissions.

But after more than a year, the rules have yet to be put into effect. In April, the ministry published a new national plan on the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, including enhanced measurement, reporting, and monitoring of HFC-23 emissions from HCFC-22 plants, but again the plan did not include any details on enforcement.

The Ministry of Ecology and Environment did not respond to requests for comment.

Hu Jianxin, a professor of environmental science and engineering at China’s Peking University who has conducted research on the super pollutant for years and contributed to the January 2024 draft rules, said HFC-23 “is one of the most priority issues” for the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. “They really care about this issue, and also a lot of people are actually working on auditing.”

He added that he was not sure why the rules haven’t been implemented but pointed to pushback from the affected plants. “The companies still complain,” he said.

Not counting initial capital costs, which many plants recouped through the subsidy programs, Chinese chemical plants can destroy HFC-23 at a cost of approximately $0.30 to $0.60 per tonne of CO2 equivalent. That makes destroying HFC-23 one of the most cost-effective ways to combat climate change.

Costs for capturing CO2, by comparison, range from $15 to $342 per tonne, with additional costs for storage, according to the International Energy Agency.

But without subsidies or another way to profit from the emissions abatement, it is still an extra cost for companies. Hu pointed to a plant in China that has captured HFC-23 and converted it back into HCFC-22 as a potential model for other companies to reap economic benefits from cutting pollution.

The blurry silhouettes of two figures are seen in front of a smokestack with a plume of smoke coming out of it.

The latest atmospheric readings pointing to continued emissions from China have not gone unnoticed by the Montreal Protocol. Emissions estimates in the 2024 study are similar to those published by the Montreal Protocol’s own Scientific Assessment Panel in September.

“The science is pretty clear,” said David Fahey, director of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s chemical sciences laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, and a co-chair of the Scientific Assessment Panel for the Montreal Protocol. “We kind of put it on the table for the [countries’] delegates to decide: Is this important enough to do something about?”

Whether they take action may hinge on the meaning of four words.

Under the Kigali Amendment, countries agree to curb HFC-23 emissions from HCFC-22 and other HFC production “to the extent practicable.” That phrase leaves significant room for interpretation.

“The term ‘to the extent practicable’ is not defined in the Protocol or in decisions by the parties, nor are there specific targets/schedules set for reduction in HFC-23 emissions to be achieved,” Megumi Seki, the executive secretary of the U.N.’s Ozone Secretariat, which oversees the Montreal Protocol, said in an email. “As long as the parties report some amounts destroyed per facility, we would understand that the party destroyed its HFC-23 emissions to the extent practicable.”

Climate advocates disagree.

“‘Practicable’ does not mean whether it was costly or not,” Avipsa Mahapatra, climate campaign director for Environmental Investigation Agency U.S., a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C., said. “It means whether it was technologically feasible.”

Stephen Andersen, director of research at the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (IGSD), a Washington, D.C.-based environmental nonprofit, said the insertion of the “extent practicable” language was an unfortunate part of the “horse trading” that goes into any multilateral agreement. Andersen attended the Montreal Protocol 2016 meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, when the amendment was first adopted.

However, he added, the agreement now needs to be re-energized to reduce climate pollution.

“Someone has to pressure the Montreal Protocol to do what they need to do before it gets worse,” he said.

Seki said that the amount of HFC-23 that countries report as destroyed is “taken at the face value” and that there are currently no cases of noncompliance under investigation.

But Mahapatra said the current study suggests that this approach isn’t working. “The parties and the protocol urgently need to move beyond this hand-waving self-reporting that we have seen so far, and really look into their real numbers,” Mahapatra said.

The HFC-23 issue was high on the agenda at a Montreal Protocol meeting last fall, but the talks only led to limited action.

At the meeting, a representative from the United States, speaking on the behalf of the United States and Canada, called for member countries with substantial differences between reported emissions and atmospheric measurements to reduce their emissions. As of 2023, U.S. chemical plants’ HFC-23 emissions were compliant with the Environmental Protection Agency’s Kigali Amendment regulations, according to the agency. But China pushed back, saying more research and greater technical capacity were needed, and that China shouldn’t be singled out for a global problem.

A formal decision, which was reached on a consensus basis among member countries, called for the voluntary sharing of atmospheric monitoring data. It also invited member countries with HCFC-22 plants to report how they calculate HFC-23 emissions and share information on best practices to reduce emissions. In short, the group did not agree to any actions that would force countries to address the glaring emissions problem, and the Kigali Amendment itself does not contain any penalties for failing to reduce HFC-23.

In the coming years, the United States may not be a voice in the room pushing for more accountability. Trump has led a broad effort to pull the United States out of international institutions and environmental pacts, and it remains unclear what role the United States will play in the Kigali Amendment going forward. The U.S. State Department did not answer questions about the country’s involvement in the Montreal Protocol’s next annual meeting scheduled for this fall.

Smokestacks of a factory are seen obscured by a cloud of pollution.

HCFC-22 plants are an obvious focus for reducing emissions because they are an established source of HFC-23 and are widely considered to be the main contributor. Yet even if the Montreal Protocol did step up scrutiny of HCFC-22 producers and China tightened its own oversight, the HFC-23 problem wouldn’t fully disappear. Scientists have found that other chemical plants also release HFC-23 emissions, and they’re debating the extent to which those other plants are contributing to the problem.

HFC-23 is known to be produced or leaked from a wide range of other HFC plants and through the use of HFC-23 to manufacture semiconductors as well as other products. In recent years, Peking University’s Hu and his colleagues have also measured small amounts of HFC-23 at various fluoride chemical plants in China. They are still far from knowing the proportion of HFC-23 coming from each non-HCFC-22 source, but he estimates that the total may be significant given the scale of China’s fluorochemical industry.

“If there are too many of these kinds of small chemical substances, in aggregate it is still a big figure,” Hu said.

The transformation of HCFC-22 into Teflon is one major concern for scientists. That process can release additional HFC-23 emissions beyond the original production of HCFC-22. Another recent study, based on local air monitoring in southern China, found that this process “could be emerging as an increasingly significant emission source of HFC‐23” and merits further attention since those plants fall outside of the Kigali Amendment’s reporting requirements.

“It is probably the most important of the remaining sources, but it is nowhere near as important [as HCFC-22 production],” Adam said.

There’s also always the possibility of illegal production of HCFC-22 as a refrigerant, which would not be subject to monitoring. HCFC-22 was once commonly used for refrigeration and air conditioning, but China is phasing out its use in those industries under the Montreal Protocol, as the chemical depletes the Earth’s ozone layer, which protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.

The phasing out of the refrigerant could have had the unintended consequence of causing illegal production at chemical plants that would be unlikely to incinerate their HFC-23 waste gas, Clare Perry, a climate campaign leader at the Environmental Investigation Agency U.K., a nonprofit based in London, said. A limited number of cases of illegal HCFC-22 production have been reported in China in recent years, though the extent of that production remains unclear.

Scientists have also pointed to a less direct source: the degradation of hydrofluoroolefins, or HFOs, in the atmosphere. HFOs are a new class of chemical refrigerants that have a far lower direct impact on the climate than HFCs. However, as they break down, they can form HFC-23.

“It’s a very complex ‘whodunit,’” Perry said. “It might be like that Agatha Christie one where everybody did it.”

One solution may be to simply make less of the chemicals that produce such potent greenhouse gases. One way to do this would be to limit the production of HCFC-22 and other chemical feedstocks under the Montreal Protocol, Andersen, of IGSD, said.

“These factories are just big chemical cocktail factories,” Perry said. “As long as you’re making products with chlorine and fluorine, you are basically risking having emissions of things that will either deplete the ozone layer or warm up the climate.”

As a starting point, environmental advocates say China must keep a much closer eye on its HCFC-22 factories to ensure they aren’t emitting or leaking HFC-23. Beyond that, Hu said that China needs to step up monitoring around fluoride chemical plants to better understand the extent of emissions originating from those facilities.

At the same time, global emissions monitoring remains critical—and is potentially under threat. HCFC-22 is also manufactured in India, Russia, and other parts of China. However, the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE), the global monitoring network used to detect HFC-23 emissions, is unable to quantify emissions from these locations due to a lack of monitoring stations in these regions.

And that capacity could decrease further. NASA’s Earth Sciences Division provides at least partial funding to five of the AGAGE network’s 16 air monitoring stations worldwide. The Trump administration sought to cut funding to the division in half in the 2026 budget request it sent to Congress earlier this month.

“Everybody is afraid that they want to blind the science,” Andersen said. “Some people think if you don’t see it, it won’t matter. It’s the ostrich with its head in the sand.”

NASA has already canceled 145 grants and contracts totaling $113 million since late January, according to an online database compiled by the Planetary Society, a space advocacy group. Grants to two U.S. universities for the AGAGE network remained active as of May 2, NASA confirmed in response to a public records request by Inside Climate News.

Curbing global monitoring would put U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage, because plants operating in areas with no oversight could forgo pollution controls and their associated costs, Andersen said. “For the U.S. and Europe, who have done a good job of reducing their emissions, while other countries are blowing HFC-23 into the atmosphere, this is unfair competition, this is outrageous,” Andersen said.

Chinese Leadership Makes Economic Push

Just over a week after U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to a temporary pause on skyrocketing tariffs, effective rates remain at record highs.

According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, average U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports stand at 51.1 percent, while average Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports stand at 32.6 percent. These figures are considerably higher than those in most headlines—30 percent and 10 percent, respectively.

And though Chinese factories are taking advantage of the rate reduction from 145 percent and spinning up production lines for U.S. customers again, the chilly trade climate is still hampering the Chinese economy. April’s economic figures, released Monday, indicate that consumer spending and sentiment, among other metrics, remain weak.

A marked divide in responses is emerging between the Chinese government, which is eager to make the economy more self-sufficient, and factories that can’t survive without global markets. China’s political leadership has long aimed to boost domestic consumption, but it is hindered by the public’s inclination toward saving rather than spending.

Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature dual circulation strategy, introduced in 2020, intended to reduce the role of foreign trade while encouraging domestic spending. Instead, it ran into the wall of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the financial stress of lockdowns made saving even more important.

With the trade war still on—albeit at a lower intensity—on Tuesday China’s central bank responded by cutting benchmark lending rates by 10 basis points to encourage domestic investment. Meanwhile, Chinese Premier Li Qiang attended and promoted a big meeting among officials last week to encourage “domestic circulation.”

Li has made outreach to business central to his role, but the community shows little optimism for a domestic push for consumption.

The exception is the technology sector: The success of the Chinese company DeepSeek’s large language model, DeepSeek-R1, along with government encouragement, is spurring an artificial intelligence (AI) rush. Clean energy, which has caused a drop in China’s carbon emissions for the first time, also continues to grow rapidly.

But factories can’t simply shove AI into microwaves or children’s toys, and they also can’t find new domestic markets amid a deflationary spiral and with a bruised public that is worried about trade tensions with the United States.

That means turning to other, often fraudulent, ways of increasing sales. The chief method, however, is to find a way around U.S. tariffs. That was the case during U.S. President Donald Trump’s first term, when Mexico and Vietnam became popular destinations for Chinese transshipment.

The United States has pressured Vietnam to stop this practice, but transshipments to the country nevertheless reached a post-pandemic high last month. Plus, many Chinese firms are outright moving manufacturing to Vietnam, bypassing the need for transshipment altogether.

But manufacturing can also be a cover. In Vietnam, local factories, especially those run by Chinese firms, often import and relabel Chinese-made goods. They are aided by highly developed smuggling and organized crime networks along China’s borders with Southeast Asian countries, often with the collusion of Chinese military officers.

What We’re Following

Belt-tightening campaign. China’s dour economic outlook has prompted new calls for government frugality from the top echelons of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Alcohol, cigarettes, gourmet food, and fancy flowers are out; thrift, recycling, and austerity are in.

There is a real need for local governments to cut back on spending, since they face a far-reaching budget crisis spurred by the pandemic and the collapse of the real estate bubble. That has forced them to raise money by any means possible. But frugality is unlikely to be an effective solution. Xi has repeatedly tried such campaigns, and they never seem to have permanent effects.

But austerity campaigns are also often public relations campaigns. Public anger about corruption was one of the factors that elevated Xi as an unusually powerful leader, since he promised the CCP that he would both control graft and crack down on media exposing corruption.

The latest austerity campaign is especially timely given the recent “4+4” scandal, which highlighted the pervasive nepotism within the CCP, which is known to be dominated by powerful families. (Xi is the son of a former top leader, and his first wife was the daughter of a high-ranking diplomat.)

COVID-19 wave hits children. A wave of COVID-19 infections in Hong Kong has had unusually serious effects on children, with pediatric wards full and several young patients critically ill. Thankfully, the disease is usually mild in children, though it can have lasting effects. Doctors note that most of the Hong Kong patients are unvaccinated.

Given Hong Kong’s status as a travel hub, if a new variant has emerged, it could have a global impact, especially given the Trump administration’s reversal of previous childhood vaccination policy.

FP’s Most Read This Week

Tech and Business

HarmonyOS. On Monday, Huawei launched its first laptop computers, which run the Chinese operating system HarmonyOS, intended as an alternative to Microsoft Windows and Apple’s macOS. HarmonyOS was initially compatible with Android—and often accused of copying it— but is now its own ecosystem, though it is relatively underdeveloped.

Huawei boasts having more than 1,000 available apps, but that pales in comparison to the roughly 1.8 million apps on Apple’s App Store.

Nevertheless, the Chinese government has a strong interest in a purely domestic operating system due to fears that foreign models create security vulnerabilities that U.S. intelligence actors could exploit. Recent bans on foreign chips in government computers also emphasize security concerns, but previous attempts to ban Windows for official use have often failed in practice.

Global tax push. China and the United States are the only two countries that attempt to tax their nationals living abroad. But though the United States’ key role in global banking allows it to keep closer track of its citizens’ finances, China has generally struggled to do so.

A government effort formally announced in March is now using big data to trace foreign investments, which are also tax-liable. But China’s tight capital controls have already produced a large money laundering industry that rich citizens make plentiful use of, making it very difficult to trace their global investments.

South Africa’s Diplomatic Gambit

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday in an attempt to mend bilateral relations, which have deteriorated in recent months as Trump has parroted claims that white South Africans are facing “unjust racial discrimination” and “genocide.”

This is the first time that Trump will host an African leader in his second term. At the meeting, Ramaphosa is expected to propose a comprehensive trade deal as a way to reset the U.S.-South Africa relationship.

Since he took office in January, Trump has cut aid to South Africa, expelled its ambassador, signaled plans to boycott the G-20 summit in Johannesburg in November, and reportedly banned U.S. agencies from working on the summit. Trump also announced a 31 percent tariff on South African imports as part of his recent tariffs scheme.

Last week, tensions worsened as Washington granted refugee status to 59 white South Africans—a move that Pretoria said was “entirely politically motivated and designed to question South Africa’s constitutional democracy.”

Trump’s main grievance is South Africa’s new Expropriation Act, aimed at redressing apartheid-era land inequality, which allows Pretoria to seize property in limited circumstances. (No land has been expropriated under the law yet.) Since his first term, Trump has also repeatedly claimed without evidence that white South African farmers are victims of targeted killings and discrimination.

Pretoria’s broader diversity laws are also in the firing line as the Trump administration attacks diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts at home and abroad. Trump’s billionaire advisor Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has been a vocal critic of Pretoria’s policies, which he has called “openly racist.”

But Trump’s stance against Pretoria is not just about its domestic politics. He has also criticized South Africa’s relationship with Iran and its position on Israel’s war in Gaza. Trump’s February executive order on South Africa cites “aggressive positions towards the United States and its allies, including accusing Israel, not Hamas, of genocide in the International Court of Justice, and reinvigorating its relations with Iran to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.”

Ramaphosa is expected to challenge Trump’s understanding of the treatment of Afrikaners, the descendants of mostly Dutch settlers, in South Africa. Pretoria’s delegation to the White House includes John Steenhuisen, the agriculture minister and leader of the majority-white Democratic Alliance party, who will likely help dispute the White House’s false claims of white genocide.

“There is no genocide in South Africa,” Steenhuisen said last week. “What we need to do is to make sure that when important trading partners like the U.S. are making decisions around their outlook … they are making it based on the facts and not the fiction.”

There are fears among the South African public and politicians that Ramaphosa may be humiliated like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose meeting with Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance at the White House in February descended into a shouting match.

Yet Ramaphosa is reportedly unfazed and hopes to placate Trump with business opportunities, including by making concessions on sectors such as critical minerals and agriculture. South Africa is the United States’ largest African trading partner; in 2024, bilateral trade totaled around $20.5 billion.

“We will be conducting our discussions in a business-like manner,” Ramaphosa told reporters on Friday. “We are not going to be distracted by anything. We will just focus on what is important to our country. … You also negotiate with those that you may have differences with.”

Ramaphosa may try to charm Trump by reextending an invitation to play on South Africa’s golf courses.

While he’s in Washington, Ramaphosa is also expected to bring up business opportunities for Musk, which could include a proposal for Tesla to receive favorable tariffs on imports to South Africa. He reportedly plans to offer Musk a workaround of Black-ownership laws so that Starlink, Musk’s satellite internet business, can enter the South African market.

The Week Ahead

Wednesday, May 21: Trump and Ramaphosa are scheduled to meet at the White House.

South Africa’s finance minister presents the country’s third revised budget.

European Union and African Union foreign ministers meet in Brussels to discuss how to strengthen cooperation.

Tuesday, May 27, to Thursday, May 29: The West Africa Industrialisation, Manufacturing & Trade Summit is held in Lagos, Nigeria.

What We’re Watching

Sudan’s new prime minister. On Monday, Sudanese army chief Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan appointed Kamil al-Tayeb Idris as the country’s first prime minister since civil war broke out in 2023. Idris is a career diplomat who formerly led the United Nations’ World Intellectual Property Organization.

Idris is tasked with forming a new government at a time when the civilian death toll is worsening in Sudan’s civil war as it enters a new phase marked by the use of foreign drones. Meanwhile, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has established its own rival government.

Nigeria-China defense pact. Nigeria signed a defense agreement with a Chinese company during Nigerian Minister of State for Defense Bello Matawalle’s visit to Beijing in early May. The Chinese firm has agreed to establish local manufacturing capabilities, invest in military training and equipment servicing, and facilitate technology transfers to Nigeria.

Although Nigerian officials did not name the Chinese company in its statement announcing the deal, a delegation from China’s North Industries Corp. (Norinco) visited Abuja in March. Nigeria looks to bolster its air defense systems amid a resurgence of extremist groups. Islamist insurgents attacked four military bases in northeastern Nigeria over a 24-hour period last week.

Beijing has stepped up its defense cooperation with African nations in recent years. Norinco, China’s largest state-owned arms manufacturer, has worked with Algeria, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, and Senegal. Last week, China hosted 100 military officers from 40 African countries at its military academies.

Unrest in Libya. Multiple officials resigned from Libya’s Tripoli-based government on Friday, including Economy and Trade Minister Mohamed al-Hawij, amid protests calling for Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah to step down, according to Libyan media reports.

The demonstrations followed armed fighting that broke out in Tripoli on May 12 after the killing of Abdel Ghani al-Kikli, the leader of a powerful armed group, by a rival militia. The clashes have led to the deaths of at least eight civilians.

U.S.-Africa summit. Trump will host a summit for African leaders by the end of the year, according to Troy Fitrell, the acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs. Washington’s new Africa policy will prioritize private sector investment and dealmaking, Fitrell said at an event last week in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

The last U.S.-Africa leaders’ summit was hosted in December 2022 by then-President Joe Biden, who faced criticism for scheduling few one-on-one meetings with his African counterparts.

Bongo leaves Gabon. Gabon’s deposed president, Ali Bongo, has left the country for Angola with his wife and son. Bongo was placed under house arrest after he was ousted in a 2023 military coup; his son, Noureddin, and wife, Sylvia, were detained on charges of money laundering and embezzling public funds. The junta accused Sylvia of manipulating her husband to misuse state assets following his stroke in 2018.

According to a statement posted on social media by the Angolan presidency, the Bongo family’s release followed an agreement between Angolan President João Lourenço and Gen. Brice Oligui Nguema, Gabon’s coup leader-turned-president who won the country’s election last month.

This Week in Culture

Nigeria’s film industry is being represented for the first time in the Cannes Film Festival’s official selection with My Father’s Shadow, Akinola Davies Jr.’s semi-autobiographical directorial debut. The film, which premiered on Sunday, is set in Lagos during Nigeria’s 1993 coup, when the military annulled presidential election results and Gen. Sani Abacha seized power.

Davies co-wrote the screenplay with his brother, Wale, who said the film attempts to capture Nigerians’ hope for—and disappointments around—democracy and change. “I think with Nigeria, it’s the promise and the potential that kills you,” Wale said. “And now I’m 42, and I think even in that time we’ve lost so many people who’ve never seen this promise materialize.”

Film, music, and art are Nigeria’s biggest exports after oil, and Nollywood is the third-largest film industry in the world in terms of output.

What We’re Reading

Musk’s African profits. U.S. diplomats have used the threat of aid cuts to pressure African governments to fast-track licenses for Starlink, according to a ProPublica investigation.

In cables, senior State Department officials have suggested to their counterparts in African nations that granting licenses to Starlink would prove “their commitment to good relations with the U.S.,” according to the report. U.S. officials reportedly lobbied on Musk’s behalf in Cameroon, Djibouti, Gambia, and Lesotho.

Diverted water in Malawi. A class action lawsuit against Illovo Sugar Malawi and its parent company, Associated British Foods—which owns sugar brand Silver Spoon and retailer Primark—alleges that flood defenses around the producer’s Nchalo Sugar Estate in Malawi diverted floodwaters that killed seven people and destroyed homes in 2022, the Centre for Investigative Journalism Malawi reports.

Villagers allege that the flood barriers built to protect the plantation altered the flow of the Mwanza River, worsening the impact of flooding on their community.

Israel’s announcement of the offensive over the weekend was “the worst news that we could have received,” Yotam Cohen, the brother of Nimrod Cohen, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier who was captured by Hamas on Oct. 7 and is believed to still be alive, told Foreign Policy on May 19.

The Israeli government said its new ground offensive in Gaza is meant to raise pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. But family members of some of the hostages are condemning the offensive as fundamentally at odds with that goal, warning that escalating the conflict could have potentially fatal consequences for living hostages and make it more difficult to secure the return of the deceased ones.

Israel’s announcement of the offensive over the weekend was “the worst news that we could have received,” Yotam Cohen, the brother of Nimrod Cohen, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier who was captured by Hamas on Oct. 7 and is believed to still be alive, told Foreign Policy on May 19.

Cohen said the offensive—dubbed Operation Gideon’s Chariots—is “everything we’ve been concerned about” and “warned against” because it “can endanger the lives of the hostages.” He’s worried that the new operation will prolong the war and prevent the release of the remaining 58 hostages, roughly 20 of whom are thought to still be alive.

After intense Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed hundreds of Palestinians over the course of several days, the IDF said on May 18 that troops had begun “extensive ground operations” throughout Gaza.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on May 19 that Israel is moving to take control of “all of Gaza.” He has also ordered a limited amount of aid to be let into Gaza after a nearly three-month blockade. The Israeli leader signaled that the decision to partially lift the blockade was in response to pressure from Western allies such as the United States.

Ruby Chen, the father of American Israeli IDF soldier Itay Chen, told FP that he’s very concerned the new offensive will also make it more difficult to retrieve the remains of deceased hostages like his son.

Itay was initially thought to be held alive by Hamas, but the IDF reported in March that he’d been killed on Oct. 7, 2023, and that his body was taken into Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed that it has the Israeli soldier’s remains.

Chen, who decried Hamas’s actions as the “lowest form of psychological warfare that you can think of,” recently urged the United Nations Security Council to enforce a resolution that obligates parties in armed conflicts to return the remains of missing persons. “We just need to have closure,” Chen said. “We are all children of God.”

But Chen also sees the Israeli government as part of the problem. Netanyahu “doesn’t know how to finish,” Chen said. The United States has given Netanyahu a “blank check” throughout the war to “do whatever he wants,” Chen said, but the Israeli leader has been “unsuccessful.” Regarding the new ground offensive in Gaza, Chen said it’s hard to understand why Netanyahu believes “using the same tactic will get a different outcome.”

Critics of Netanyahu have accused him of continuing the war in order to appease far-right members of his fragile coalition government and thus ensure his own political survival.

Cohen said he and his family members were among the first relatives of hostages to “publicly state that we think that the government is prolonging the war for political or personal reasons,” adding that they’re “seeing more and more evidence there is no reason to continue the war” as time goes on.

As they keep pushing for the release of the remaining hostages, both Cohen and Chen said that the Trump administration has been far more communicative and helpful than the Israeli government.

Chen applauded the Trump administration—and particularly U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, whom he said has a “big Jewish heart”—for recently securing the release of American Israeli hostage Edan Alexander.

“I have to say, as an Israeli citizen, we’re getting much more updates and much more help from the American administration than what we’re getting from the Israeli government. Even though I’m an Israeli citizen, the amount of support, help, and cooperation we’ve been getting from the U.S. administration, from this current administration, is astounding,” Cohen said. “I feel betrayed by my country, which is a terrible feeling.”

But recent pressure put on the Israeli government by the United States and European countries is a “positive” development, Cohen added, and “hopefully it will prevent or at least halt the ground campaign inside Gaza.”

The leaders of France, Canada, and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement on May 19 condemning the Israeli government for ramping up the war in Gaza.

“We strongly oppose the expansion of Israel’s military operations in Gaza. The level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable,” the statement read. It criticized Netanyahu’s announcement that a “basic quantity” of food would be let in as “wholly inadequate.”

“We will not stand by while the Netanyahu Government pursues these egregious actions,” the statement warned. “If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response.”

Macroeconomic projections from the University of Denver similarly warn that cuts to U.S. foreign aid programs will push an additional 19 million Africans into extreme poverty by 2030. The imposition of sweeping tariffs against all African economies, large and small —should they last—will only make African livelihoods more precarious.

The Trump administration’s first 100 days in power signaled a sharp and dramatic reorientation of the U.S. relationship with Africa. Public health forecasting models estimate that the administration’s grave cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief will result in 26 million additional HIV infections, 15 million preventable AIDS deaths, and 14 million more children orphaned by AIDS by 2040, with more than 60 percent of these impacts concentrated in only six African countries.

The imposition of sweeping tariffs against all African economies, large and small—should they last—will only make African livelihoods more precarious.

Beyond the cuts to aid and trade, a steady stream of leaked predecisional documents portend a deeper U.S. retreat from engagement in Africa. On March 14, the New York Times and other media outlets reported on a draft “travel ban” that would impose more stringent travel requirements on 43 countries, 22 of which are African. Four days later, NBC News reviewed internal Defense Department proposals that would result in the elimination of the U.S. Africa Command (Africom) as an independent geographic combatant command of the Pentagon.

In mid-April, African headlines were dominated by a leaked draft executive order that would close embassies across the continent and perhaps even completely eliminate the Bureau of African Affairs, which oversees U.S. relations with 49 countries. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s recent announcement of his department’s reorganization plans indicated that the Africa bureau will remain in place for now, but it offered little clarity on the broader strategic vision for U.S. engagement with the continent.

Though perhaps too early to tell, the Trump administration’s foreign policy toward Africa shows clear signs of being driven by transactionalism. Through this lens, Africa is not likely to be judged by its long-term potential or the future strategic risks of disengagement. Instead, under the “America First” approach, relationships are likely to be measured by their immediate benefits and the potential to offer tangible, clear, and easily messaged “wins” that show a return on investment to U.S. audiences.

This approach means that partnerships and interests will become increasingly conditional. Whether via security cooperation or economic investment, U.S. policy toward Africa is unlikely to be framed as part of a broader global effort to protect the rules-based international order, promote democratic norms, or advance development and human rights. Many African states, especially those facing internal instability or lacking the capacity to reciprocate in strategic or economic terms, are likely to find themselves on the outside looking in.

But instead of retreating from Africa, the Trump administration should embrace a smarter form of transactionalism. U.S.-Africa policy can still prioritize tangible returns, but those returns should come through investments that build enduring partnerships, not through quick exits or short- or one-sided gains. Those may seem seductive, but they risk strategically crippling the United States at the exact moment when adversaries are looking to capitalize.

To do so, U.S. policy toward Africa should refocus around four strategic priorities: supporting resilient and self-sufficient regional organizations; curbing threats to U.S. security at their source; fostering African support for U.S. positions in international institutions; and co-developing a positive economic vision for the continent that promotes economic development and integration while resisting the extractive and abusive economic practices of rival global powers.

Pursuing this approach would preserve an “America First” strategy while respecting an “Africa First” vision built on partnerships, not dependency.

When President George W. Bush went on a five-nation tour of the continent in 2008, he claimed that rather than establish a significant military presence around the continent, the mission of the new U.S. Africa Command would be to “help African leaders solve the continent’s crises.” Today, African states remain plagued by enduring conflicts in several regional conflict zones, but important Africa-led, U.S.-supported security cooperation efforts have been successful and provided valuable lessons for further investments around the continent.

In the Gulf of Guinea, for example—a comprehensive interagency approach involving the U.S. departments of Defense and State, USAID, the Coast Guard, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among other agencies—has contributed to a robust regional maritime security architecture. With U.S. and other international support, African states and regional security institutions have been the primary designers and implementers of new frameworks for coordinating regional efforts to combat piracy, trafficking, fisheries crimes, and other maritime threats.

Significant security gains have been made in the gulf, including a roughly 90percent drop in piracy and armed robbery incidents between 2020 and 2024, despite Washington and other international partners having a minimal military footprint in the region. Effectively, this Africa-led, U.S.-supported effort has improved so-called security burden-sharing with African partners and allowed the United States to allocate more resources and attention to counterterrorism, an outcome that is certainly in line with the Trump administration’s “America First” priorities.

Successes such as the Gulf of Guinea security architecture should shape future U.S. efforts to support African-led solutions. Organizations including the African Union and Africa Standby Force, alongside regional economic communities such as the Economic Community of West African States and Southern African Development Community, are critical actors for intracontinental relationships. These organizations have played essential roles ranging from economic cooperation to crisis response and prevention. Washington’s Africa policy should focus on providing support and expertise to these initiatives.

Critics of increased U.S. engagement in Africa are sometimes eager to criticize Washington for dominating responses to supposedly African problems, but this critique ignores the transnational nature of the continent’s most pressing security challenges. Problems such as civil war, terrorism, military rule, public health crises, and black-market economies will not be solved without African leadership—but these problems, if left unchecked, will undermine U.S. security whether or not Washington chooses to remain engaged.

Consider the global drug trade and the Trump administration’s clear concern over narcotics trafficking. Parts of Africa have been integral nodes in the global drug trade—particularly in West Africa, which has historically served as a key transit hub and corridor for narcotics trafficking to Europe and beyond. But there is no reason that this threat will remain confined to Europe as criminal syndicates evolve, mature, and expand.

The Sahel region’s deteriorating security situation, brought on by an intricate web of terrorism, domestic conflict, coups, and corruption, has also raised alarms among analysts who warn of an emerging nexus between organized crime and violent extremist groups. There is a real risk of the region evolving into a hub of narco-terrorism where al Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates benefit.

In addition, migrant smuggling and trafficking has remained a persistent issue around the continent and has shown no signs of slowing down. Europe’s efforts to quell and crack down on migration flows through North Africa have pushed many migrants to pursue alternative destinations. Thousands of African migrants, for instance, have opted to make the trek to the United States, often via routes leading to the U.S. southern border with Mexico.

And as the COVID-19 pandemic showed, disease outbreaks do not respect geography. The best defense comes from proactive engagement to develop resilient health systems—not reactionary policies. Reconsidering aid cuts and investing in early detection, rapid response capabilities, and basic public health infrastructure in Africa is a smart investment..

Addressing these problems closer to their source, through targeted and selective engagement, can advance U.S. security while minimizing the need for costly interventions later.

Despite the Trump administration’s skepticism toward international institutions, organizations such as the United Nations remain essential arenas for advancing U.S. strategic interests. China and Russia use the U.N. and other intergovernmental bodies to win favor for their actions, legitimize their views of a post-U.S. global order, and amplify their narratives. They also recognize the importance of African votes, as they form a voting bloc of more than a quarter of the world’s sovereign states.

Africa represents the largest regional voting bloc in the United Nations General Assembly, with 54 member states. That gives African countries significant collective influence. That influence is seen in the bloc’s voting behavior over the war in Ukraine. In a General Assembly vote condemning Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, African countries accounted for nearly half of all abstentions. Later, some countries that have grown increasingly close to Moscow (e.g., Mali), shifted their voting on Ukrainian issues in favor of Russia.

Beijing and Moscow are only likely to increase their diplomatic onslaughts at the U.N. in an effort to win friends and allies in addition to courting partners via African leaders’ summits. If the United States continues to treat Africa as a peripheral interest while strategic adversaries do not, its indifference risks being reciprocated in international institutions.

Trump’s first term saw the establishment of the “Prosper Africa” program, an effort aimed to boost U.S.-Africa trade through increased private sector investment across the continent. The initiative was designed to align with the America First approach by opening African markets to U.S. businesses—it was a way of positioning the United States as an economic counterweight to China.

It was also heralded as an important pivot away from simply delivering development aid or humanitarian assistance, which had come to define U.S.-Africa relations. Foundationally, the program’s design aligns with the transactional approach that is likely to define the Trump administration’s Africa policy this time around. But the status and future of that program, which was primarily housed under USAID, is unclear.

Moreover, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), enacted in 2000, has given more than 30 African states access to U.S. markets without import tariffs for certain products. The payoffs have been significant for several African states. For instance, Deutsche Welle reported that under the program, Kenya’s apparel exports to the United States grew from $55 million in 2001 to $603 million in 2022, comprising nearly 68 percent of Kenya’s total exports to the United States.

Despite such successes, the Trump administration’s preferences for tariffs as a bargaining tool suggest that AGOA is unlikely to be renewed when it expires in September. Letting this legislation lapse would not only damage bilateral economic ties and create opportunities for China to consolidate its trade dominance, but would also undercut the value of long-term economic partnerships.

Arguments about the geostrategic importance of Africa are not new, and talking points about future economic potential, rapid population growth, strategic geographic positioning along vital sea lanes, and deposits of critical mineral resources have been echoed for decades. This belief in the long-term strategic value of the continent is exactly what motivated the creation of Africom nearly 20 years ago and inspired the Biden administration’s “Africa Strategy” in 2022.

Even as the new administration shifts the focus to short-term transactionalism, this is not the time to turn away from strategic priorities in Africa. Retreating from the continent risks sending signals of unreliability at a time when credibility and commitment are precious commodities. Pursuing these four objectives would provide Washington the opportunity to realize tangible, near-term gains that are mutually beneficial. They would also reduce the costs that would surely arise for any future intervention and would improve prospects for support of U.S. priorities globally while blunting the influence of China and Russia.

Through commitment, not retrenchment, the Trump administration can protect U.S. interests, reinforce American leadership, and secure tangible returns on investment in a region whose global significance is only set to grow.

Israeli Economy Minister Nir Barkat, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party who is considered a potential future contender for prime minister , sat down with Foreign Policy on Thursday for a wide-ranging interview. Barkat insisted that Netanyahu and Trump remain “very, very close,” despite the fact that the president just traveled through the Middle East without making a stop in Israel. He also offered his thoughts on the ongoing Israeli blockade on aid into Gaza, U.S. negotiations with Iran, the potential for a trade deal between the United States and Israel, and more.

During his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump’s policy toward Israel was typified by strong support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his agenda.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Foreign Policy: The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation on Wednesday said it received approval from Israel to begin delivering at least some aid into the territory in the coming days, but I’ve seen no public confirmation from the Israeli government on this. Can you confirm this?

Nir Barkat: You’re talking about [when] the 58 hostages that are in the dungeons in Gaza are going to receive aid from the world?

FP: No, I’m asking can you confirm whether or not that this organization is going to be permitted to deliver some aid into Gaza in the coming days, as has been publicly announced? I’ve seen no confirmation from the Israeli government on that.

NB: My question is, what about the 58 hostages that are not getting any aid?

FP: That’s a fair question, but I’m here to ask you questions, sir. It’s not my responsibility to bring aid to the hostages.

NB: That’s my answer. My answer is that the whole issue can be resolved in a minute. The minute Hamas surrenders and it brings back the 58 hostages—the war is going to be over in a minute.

FP: The Israeli blockade on aid into Gaza has lasted for over two months. Other than Edan Alexander, Hamas has not released the remaining hostages, as you just noted. And there are concerns that half a million people are on the brink of starvation. In this sense, the blockade does not appear to be working. Why continue it if the hostages are not being released?

NB: You should ask Hamas that question. Ask Hamas the question, why aren’t they dropping their weapons? And if they care about their people and bring our hostages back, everything will be stopped in a minute.

FP: So, just to follow up, you cannot confirm whether or not any aid will be allowed in the next two weeks, as this organization has announced?

NB: I cannot. I’m not part of the [security] cabinet, so I cannot answer that question.

FP: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already visited the White House twice during Trump’s second term. Do you see it as a snub that Trump has been traveling through the Middle East but didn’t make time to visit Israel this week?

NB: He made it very clear that his mission is an economic mission and he had those specific goals and that’s why he traveled to where he traveled in the Middle East. Mind you that the relationship between Israel and the United States, and Netanyahu and Trump, is very, very close.

He was the first to visit the United States, and the relationship and the collaboration is very high.

So Trump’s goal was economic, and I assume that’s the reason he visited the Middle East.

FP: Speaking of economic goals, not too long ago you expressed optimism about the prospect of a trade deal between Israel and the United States ahead of the July 9 expiration of the pause on tariffs. Are you still optimistic? What’s the status of the talks for a new trade deal between the United States and Israel?

NB: The team, the professional team, was in the United States last week. We’re now preparing for the next round. It’s an iterative process.

I’m going to be in Washington next week, and I am sure that we’ll be able to come up with a good deal together between the two countries. I’m very optimistic.

FP: What issues in particular are you hoping to hash out the details on for this deal?

NB: There’s regulatory issues. We would like to expand the reforms I’ve introduced, basically opening up the regulations in Israel to allow products from Europe to come in directly to Israel. We want to expand that. And whatever is good for the United States is good for Israel. We’re expanding the regulation side.

We have some ideas on how to shift some purchases and acquisitions from other places in the world to the United States to decrease the trade deficit between the two countries. We’re happy to do that. And a couple of other recommendations or proposals are on the table. Some of them are a mutual understanding of how to look at this as an opportunity.

On top of that, I’m going to be proposing a lot of business development between the two countries. Not just trade. And how can we make one plus one equal three between Israel and the United States and other countries as well?

The United States is the biggest trade partner that Israel has, it’s a very special relationship, and we want to maintain that mutual approach of collaboration between the two countries.

FP: The Trump administration directly negotiated with Hamas for the release of Edan Alexander. Is that concerning to the Israeli government?

NB: Every release of every hostage is good. We’re thankful. We hug Edan, and we’re really, really happy to see him home. I don’t think it’s prudent to discuss the details of a release here and a release there. Strategically, Israel is totally aligned with the United States. We’re all together, we understand, and we are very thankful to the Trump administration for the huge support we get. For the veto power in the U.N., and for the supplies, and the major, major support Israel receives from the United States. So we’re very thankful, and we’re happy for every release of every hostage that is captured now and is still under the dungeons of the evilness of Hamas.

FP: Are you at all concerned that the ongoing blockade on aid will also harm the hostages and will make it harder for them to get the assistance they need?

NB: I think the world recognizes that the way they’re treated in the tunnels—they’re not treated as human beings. No Red Cross, no light, no sun, a terrible situation. Some of them are brutally beaten. This is totally, totally unacceptable what is happening to them.

And [it’s] one of the reasons to put pressure on Hamas to swiftly surrender. That’s what we need to do. The Israeli government believes that making Hamas surrender and bringing the hostages [home] are two complementary goals that must be completed hopefully in the near future. And that’s why the Israeli army recruited the reservists and we are eager to get in and to finish the job and to bring all the hostages back.

The two rounds of releasing hostages in the past was while the Israeli army was maneuvering in Gaza. When there’s pressure on Hamas, they come to the table and do deals. So we believe that this is the right thing to do, and we want to end this as quickly as possible.

FP: The United States and the Houthis recently reached a cease-fire agreement, even though the Iran-backed group vowed to continue striking Israel. Was the Israeli government blindsided by this deal?

NB: I think that the Americans are focusing on American interests, and we’re focusing on Israeli interests. The majority of the time, they are totally aligned. We know how to deal with the Houthis, and we demonstrated that just a while ago. They’re continuing firing at Israel, including today, and they will pay a heavy price until they stop.

By the way, I want to add one more thing here, which is my personal opinion of how to deal with this. And that is to adopt the strategy of [U.S.] President [John F.] Kennedy at the time of the Cuban missile crisis, where he said to the Soviet Union that a missile coming from Cuba at American cities will be answered with a missile on Moscow.

And from my perspective, a missile from Lebanon and any other proxy, including of course the Houthis, on Israel—Tehran should be attacked. If we don’t sleep good at night, they in Tehran will not sleep good [at] night. And I think the time is ready for Iran to start paying. They have a big open bill with us.

And I think it’s time to implement the strategy of targeting Iran, making sure they pay a heavy price for what they’ve done. They have a lot of blood on their hands. And it’s very clear to me that it’s not just making sure that they do not have a nuclear bomb, but it’s also making sure they pay a heavy price for their conventional targeting and fighting against Israel.

FP: Trump on Thursday said the United States and Iran are “very close” to reaching a new agreement over Iran’s nuclear program. The administration has sent mixed signals over whether or not it would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium for civilian purposes. Is Israel concerned about the Trump administration’s approach to this and the potential for sanctions to be lifted on Iran?

NB: Well, we have our interests in Israel. We will not take any risk on Iran. We don’t trust them. They will tell the world whatever they need to tell to gain time, to detract attention. So the United States is negotiating. And if and when we understand that the goal has been reached with respect to not having a nuclear bomb—call me again. But at this point, we do not trust the Iranian regime, and we believe that their goal has not changed. And they’re trying to fool the world. We will never be fooled. We believe them, and we will fight them until they drop their weapon and stop trying to create a bomb.

FP: Trump this week seemed to even surprise some of his own officials by announcing he was completely lifting sanctions on Syria. Based on public statements from the Israeli government and recent Israeli military activities, Israel is clearly concerned about the new Syrian government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa. Was it the right call for Trump to lift sanctions on Syria at this moment?

NB: We’re observing the new leadership of Syria. If you look in retrospect, in their past—they’re terrorists. The key question is, how will they act in the future and in the near future? And it’s still up in the air. We want to make sure that they are friendly. We want to make sure that we manage the risk associated with Syria carefully. We want to make sure that our partners or people that we care about, the Druze and the Kurds, are secure and safe.

Beyond that, if we find that they’re serious and committed to join the Abraham Accords—Israel’s doors [are] always open. But we just want to make sure that it’s real and we’re not fooled by the terrorist new regime in Syria.

FP: What would you say to those who think that Trump has been deliberately bypassing Israel and Netanyahu on an array of issues, like Syria, the hostage release, and Iran negotiations? Do you think this is deliberate?

NB: I think we’re best friends and we’re well aligned. We are very thankful for the support we get. Basically, what we’re saying is that there may be differences in vision and opinions and interest between the two countries, but that will not deter us from a deep understanding of the relationship we have with the administration. Trump’s administration has moved from being restraining to supportive, and I think that that’s very fruitful and helpful for Israel.

Again, we’ll see how things develop. But it’s certainly OK that we have some differences of approach, but strategically the bond between Israel and the United States is as strong as it ever was, and I believe it’s going to continue this way.

Farther west, European NATO states are scrambling to rearm. Several NATO defense chiefs warn that the alliance must be ready to confront a Russian attack on one or more of the bloc’s members within three to seven years. More starkly, Danish officials have warned that Russia could launch some sort of attack within six months of the war in Ukraine slowing or ending.

Russia planned its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine as a decisive, three-day campaign that would take its troops into Kyiv and quickly topple the Ukrainian government. More than three years later, that scenario remains a Russian pipedream. Suffering horrific casualties and losses of equipment, Russian forces are bogged down along a static front line hundreds of miles from Kyiv. While Russia has made incremental tactical gains over the past year, there is absolutely no sign of a military breakthrough anytime soon.

These two images of Russia are difficult to reconcile: a Russia that is dismally failing to reach its ambitions in Ukraine and a Russia that poses an existential threat to NATO, especially the Eastern European states.

The key to this apparent paradox lies in understanding that a NATO-Russia war would likely be very different from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s primary goal in a war against NATO would not be to seize large territories—at least not initially—but to destroy the alliance as a political and military entity capable of opposing Russia. Doing so would not require defeating NATO’s forces in open battle and marching into Berlin.

Rather, it would entail destroying NATO’s unity and resolve, with the Kremlin betting that the alliance would fracture under pressure. Generating the forces for such a pressure tactic is likely manageable for Russia in the short term, particularly once fighting in Ukraine has slowed or ended. Russia therefore poses a severe and existential threat to NATO in a fundamentally different way from the type of war we see in Ukraine.

Contrary to Russia’s bellicose propaganda, Moscow’s political and military elites understand that Russia would likely lose a full-on conventional war with NATO, even without U.S. involvement. For Russia, avoiding a prolonged attritional conflict and securing a swift, favorable resolution is therefore essential.

A Russian attack on NATO would therefore not primarily aim to destroy the alliance’s overall capacity to wage war, although degrading its short-term military potential would likely be an early goal. The central effort would focus on undermining NATO’s resolve and willingness to resist. Russia will likely favor a short, high-intensity campaign designed to fracture NATO’s political cohesion. The aim would be to keep the confrontation localized, involving only one or a few NATO states at most, and to end it quickly.

A plausible scenario could begin with a limited incursion into NATO territory at a perceived weak point—for example, in one or more of the Baltic states. After the initial attack, Russia might declare that any attempt to retake the occupied area would trigger nuclear escalation—a strategy that military analysts call aggressive sanctuarization. To reinforce this, Russia could arm and disperse several missiles equipped with tactical nuclear warheads and declare readiness to launch at a moment’s notice. If NATO prepared a counterattack, Russia could escalate further by striking civilian infrastructure deep inside Europe with conventionally armed missiles, signaling that continued resistance only raises the costs. Should Russia conclude that a more drastic escalation would serve its interests, nuclear warning shots into the European rear cannot be ruled out.

This type of attack would be a high-stakes gamble. It would rely on the assumption that, as NATO’s resolve weakens under the strain of escalating conventional and nuclear threats, possible missile strikes in the European rear, and accompanying sabotage and other gray-zone operations, the alliance would de facto capitulate.

Russian decision-makers likely do not anticipate a uniform surrender across NATO. They would almost certainly expect strong resistance from some members, particularly those in Eastern Europe. Still, the Kremlin may believe that the United States and key Western European allies, when faced with real consequences on their soil, would falter and refrain from defending their partners. Any reluctance to defend an attacked NATO member would signal the effective collapse of the alliance—Russia’s primary objective and a precondition for asserting regional dominance.

Russia’s decision to attack one or more European NATO states would therefore hinge less on the balance of forces and more on the perceived balance of resolve. While Russian troops have repeatedly faltered in Ukraine, there is little doubt about Russia’s determination to overturn the post-Cold War order and reestablish a sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. Coupled with what Russia perceives as recurring Western risk aversion and low tolerance for pain, this creates a dangerous mix that could tempt Russian decision-makers to act sooner rather than later.

What would Russia need to carry out such a limited attack?

First, it would require a tip-of-the-spear force capable of breaching NATO’s border at a weak point, supported by sufficient follow-on forces to occupy a small but strategically relevant portion of NATO territory. Breaching fortified defenses has become more difficult in modern warfare, largely due to the large-scale proliferation of tactical drones, which inflict heavy losses even on small maneuver elements once they leave cover. However, the war in Ukraine also shows that these same technologies, when properly employed, can help overcome defenses. For example, Russian drone teams played a key role in breaching Ukrainian defensive positions in the Kursk region and reestablishing control. Together with Ukraine, Russia now fields some of the most capable drone pilots in the world—experienced, battle-hardened, and likely far superior to their NATO counterparts in an initial encounter.

Drones alone do not win wars, of course. Russia would also require traditional mobile forces to take and hold territory: well-trained infantry, armored vehicles, tanks, and support units. Recent intelligence reports suggest that Russia has managed to mobilized enough men not only to cover combat losses but to expand its forces. Similarly, Western officials note that Russia is producing more equipment and ammunition—including modern tanks (by Russian standards) and artillery shells—than it is sending to the front. Crucially, creating the kind of force that could succeed in a limited incursion against NATO would not require Russia to restore its full pre-2022 strength.

To create a coercive conundrum for NATO leaders, Russia would also need a credible precision nuclear force capable of threatening—and if necessary, conducting—nuclear strikes. In parallel, it would require deep reserves of conventional long-range strike weapons to threaten and carry out repeated salvos against European critical infrastructure.

In nuclear terms, Russia is already well positioned. At least as important as its estimated stockpile of about 2,000 nonstrategic warheads is the variety of delivery systems that can be nuclear-armed on short notice. On the conventional side, Russia is estimated to produce around 1,200 land-attack cruise missiles, 400 short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, and more than 6,000 long-range drones annually while working to scale up output. Although exact numbers are hard to verify, the relatively low rate of missile activity over the past winter suggests that Russia may already have acquired a significant stockpile. If the Ukraine war slows or ends, Russia would be well positioned to rapidly expand its missile reserves further.

How should NATO prepare?

One of the key variables determining the timing of a potential Russian attack is the ongoing war in Ukraine. As long as Russia must commit most, if not all, of its available resources to Ukraine, an attack on NATO territory remains unlikely—even if it cannot be entirely ruled out. As we have seen, Russia already appears to be mobilizing more than it is sending to Ukraine, and any further slowdown in the fighting will translate into growing Russian reserve arsenals for other scenarios. Only Ukraine can determine how long it will continue the fight and under what conditions it might consider a settlement with Russia. But as long as Ukraine chooses to resist, it is not only morally and legally right for European states to support it but also strategically sound. In addition, signaling commitment to Ukraine and a willingness to take calculated risks against Russia would also help shift the balance of resolve back in NATO’s favor.

At the same time, Europe must prepare for the kind of war Russia is likely planning—one that will differ significantly from the protracted conflict now unfolding in Ukraine. The best way to counter a short, high-intensity Russian campaign is to deny any incursion at the border. This requires a credible forward defense posture, which NATO still lacks. Enabling forward defense means moving more troops and equipment to the front line, especially as the United States shifts its focus elsewhere and may withdraw combat formations from Europe. As long as Europe does not shift its defense industries to a war footing and procures at a scale matching the threat, a window of vulnerability will stay open, particularly as Russia shows no signs of slowing down its war industry. Persistent denial of any Russian attack will require drones, missiles, tanks, mines, and supporting systems. Europe needs more of everything, and there is no time to lose.

European NATO states must also show the ability to respond effectively to Russian coercion, both nuclear and non-nuclear. Missile defense can help mitigate the impact of long-range strikes on European targets, but it will not be sufficient. To create deterrence, European states must similarly invest in and deploy a credible counterstrike capability, making clear that they are prepared to strike back immediately, including against Russian critical infrastructure. NATO must also signal unambiguously that while it does not seek nuclear escalation, it will not yield to nuclear threats or use—and back these words with capabilities. Given a weakening U.S. extended deterrence guarantee under U.S. President Donald Trump, European nuclear weapon states must take on a greater role by expanding and diversifying their nuclear arsenals and adapting their doctrines.

Russia has made abundantly clear that its revisionist ambitions do not end in Ukraine. It would be reckless not to prepare for war—precisely to deter it from happening in the first place. Equally misguided is assuming that such a war would resemble the war in Ukraine. If Moscow confronts NATO, it will exploit NATO’s weaknesses and play to its own strengths. A short-term, high-intensity scenario designed to fracture the alliance and remove European resistance as a relevant factor appears the most likely Russian approach. This scenario should be central to NATO’s planning as Europe rearms.

The peace has held—just about. But the sectarian power-sharing regime embedded in the agreement is flagrantly discriminatory and dysfunctional and has kept the country teetering on the edge of political crisis and renewed conflict ever since. In fact, Bosnian Serb secessionists are in the midst of another putsch attempt as we speak.

This December will mark the 30th anniversary of the signing of the most paradoxical contemporary peace treaty: the U.S.-brokered Dayton Agreement. Dayton definitively ended the 1992-95 Bosnian War, which until the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was the deadliest conflict in Europe since the end of World War II, accompanied by the first genocide on the continent since the Holocaust .

But the sectarian power-sharing regime embedded in the agreement is flagrantly discriminatory and dysfunctional and has kept the country teetering on the edge of political crisis and renewed conflict ever since. In fact, Bosnian Serb secessionists are in the midst of another putsch attempt as we speak.

There is a path forward for Bosnia and Herzegovina, however. And it does not require scuttling the Dayton Agreement in its entirety, only reforming Annex IV: the country’s constitution.

Getting to such an initiative first requires recalling the scale of the original task. The human and material toll of the Bosnian War was staggering: the deaths of 100,000 people, the displacement of fully half the population, and the destruction of most of the country’s major infrastructure. Bosnia was the site of NATO’s first-ever combat operations and the primary impetus behind the creation of the first international war crimes tribunals since Nuremberg and Tokyo.

Yet once the then presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia signed Dayton, it stuck. No other major post-1945 peace agreement has been as successful in that regard.

After an initial deployment of 60,000 NATO troops in late 1995 to enforce the agreement, today there are only 1,100 lightly armed Europeans in Bosnia as part of the EUFOR Althea mission. Bosnia is now an EU candidate state and a NATO candidate, and its society and economy have recovered to that extent that National Geographic readers named Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, their top tourist destination in 2025.

As a peace agreement, Dayton is the international gold standard. But Dayton was not just an armistice; the Bosnian Constitution, contained within the agreement, has remained a festering political quagmire.

The original logic of the Dayton Agreement was to provide each of the warring factions with a political buy-in but also force them to make significant concessions to end the war. The Bosnian government secured the preservation of Bosnia’s sovereignty as a single international subject and the reintegration of all breakaway regions into a single state. In exchange, it agreed to an extraordinary level of decentralization within Bosnia, giving Serb and Croat nationalists vast degrees of autonomy. The United States and its international partners guaranteed to uphold the integrity of the agreement but also to shepherd a process of reform that would eventually create a more functional governance regime in the country.

That delicate balance of commitments worked for the first decade after the war because the international community committed itself to making the deal work. Between 1996 and 2006, Bosnia adopted a single currency and state tax regime, a single license plate regime, a state police force, a unified armed forces, a judicial court and state prosecutor, and a litany of other reforms that rapidly pushed the country toward compatibility with EU and NATO governance standards.

The success of these efforts was such that by 2006 both the United States and the EU had begun to significantly reduce their political and diplomatic mediation efforts in Bosnia. But they grossly miscalculated because while certain key state institutions had been established, the actual division of power within the Bosnian constitutional regime was entirely on the side of the separatist elements that, while representing a minority of the population, could nevertheless rely on the legion of veto mechanisms available within the system to shut down any additional reforms and even roll back those that had been enacted.

As those efforts by Serb and Croat nationalists to disintegrate Bosnia’s postwar political order accelerated after 2006, civil rights activists began mounting their own legal campaign at the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the Bosnian Constitutional Court, targeting the ethnic power-sharing modalities that underpin most of the veto mechanisms and other associated sectarian features of the Bosnian constitutional regime, which have allowed the separatists to derail the country’s reform path.

As of 2025, nearly every major representative facet of the Bosnian Constitution—and the constitutions of the country’s two chief administrative units, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska—has been struck down as discriminatory and democratically illegitimate by the ECtHR and/or the Bosnian Constitutional Court.

Namely, because the organizing principle of postwar Bosnia is not popular representation but sectarian power-sharing. This practice reserves virtually all significant forms of legislative and executive power to the so-called constituent peoples (i.e., Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats) at the expense of all other groups and individuals in the country, including those who simply identify as citizens of the Bosnian state but also minorities such as Jews and the Romani.

This is an explicit violation of the writ of the European Convention on Human Rights, one of the foundational legal treaties of the contemporary European order, which itself is embedded directly into Article 2.2 of the Bosnian Constitution, stating that the “rights and freedoms set forth in the [convention] shall apply directly in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These shall have priority over all other law.”

In other words, the sectarian power-sharing dimensions of the Bosnian Constitution are in direct conflict with its commitments to the civic and democratic equality of all citizens. Despite a series of landmark rulings by the ECtHR since 2009 against the Bosnia state on these grounds, the most significant of which is its 2023 Kovacevic decision, there has been no meaningful movement constitutional reform.

The reasons are simple.

The entrenched, ethnically constituted ruling class in Bosnia does not want to democratize the country’s constitutional regime because they, correctly, conclude that it would diminish their political power. Instead, Croat and Serb nationalist hard-liners have used the expansive ethnic vetoes and tripwires embedded in the existing constitutional system to all but derail any semblance of rational governance.

Bosnian Serb secessionist leader Milorad Dodik, for instance—a close ally of Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Serbia’s Aleksandar Vucic—has routinely threatened to break up the country, resulting in U.S. and U.K. sanctions against virtually his entire regime and even a U.S. flyover of the country in 2024. Currently, he is engaged in his most radical assault on the Bosnian state yet, having enacted a decree banning the work of the state police and state courts in the territory of Republika Srpska. The move is flagrantly unconstitutional and a clear violation of the Dayton Agreement. Worse, it is pushing Bosnia to the brink of institutional collapse and the threat of renewed conflict.

Still, as elusive as the prospects of substantive constitutional reform in Bosnia have seemed for much of the past three decades, the political formula is hardly alchemical. I spelled out its contents in detail in a February policy report, providing both a political road map and a set of concrete proposals for achieving constitutional reform in Bosnia that could be made acceptable to all relevant stakeholders.

Getting to such a possibility first requires a comprehensive commitment to achieving constitutional reform by genuine pro-EU and pro-NATO elements in Sarajevo, which are chiefly represented by the country’s multiethnic and ethnic Bosniak political parties, respectively. On paper, these parties constitute as much as 60 percent of the lower chamber of the Bosnian Parliament.

If these parties can agree to a basic program, an ad hoc coalition should be offered to the country’s ethnic Serb and Croat opposition parties, which are already signaling their willingness to break with the dominant nationalist leadership within their communities. In fact, Serb opposition leaders in Republika Srpska have been some of the most steadfast in their criticisms of Dodik’s current adventurism.

Once the pillars of such a coalition for constitutional reform are created, it could then approach the United States and EU—currently at loggerheads but with a shared strategic interest in the long-term pacification of the Western Balkans—and ask for their political and technical assistance with the process. If the Trump administration is unwilling or unable to assist, the EU and its key capitals must step up. And if the EU is unable to act with determination in Bosnia, then it has no hope whatsoever of dealing with the likes of Russia or China.

Politically, the major ask would be to keep Serbia, Croatia, and their respective local proxies from imploding the initiative. Their acquiescence can be achieved through a combination of credible threats of sanctions or other political penalties (e.g., scuttling visa-free travel to the United States for Croatian nationals or halting EU development funds to Serbia). Technically, Washington and Brussels should guide the relevant actors in Bosnia to ensure that the contents of their agreement are sufficient to accelerate the country’s path toward EU and NATO membership.

The easiest technical plan would be to adopt a version of the 2006 April Package, a proposal that only narrowly failed to win adoption in the lower chamber of the Bosnian Parliament, updated to address the rulings of the ECtHR and the Bosnian Constitutional Court since then.

There should be no moves toward the country’s territorial reorganization at this time—which is problematic and inefficient but not an immediate priority—and the focus should be entirely on creating more rational, accountable, and democratic governance modalities, in line with the human rights convention, at the state level.

If Bosnia could finally enact substantive constitutional reform, the positive outcomes for both the country’s citizens and the international community would be legion.

It would improve the quality of governance and allow for a new, liberal political class to emerge; it would convince citizens and political officials alike that reform, even structural reform, is possible in Bosnia, creating incentives for further reform initiatives, helping to curb emigration; and it would create a competent administrative regime capable of actually realizing Bosnia’s EU and NATO aspirations, and that, in sum, would permanently foreclose any possibility of the country’s dissolution or annexation.

And if Bosnia ceases to become a concern for the international community, that leaves far greater resources for both Washington and Brussels to deal with the region’s other major problem, the Kosovo-Serbia dispute, or the plethora of other geopolitical crises that currently concern the West.

As ever, all of this depends, fundamentally, on the political will to act.

The upcoming spring session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Dayton, Ohio, is an opportunity for both senior Bosnian officials and their counterparts in Washington and the European capitals to socialize this program and even to make the first moves toward its realization ahead of next year’s general elections in the country.

Such plainly stated optimism may seem naive, but it is sober realism compared with the fantastical belief that Bosnia’s present dysfunction can persist in perpetuity without a resumption of violence.

But if the mention of additional U.S. sanctions gave rise to hopes of Trump helping to stop Russia’s war, it was not to be. On Sunday, he was back to his familiar ways of easing off on Putin and applying pressure on Ukraine. After the Kremlin proposed yet more negotiations instead of the immediate cease-fire already agreed to by Kyiv, Trump once again backed Putin — adding , for good measure, that “Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY.” In so doing, the U.S. president undercut a separate European cease-fire initiative backed up with the threat of new sanctions that the Europeans apparently thought they had coordinated with Washington. Putin is back in the driver’s seat with the White House’s support, it would seem.

For a brief moment, it seemed as though U.S. President Donald Trump were finally willing to get tough on Russia. In an April 26 post on his Truth Social platform, he excoriated Russian President Vladimir Putin for letting his forces bombard Ukrainian civilians despite professed interest in a cease-fire. Trump wrote: “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions?’ Too many people are dying!!!”

Putin is back in the driver’s seat with the White House’s support, it would seem.

If Trump were genuinely interested in pressuring Putin (a dubious assumption, I know), his advisors should tell him that this is the perfect moment to do it. For the past few weeks, the Europeans have shown striking unity and fortitude as they engineered an ultimatum for Moscow: either agree to a cease-fire or get ready for a wide array of new sanctions. (The deadline ended Monday night; lacking U.S. support, the Europeans backed down by extending their ultimatum until Thursday.)

Concerted action will be a crucial test of any new sanctions. But most importantly, the Russian economy is showing new signs of vulnerability that could be exploited by intelligent sanctions that close some of the rather large loopholes of the current regime.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it has been surprisingly successful at keeping its economy humming along—despite the historically unprecedented array of sanctions imposed by Washington and its allies. Yet a growing set of data suggests that Russia’s coping strategy is beginning to show its limits.

On April 25, the Russian Central Bank affirmed that it was keeping its main interest rate at an eye-watering 21 percent—the highest in two decades. Under its redoubtable governor, Elvira Nabiullina, the bank appears determined to stay the course in its long-running effort to contain rising inflation. Nabiullina and her colleagues took the rate decision despite a veiled criticism by Putin, who clearly wanted the bank to lower its prime lending rate. He used a bizarre image to drive home the point, warning unnamed officials against subjecting the economy to “excessive cooling like in a cryotherapy chamber.”

Nabiullina’s determination to stick with the freeze reflects the seriousness of the damage that inflation is wreaking on the Russian economy. The official annual inflation rate is hovering just above 10 percent, but the real figure may be even higher. The main culprit for this high price level is clear: The Kremlin has been pumping vast amounts of money into its war against Ukraine. Last year, the Russian government announced that it was raising defense spending to 6.3 percent of GDP—the highest level since the Cold War. Even that number likely doesn’t capture the full magnitude of expenditures. The rise in inflation means, among other things, that the government will find it difficult to spend its way out of a crisis—something sanctions designers should take into account.

So far, this massive wartime stimulus has helped the Russian economy post strong growth figures since sanctions went into effect in 2022. Nabiullina and the other technocrats who manage day-to-day fiscal and monetary affairs have done a remarkable job of keeping things going. Russian ingenuity in evading the sanctions and finding new markets for its ample oil and gas—above all in China and India—has allowed Putin to keep funding the war at high levels.

Now, though, the good times appear to be coming to an end. Even as inflation remains persistent, growth is stalling, falling from 5 percent in 2024 to an annualized rate of around zero at the start of this year, prompting some observers to warn of stagflation. Many businesses struggle with sinking profits and debts they can’t pay back, prompting some managers to predict a wave of corporate bankruptcies. The labor shortage caused by the defense boom has left private businesses starved for workers. Making the shortage worse, deepening xenophobia has led to mass deportations of Central Asian migrant workers—the very sort of low-cost workers Russia desperately needs at the moment.

Most dangerously for the Kremlin, global oil prices are steadily trending downward, mainly the result of the OPEC+ grouping’s decision to surge production. If oil prices stabilize in the range of $60 to $65 per barrel, Russia may avoid the worst, said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. But even then, she added, “large-scale investment and robust growth would remain elusive.” What’s more, the Kremlin has evaded Western sanctions by exporting its oil using a vast fleet of newly purchased tankers operated in ways that make them harder for the West to track. Sanctions experts, who have belatedly built up a comprehensive picture of this so-called shadow fleet, are now working on tactics to target these ships and the ports they operate from—another way in which Russia’s past success also opens up new points of attack.

The Kremlin, in short, is experiencing a moment of acute vulnerability that opens up new opportunities for exerting pressure on Moscow to end the war. Sanctions may not have been as effective as some of their proponents have hoped. But they have indeed caused significant problems for the Russian economy—and new ones could do far more if they are designed to leverage Russia’s weaknesses.

Nicholas Fenton, an associate director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argues that the United States and its allies should seize the moment by embarking on a coordinated campaign to cut Russian exports and encourage capital flight. In November 2024, the West imposed a series of sanctions on several important Russian banks. In a matter of days, the ruble lost 15 percent of its value. The main drawback of the sanctions imposed to date, Fenton said, has been their gradualism—what he calls a “boil the frog” approach. “Acute pressure over a shorter period might give us stronger results than a building pressure over a longer period of time,” he said.

Some of Russia’s most important oil and gas companies remain largely unsanctioned, including megacorporations such as Gazprom, Lukoil, and Rosneft. Freezing these companies’ overseas accounts could take tens of billions of dollars out of play for the Russians, said Nataliia Shapoval, the head of policy research at the Kyiv School of Economics. Imposing secondary sanctions on any companies or individuals doing business with them would make it far harder for Moscow’s oil majors to do business.

And for that matter, why stop at oil? U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham claims to have found widespread support for a Senate bill that would ratchet up sanctions on Russia. According to the Wall Street Journal, Graham wants to impose a 500 percent tariff on goods imported from any country that buys Russian oil, gas, uranium, and other natural resources.

The Trump White House is usually quick to discipline lawmakers who push policies viewed as contrary to the president’s agenda. So far, though, Graham has experienced zero pushback. Is that reason for hope that Trump might be willing to get tough on his friend Putin, despite his latest U-turn on sanctions? If so, this would be the time.

While cozying up to Russia, starting a global trade war, and threatening to annex the United States’ closest neighbor have gotten more attention, among U.S. President Donald Trump’s most consequential actions for the United States’ long term international power has been the assault on science at home. By slashing federal funding for basic research, mounting attacks against universities, and sowing chaos in the visa system for foreign students, Trump has undermined one of the United States’ most important strategic advantages: the best basic research ecosystem in the world, one that drives U.S. commercial innovation and competitive success.

French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a conference at Sorbonne University in early May aimed at attracting U.S. scientists to France. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen gave him an assist, announcing a two-year, 500 million euro ($556 million) effort to support U.S. scientists moving to Europe. It’s a smart start, but Europe should go bigger—much bigger—to take advantage of the Trump administration’s monumental own goal of attacking the U.S. scientific, technical, and broader academic research communities just as global competition around cutting-edge innovation accelerates.

By slashing federal funding for basic research, mounting attacks against universities, and sowing chaos in the visa system for foreign students, Trump has undermined one of the United States’ most important strategic advantages: the best basic research ecosystem in the world, one that drives U.S. commercial innovation and competitive success.

This ecosystem is underwritten by the United States’ ability to attract, develop, and retain a significant share of the world’s top researchers, and it thrives in a country where intellectual property rights and rule of law are upheld, and academic freedom is protected and respected.

The European Union and its member countries—together with the United Kingdom and perhaps Canada—should work together to create a research investment fund with an initially available drawdown of $20 billion to buy U.S. scientific and technological research labs. The fund could be chaired by a former finance minister and advised by small boards made up of private sector and academic leaders connected to specific areas of research—including biotech, artificial intelligence (AI), pharmaceuticals and medical research, and energy—that help make investment decisions. The idea would be to make quick investments at current run rates for lab and research group operations, with similar intellectual property arrangements to their current arrangements with U.S. universities and federal research facilities.

Where practical, the fund could offer to move these labs to European universities or research centers. In some cases, it will make sense for some of the labs to continue working, at least for the time being, in the United States. But these labs can be integrated more fully into the European research landscape over time.

One of the challenges with the initiative announced by von der Leyen this week—in addition to the fact that it needs to be bigger—is that it’s difficult for a single U.S.-based scientist to pick up and move, find another compatible research group across the ocean, and arrange funding. Johns Hopkins University, famous for its medical and public health research, recently announced the layoffs of 2,000 people involved in public health work. Europe should be ready to scoop up that talent in buckets when it comes on the market.

Investments in basic science and research don’t pay dividends in the short term. The consequences of the Trump administration’s attacks won’t be seen in next year’s initial public offerings–they’ll be seen in a less dynamic and innovative U.S. economy 20 years from now. It takes a decade or more for a new discovery to go through testing and development and be brought to market. Over the long run, these investments can lay a foundation for European competitiveness and innovation.

Scientific research labs aren’t the only fount of talent that Europe can harvest at this Trumpian moment. Attracting immigrants from the United States who are likely to found or join start-ups, contribute to European companies, and generally add to the skilled workforce should also be a priority.

Immigration has been crucial to U.S. innovation and economic success. A recent study found that two-thirds of Silicon Valley tech workers are foreign born. The Trump administration’s deportations of lawful permanent residents and student visa holders have made the United States less attractive as a destination for talent. And paired with the attacks on research communities and other actions, they’ve made native talent more open to leaving. After 15 years of having more AI talent coming into the United States than leaving, Semafor recently found that for the first time, inflow and outflow are now about equal. It’s not hard to see the country becoming a net exporter of AI talent in the next 24 months while the competition with China intensifies.

To take advantage of Trump’s actions, the EU should fast-track a new scheme—let’s call it a blue-and-yellow card—that is available to any U.S. citizen or green card holder with a graduate degree and $50,000. Such a card could provide for residency with permission to work until, say, Jan. 20, 2029, with a possible extension for those who are employed on that date. The design and marketing of this scheme are as important as the reality of it—it won’t work if there are too many complicated conditions or bureaucratic rules. The plan has to be something that could be put on a billboard so that Americans seeking to relocate are able to understand quickly that this is a straightforward option. A big, bold offer will get more news coverage, more water cooler and dinner table conversations, and more attention from skilled workers.

Europe could lure many thousands of these workers, who are likely to quickly contribute to European economies and tax receipts. Yes, salaries are lower in Europe, but the quality of life is good, and social safety nets and accessible health care are part of the European offer. Many people are likely to stay for the long run, becoming new Europeans who inject skills, entrepreneurialism, and diversity into the continent’s advanced democracies.

Economic competition in the 21st century and the geopolitical consequences that flow from it will hinge on the marriage of talent and technology. Productivity gains from AI, breakthroughs in medical research, cheaper and more sustainable energy sources, and advanced materials and manufacturing all hold promise for helping people to lead richer, healthier lives. While the United States has struggled to make progress in primary and secondary education over the past half century, its university system—including both the research and the degree granting functions—has remained the most robust in the world.

As Americans grapple with Trump’s fire hose of chaos, Europeans are increasingly clearheaded about the fact that their relationship with the United States has fundamentally changed and cannot easily be rebuilt, no matter what the future brings. In setting themselves up for a new world where the United States is no longer any sort of dependable partner, it would make sense for them to be more aggressive toward their erstwhile ally—and that includes being ruthless about capitalizing on U.S. mistakes.

Trump’s folly can be Europe’s gain, and bold moves by European leaders could make American talent part of a European competitive edge in the coming decades.

Prior to this week’s talks, energy companies based in the United States and a handful of other countries faced a May 27 deadline to exit Venezuela or risk running afoul of U.S. sanctions. In 2022, the Biden administration had granted firms such as Chevron and Repsol licenses to operate in Venezuela under tightly controlled conditions. Upon retaking office in January, U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to reverse the move, giving the companies a few months to leave the country.

This week, U.S. presidential envoy Richard Grenell met with members of Venezuela’s government in Antigua and Barbuda. It was the latest round of negotiations between Washington and Caracas over everything from migration and energy to the future of authoritarian Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s regime.

This week, U.S. presidential envoy Richard Grenell met with members of Venezuela’s government in Antigua and Barbuda. It was the latest round of negotiations between Washington and Caracas over everything from migration and energy to the future of authoritarian Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s regime.

Prior to this week’s talks, energy companies based in the United States and a handful of other countries faced a May 27 deadline to exit Venezuela or risk running afoul of U.S. sanctions. In 2022, the Biden administration had granted firms such as Chevron and Repsol licenses to operate in Venezuela under tightly controlled conditions. Upon retaking office in January, U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to reverse the move, giving the companies a few months to leave the country.

It is not yet clear whether the United States will, in fact, force energy companies out of Venezuela next week. Bloomberg reported that Grenell returned from his Caribbean meeting with a 60-day extension for the oil giants. But Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Wednesday that the deadline stands.

“The pro-Maduro Biden oil license in #Venezuela will expire as scheduled,” he posted on X.

The mixed messages on the extension showcase an apparent tug-of-war in the Trump administration between those who want to negotiate with Maduro, such as Grenell, and those who favor a hard-line approach to the country, such as Rubio. Grenell’s trip suggests that the pro-talks faction is gaining ground. Trump will make the final decision on how to proceed.

If the White House chooses to pursue negotiations, it may correctly realize that the “maximum pressure” approach to Venezuela that Trump promoted during his first term did not serve U.S. objectives. Rather than returning to a strategy based on heavy-handed sanctions, Trump in his second term should preserve existing space for U.S. energy companies in Venezuela while retaining economic leverage over Caracas to incentivize a democratic opening in the country.

There are several signs that Washington and Caracas may quietly be hashing out a deal. In March, the Trump administration published an executive order empowering Rubio to impose a 25 percent tariff on goods from any country that imports Venezuelan oil and gas. But he does not yet appear to have imposed those levies on buyers such as China and Malaysia. Even if Grenell’s promised extension is not borne out, his visit with his Venezuelan counterparts is the strongest indication that negotiations are ongoing—and that an agreement may be in the works.

Grenell’s meeting in Antigua—which also secured the release of American prisoner Joseph St. Clair from Venezuela—is not an isolated incident. Grenell opened up a channel of communication with the Maduro government in January, returning home from a trip to Caracas with six formerly detained Americans in tow.

After the January meeting, the Trump administration announced that Maduro had agreed to begin receiving regular flights of Venezuelan nationals deported from the United States. Following an initial delay, as many as three U.S. deportation flights per week now arrive Venezuela—in some cases, coming directly from the United States rather than via an intermediary nation such as Honduras.

The direct deportation flights are a sign that there is fluid behind-the-scenes communication between Caracas and Washington—and that both countries see value in ongoing negotiations. The last time that the United States announced economic sanctions on Venezuela—when President Joe Biden reimposed previously paused measures in February 2024—Maduro responded by immediately ending his acceptance of deportation flights.

The pro-negotiation camp within the Trump administration may be strengthened by growing evidence that maximum pressure on Venezuela benefits China. Independent energy consultancy IPD Latin America told Foreign Policy that Venezuelan crude output has remained steady through April 2025. Crude exports to China have risen steadily from an average of 277,000 barrels per day in the period from November 2024 to January of this year to an average of 453,000 barrels a day between February and April, according to the group.

Venezuelan crude exports to the Atlantic basin (primarily to the United States) are down from an average of 223,000 barrels per day in March to 113,000 barrels per day in April—and are expected to be just 80,000 barrels a day in May, IPD Latin America said. Since Washington’s threats of secondary tariffs do not seem to have impacted China, growing Chinese demand for Venezuelan oil means Caracas could sustain production even if U.S. sanctions force Western companies to exit the country.

But the clearest signal yet that Trump is interested in pursuing talks with Maduro comes from the administration itself. In addition to Grenell making at least two trips to speak with Venezuelan counterparts, the Trump administration’s solicitor general recently argued before the U.S. Supreme Court that preventing the suspension of temporary protected status for Venezuelan immigrants would interfere with U.S. foreign policy “just as the government is engaged in complex and ongoing negotiations with Venezuela.”

Of course, Rubio’s favored approach can’t be entirely discarded. As the secretary of state and acting national security advisor, he has outsized influence over the direction of U.S. Venezuela policy and will ultimately need to greenlight—or at least tolerate—any changes to U.S. sanctions in the country. If the Trump administration is set on cutting some kind of deal with Venezuela, then Rubio may try to push for clearer democratic concessions from Maduro in talks.

While the details of Grenell’s negotiations remain unclear, the possibility that Western oil companies may not have to exit Venezuela preserves space for the Trump administration to use the offer of U.S. sanctions relief to advance a democratic transition in Venezuela.

As Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a May 11 Fox News interview, Trump wants to “force a change in Venezuela.”

Doing so would not require entirely new thinking. In March 2020, during the first Trump administration, the State Department announced a “democratic transition framework” for Venezuela. The road map promised Caracas graduated sanctions relief in exchange for the creation of a joint transitional government involving both Maduro’s ruling party and the opposition.

The proposal faltered in part because it demanded that Maduro step down and cede executive powers to a multiparty council. Yet the framework’s basic logic—sanctions relief in exchange for concrete, verifiable democratic reforms—remains sound. Trump should dust it off and adapt it to Venezuela’s current reality.

Offers of sanctions relief are the only tool that has achieved progress toward a democratic opening in Caracas. The sanctions waivers that Biden issued for oil companies opened limited space for international investment and ultimately induced Maduro to agree to hold a presidential election on July 28, 2024. He went on to steal that contest precisely because the opposition’s landslide win made the regime’s unpopularity impossible to hide. (Maduro claims to have won the contest, but scans of precinct-level vote tally sheets obtained by opposition activists showed that the opposition presidential candidate won more than twice as many votes as Maduro.)

An updated U.S. democratic accord with Venezuela should build on ideas put forward by the first Trump administration. Washington should insist on genuine power-sharing between Maduro and the opposition in a way that does not force Maduro’s immediate resignation, but rather paves the way for a leadership transition. Any deal should also include the release of all political prisoners, an end to the repression of dissidents, a clear path toward competitive electoral conditions, and the restoration of independent democratic institutions. Phased U.S. sanctions relief would be tied to verifiable benchmarks at every step.

Such a carrots-and-sticks approach could yield benefits not just to Venezuelans, but also to Americans. If Venezuela experiences an economic recovery triggered by targeted sanctions relief, then it would slow the northward flow of Venezuelan migrants at a time when Trump is interested in limiting undocumented immigration. Venezuelan migrants now total nearly 8 million globally, with an estimated 730,000 or more living in the United States.

A deal could also potentially reopen Venezuela’s oil reserves—the largest on the planet—to U.S. energy companies. Their once-strong foothold has been ceded in recent years to shadowy traders and illicit buyers. That has only strengthened the United States’ main adversary: Shut off from the rest of the global economy, Venezuela began to export most of its crude oil to China at a significant discount—which has benefited the Chinese economy.

Securing a new U.S.-Venezuela deal will require time. Trump should use the coming months continue to recalibrate his approach to the country, focusing on democratic reforms. Even if the licenses are not extended next week, a new permit allowing the companies to remain in country and protect their assets would be a signal that negotiations can continue. Doing so could preserve U.S. leverage in political negotiations with Maduro without requiring Washington to withdraw energy companies entirely.

The stakes are high. If negotiations fail and the United States returns to maximum pressure, then China will likely continue to benefit. Beijing remains Venezuela’s key international ally; on May 10, Maduro met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Moscow, where the Chinese leader vowed to “firmly support Venezuela in safeguarding its sovereignty, national dignity and social stability.”

If U.S. policymakers are serious about combating Chinese influence in the Western Hemisphere, then they should not pull U.S. companies out of Venezuela and push Caracas even closer to Beijing. Instead, they should use their limited economic leverage to advocate a gradual, negotiated transition of power in Venezuela—even if it that preserves space for Maduro’s party in the future. Doing so will yield more benefits than another attempt at overnight regime change.

As part of the new global tariff package unveiled on what he called “liberation day,” President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending the long-standing duty-free exemption for low-cost goods from China and Hong Kong. China is the world’s largest textile and garment manufacturer; in 2024, it exported approximately $18.39 billion worth of apparel to the United States, representing about 22 percent of total U.S. apparel imports. The so-called “de minimis” rule had allowed packages under $800 to enter the U.S. without taxes, tariffs, or significant inspection. While the executive order changing the rule has the supposed objective to stem the shipments of synthetic opioids from China to the United States, the exemption has been widely used by fast fashion giants like Shein and Temu to ship cheap e-commerce goods to the U.S. at minimal cost. Packages will now be subject to a tariff rate of 54 percent. As a result, U.S. consumers are likely to see significant price increases on clothing and footwear this year.

The days of a T-shirt costing less than a cup of coffee may be numbered In a move that rattled global fashion supply chains and stock markets in April, the United States slapped sweeping tariffs on textile imports from key manufacturing hubs in Asia. Cambodia saw duties surge to 49 percent, Vietnam 46 percent, Bangladesh 37 percent, and India 27 percent. China was hit with a 145 percent tariff. Although the tariffs have been placed on a 90-day pause, the textile sector faces an additional regulatory blow.

Following the U.S. policy, the European Union this month proposed a €2 flat fee on each small package shipped directly to consumers, mainly targeting low-cost imports from Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein. The fee aims to offset the costs of customs checks and contribute to the EU budget, as over 90 percent of the 4.6 billion packages imported annually come from China.

Meanwhile, other textile and garment manufacturers across South Asia and Southeast Asia are grappling with the unpredictability of shifting tariff regimes, a volatile trade environment, and the question of what happens after Trump’s 90-day pause.. In Bangladesh, where ready-made garments account for over 80 percent of export earnings, the impact is especially severe. The U.S. has imposed a 37 percent reciprocal tariff, up from the previous 15 percent, on Bangladeshi imports, nearly all of which are garments and worth around $8.4 billion annually. If this steep tariff hike is enforced after the grace period, it could jeopardize the livelihoods of over 4 million workers, many of them women, in the country’s largest foreign exchange–earning sector.

These new trade measures are shaking an increasingly fragile system. Ripple effects of the tariffs are exposing deep vulnerabilities in the unsustainable fast fashion model that has dominated global apparel trade for over two decades. Fashion’s low-cost, high-speed engine depends on a seamless, linear supply chain: produce cheap garments in low-income countries; sell and ship them to the West; Western consumers dispose of them after a few wears. Could this disruption be a chance to reimagine and build a more sustainable global textile trade system?

It’s not just the tariffs that threaten the current model. A less abrupt but potentially more transformative environmental policy shift is coming from the European Union, which is sharpening its environmental agenda with a particular eye on textiles. While the EU’s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (adopted in July 2024) does not impose tariffs, it introduces textile-specific rules, including minimum recycled content, durability standards, and requirements for repairability. These requirements could become non-tariff trade barriers for textile exporters, but are not ideological so much as born of necessity.

The global textile industry consumes an estimated 3.25 billion tons of materials annually, with over 99 percent derived from virgin resources, and in addition is responsible for large amounts of water consumption and chemical pollution. Of the vast waste generated, only around 1 percent is currently recycled.

The accumulation of textile waste, much of it from fast fashion that is poorly designed with very short lifecycles, is rapidly emerging as a global environmental crisis. It is not only creating massive uncontrolled waste dumps but also contributing to chemical, microplastic, and greenhouse gas emissions harmful to human health and the environment. The average American throws away over 81.5 pounds of clothing every year, which is an estimated 11 million tons of textile waste. Europeans generated an estimated total of 6.95 million tons of textile waste in 2020—around 35 pounds per person. This textile waste often consists of synthetic materials, which contribute significantly to landfill volumes and take decades or even centuries to decompose.

The California Senate Bill 707—also called the Responsible Textile Recovery Act of 2024—is the first legislation in the United States aimed at holding fashion brands and retailers accountable for the lifecycle of their products. Under this new law—which passed in September 2024—companies are required to implement collection and recycling programs for textiles to prevent them from ending up in landfills. Several countries in the EU, such as France and the Netherlands, have also launched extended producer responsibility (EPR) programs, requiring producers and importers to responsibly manage the end-of-life for fashion products.

These national policies are an important measure, yet the problem goes deeper. Driven by the global fast fashion industry, the growing volumes of textile waste produced combined with increased waste management requirements and landfill costs make disposal in consumer markets costly. As a result, over the past two decades, there have been rapidly growing exports of discarded clothes to secondary markets. Traded textile waste from the United States and Europe, but also China, has become a growing concern of international dimensions. Vast uncontrolled textile dump sites are growing rapidly in multiple countries, including in Chile’s Atacama Desert, Ghana, Kenya, and Pakistan, and are symptoms of wider, systemic problem of the global fashion industry.

About 92 million tonnes of textile waste is produced globally and traded volumes of disposed clothing increased sevenfold over the past decades, growing at a rate of 10 percent per year. The European Union, China, and the United States were the leading exporters, with 30 percent, 16 percent, and 15 percent respectively. And policies as they are currently designed could exacerbate this trade.

With these shipments, it is often challenging to differentiate between textile waste, clothing that can be reused or resold, and garments suitable for recycling, as they frequently appear similar but require distinct sorting processes for proper disposal or repurposing. Further, the trade in used textiles, whether they are secondhand clothes or straight-out waste, transfers the burden of waste management to these secondary markets—many of which lack capacity to properly manage the waste—resulting in significant environmental and human harm.

Shipments of textile waste or unsold low-quality garments to developing countries are often falsely declared as secondhand clothing. Unlike secondhand textiles that hold resale value in local markets, textile waste carries a negative value. The issue of illicit textile waste trade has emerged as a growing concern for the UN Commission on Trade and Development, which is now trying to address it through dedicated policy dialogue. Criminal networks often mix the contents and profits from illegal textile waste trafficking with those earned through the legitimate secondhand textile trade, making it harder to detect. This practice makes illicit textile waste trafficking a highly profitable yet low-risk crime, as enforcement is weak, investigations and prosecutions are infrequent, and penalties for violators tend to be minimal. Criminal networks take advantage of weak oversight, inadequate border enforcement, corrupt officials and regulatory loopholes, and recipient countries lack the infrastructure to handle the influx of low-quality textiles.

Up to 40 percent of Europe’s used textile exports to African countries are waste, according to the European Environment Agency. These problems are complicated by broader issues of illicit or poorly regulated global trade in waste. Between 15 and 30 percent of waste shipments are estimated to be illegal.

According to a report by the Financial Action Task Force (an independent inter-governmental body that develops and promotes policies against money laundering and terrorist financing), the profit generated from illicit waste—not only textiles but also electronic waste and other waste streams—amounts to $10 to 12 billion annually, which puts profits on a par with other major crime areas such as arms trafficking (between $1.7 billion and $3.5 billion in 2020) or illicit trade of protected species ($1.8 billion for animal species and $9.3 billion for plant species).

Addressing these complex challenges will require stricter controls and regulations in both the countries shipping and receiving textile waste. However, current experience shows that, implemented in isolation, domestic policy actions can actually drive illicit trading activities, as these policies can incentivize operators to ship waste out of a country rather than pay official landfill fees. If recipient countries try to introduce unilateral measures to prevent the import of such waste, then the waste flows get diverted elsewhere. This highlights the urgent need for more coordinated global policy action to better regulate the global trade of used and waste textile shipments.

The EU is trying to close the net on waste exports through the new EU waste shipment regulation that entered into force in May 2024. The regulation will ban textile waste shipments to non-OECD countries (unless an exemption is requested). The issue is complicated by trading partners importing the EU’s waste pushing back against the legislation. Traders in used textiles have argued that the stricter rules will limit exports of high-quality textiles, hurting local businesses that resell the clothes on second-hand markets. In Kenya, about 2 million people are employed in this trade. Policies will need to balance supporting the legal second-hand clothing trade—which provides affordable clothing and economic opportunities in developing countries—while cracking down on illegal dumping practices.

Enforcement agencies must pay significantly more attention to ensure policies achieve their intended impact. This is possible: In the United States, prior to the tariffs, the Department of Homeland Security in April 2024 increased the scrutiny on textile imports due to concerns over forced labor in Xinjiang’s apparel sector. The new strategy introduced strengthened enforcement efforts through intensified targeting of small package shipments, joint trade special operations, and increased customs audits and foreign verifications. The same effort and scrutiny will be needed to crack down on illegal textile waste exports, while at the same time enabling traceability of legally shipped textile items.

More systemic policy solutions are needed to go beyond waste trade and address the root causes. For example, textile EPRs that coordinate across jurisdictions and set waste prevention targets as well as measures to reduce the overall volume of new clothes put on the market. Together with eco-design requirements, these policies can help to ensure fashion is designed to be free of toxic chemicals, and has longer use phases and multiple cycles of reuse.

A circular textile economy, in essence, is a question of economics and trade. The linear fashion model has run up against its ecological and geoeconomic limits. As trade routes reconfigure and tariffs and regulatory pressure mounts, companies that once raced to be the fastest may now compete on resilience and circular design. Even if Trump and the EU’s trade measures haven’t killed fast fashion—and it’s far from dead—they have certainly slowed it down, and woven it into a far more tangled and complex policy landscape.

The United States may account for more than half of global stock market capitalization and roughly a quarter of world GDP, but it only produces 9 percent of global good exports and takes in 14 percent of global goods imports. No single country—not even the United States—is a unipolar superpower when it comes to trade in goods, which is where Trump wants to fight his war. A coalition of countries could have more seriously challenged China, but collective action now looks impossible, given the extent to which Trump has alienated Washington’s traditional allies.

Financial markets and U.S. businesses relying on imports have forced U.S. President Donald Trump to significantly climb down from his recent tariff broadside against most of the world but especially Western allies and China. However, he could have extracted more concessions from Beijing if he had pursued a strategy of all against one, rather than one against all.

A coalition of countries could have more seriously challenged China, but collective action now looks impossible, given the extent to which Trump has alienated Washington’s traditional allies.

In 2023, China exported $449 billion in goods to the United States, while it imported only $144 billion in the reverse direction. Given this difference, the same tariff rate would have raised three times more money in the United States than China. Perhaps for this reason, Trump assumed that tariffs would be a lot more painful to China than to the United States. When China raised tariffs on U.S. imports in response to Trump’s trade broadside, he suggested that Chinese President Xi Jinping “panicked” and that the Chinese economy “cannot afford” such a policy.

But a tariff is a tax on a transaction that involves an importer and an exporter. The importer pays the tax, but who ultimately absorbs the extra cost depends on what options each side of the transaction has. Importers are weak if they have few alternative options to source the goods; they would have to absorb the cost of the tariff and pass as much of it as they could to the importing country’s consumers. Exporters are weak when they have few alternative markets for their products, so they would have to lower their prices and absorb the tariff that way.

What matters is each side’s ability to find alternatives to the transaction that is being taxed. The United States would be strong if it exported many products on which China depended yet it did not depend that much on the Chinese market. In this situation, there would be no strategic value for China to impose tariffs, as it would experience significant pain while U.S. exporters could sell their products elsewhere.

We used bilateral trade data covering more than 1,200 product categories to check how extensive the list of products is for which the United States is in a strong position, meaning that (1) a majority of Chinese imports in that category came from the United States, (2) a minority of U.S. exports in the category went to China, and (3) the U.S. export value to China was significant, exceeding $500 million. We found only four product categories that met the criteria, and they were not the most sophisticated: animal feed, miscellaneous nuts, miscellaneous cellulose, and agricultural machinery. Altogether, these exports to China were worth just $2.2 billion in 2023.

The equivalent list of exports that could exert significant pressure on China runs to three categories each for Germany, Japan, and South Korea; four for New Zealand (all agricultural); and one each for France and Australia. Together, these add up to just over $20 billion in export value. Other countries, such as Britain and Canada, have no such products.

Beyond these product categories, there are narrower technological categories for which Washington has attempted to restrict Beijing’s access to Western goods, including the high-end semiconductor chips (and the equipment to manufacture them) that are critical for artificial intelligence applications. China has in part managed to circumvent this restriction by using foreign data centers, developing its own advanced chips, and making machine learning more efficient and thus requiring fewer hardware resources, as evidenced by DeepSeek’s breakthrough AI model.

From this perspective, China’s strategic trade situation could not be more different. The same calculation for Chinese exports to the United States yields 49 product categories worth $88 billion in total, including household appliances, household utensils, mattresses and bedding, sports equipment, toys, and games. In these markets, Trump would inevitably face greater pressure for tariff relief from U.S. importers than from Chinese officials. And that is exactly what happened.

What these numbers make clear is that a unified Western effort could have been much more effective. When we pool the United States together with the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea, the list of products on which China depends grows to 181, worth $396 billion. Each individual country may account for just a fraction of exports, but together they represent a huge portion of the world’s advanced industrial output. These products include a variety of industrial machinery and instrumentation, auto and aircraft parts, and chemical compounds that China’s manufacturing juggernaut vitally depends on. Rather than launching a general tariff war, Western allies could have imposed an embargo on these goods to threaten the Chinese economy.

It can’t be said often enough that the system of Western economic, military, and diplomatic alliances, carefully cultivated by the United States over many decades, has long been a source of strength in times of crisis. Trump was elected twice in part because he was among the first politicians to treat the impact of Chinese trade on American workers as a crisis. In an alternate universe, he may have drawn on the West’s vast collective power to materially change Chinese trade behavior.

Of course, Trump has never really articulated what he actually wants from his trade war. Laudable goals might include halting Chinese intellectual property theft, limiting subsidized dumping practices, and granting more equitable access to Chinese consumer markets. Other Western countries frequently complain about these problems, and Trump would likely have found many sympathetic ears.

To be sure, coordinated trade pressure from Western allies in the past has typically been exerted on countries that are far from essential to global value chains, such as South Africa during apartheid, Iran due to its nuclear ambitions, and Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. China’s magnetic pull toward Western businesses due to its economic heft poses a major hurdle toward unified trade action or other pressure. For example, Volkswagen was notoriously slow to address the ethical implications of operating a joint venture in Xinjiang, where the Chinese state heavily persecutes Uyghurs, including through forced labor. Sufficiently cajoling the Western world into action could realistically only have come from a highly motivated U.S. president.

But Trump squandered this possibility outright by launching an offensive against U.S. allies. Nearly 60 percent of Canadians, for instance, are now actively boycotting imported U.S. products in response to the trade war and Trump’s threats to annex their country. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has declared that the long-standing relationship with the United States “is over,” and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen affirmed that “the West as we knew it no longer exists.”

Moreover, other Western countries are less likely to put pressure on China through trade action when their access to the U.S. market has just been curtailed. On the contrary, they may see an opportunity to eat away at U.S. market share in China to make up the ground they are losing in the United States. For example, China imported $9.6 billion in medical instruments in 2023. Of this total, 37 percent came from the United States, but 15 percent came from Germany, 12 percent from Japan, and 5 percent from the Netherlands. Companies in the latter countries may enjoy a surge in orders if Beijing’s tariffs on U.S. imports hand them a price advantage.

China is thus arguably the biggest geopolitical winner of Trump’s trade wars. Whereas an invasion of Taiwan may previously have entailed paralyzing trade sanctions by a united Western alliance, China now faces a disunited West. Western cohesion will get further eroded as China deepens its economic ties with Western countries now spurned by the United States. If Trump’s goal was to bolster China’s global standing, it is hard to see how he could have been more effective.

El Salvador’s Authoritarian Turn

Authorities in El Salvador detained one of the country’s most prominent human rights lawyers on May 18. The security agents who took Ruth López from her home did not say where she was going or allow her to speak to a lawyer, according to Cristosal, the organization López works for.

López has filed multiple legal complaints against Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s administration, accusing it of misusing COVID-19 pandemic funds and breaking government transparency standards. Hours after her arrest, the country’s attorney general posted on X that López had embezzled government money. López’s mother said that she was “completely innocent” and was being targeted for her work.

“Her arrest appears to be part of increased efforts to silence critics of the Bukele government,” said Juanita Goebertus, the Americas director at Human Rights Watch.

The United Nations expert on judicial independence also voiced concern, writing that López’s case could be part of a “broader pattern of repression against civil society” in El Salvador. Numerous data points support this assertion.

This month, three journalists from El Faro, El Salvador’s most prominent investigative news site, fled the country after the site received what it called credible information that the government was preparing to arrest them. Days earlier, El Faro published a story in which a former gang boss detailed secret deals he said he made with Bukele’s government. Bukele portrays himself as tough on crime.

On May 20, El Salvador’s congress passed a “foreign agents” bill that will implement a 30 percent tax on international donations to nonprofits. It requires increased monitoring of such organizations and potential restrictions on them.

Similar foreign agent laws have been used to stifle dissent in Russia and El Salvador’s authoritarian neighbor, Nicaragua.

Experts argue that El Salvador under Bukele, who took office in 2019, has become emblematic of democratic decline. The Varieties of Democracy research institute classifies the country as an electoral autocracy; according to the organization, El Salvador is second only to Burkina Faso in terms of democratic regression since 2017. (Burkina Faso experienced two military coups during that timeframe.)

Bukele has denied accusations of undemocratic behavior, especially as his administration tries to market El Salvador as a destination for tourists and investors. Andrés Guzmán, the country’s freedom of expression commissioner, told the Washington Post this month that journalists can “say whatever they want, including lies” if they do not commit a crime. (He resigned shortly thereafter, but he praised Bukele.)

U.S. Rep. Gregory Meeks, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, spoke out about López’s detention, posting that the United States should oppose efforts “to weaken the rule of law in El Salvador.”

In the past, Meeks’s efforts might have garnered bipartisan support. Under former U.S. President Joe Biden, both Democrats and Republicans issued statements of concern about human rights violations in Latin America.

But since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January, Republicans have generally remained silent about Bukele’s alleged abuses. The Trump administration is paying Bukele to imprison third-country deportees from the United States in a maximum security prison, which is in violation of a U.S. judge’s order.

“Decades of bipartisan U.S. human rights policies toward Latin America have officially vanished,” former U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States Frank O. Mora wrote this week in Americas Quarterly.

Surveys often identify Bukele as one of the most popular politicians in the region. But a recent poll in El Salvador also found that 65 percent of respondents said that they believed they could face consequences if they expressed political opinions—suggesting that Bukele’s popularity numbers could be inflated.

What We’re Following

Honduras plans to quit coal. At a United Nations climate event in Panama on May 21, Honduras announced that it will phase out all of its unabated coal power plants and cancel a plan for a power station in the northern town of Puente Alto.

The news led climate group Global Energy Monitor to declare Latin America and the Caribbean completely free of active coal plant proposals. Instead, renewable power stations abound, including a geothermal plant under construction in the volcanic island of Dominica. (Argentina and Brazil each have plans to build new coal-fired plants, but both have long been stalled.)

Coal provided only an estimated 4 percent of the region’s electricity in 2024. Still, around one-third of the region’s remaining coal-fired power capacity has no shutdown timeline scheduled, according to Global Energy Monitor.

A person walks by a memorial for Ximena Guzmán, personal secretary to Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada, and José Muñoz, Brugada’s advisor, in Mexico City on May 21.

Killings in Mexico City. On May 20, two top aides to Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada were killed in a close-range shooting in the capital. The killings shocked the city, which is generally spared from Mexico’s worst violence. Though investigators did not immediately announce a suspect, analysts said the nature of the shootings suggested a professional hitman.

The violence was not without precedent. When President Claudia Sheinbaum was Mexico City’s mayor, police chief Omar Harfuch survived an assassination attempt by a cartel that killed two of his bodyguards. Harfuch is now in charge of Sheinbaum’s national security policy.

Sheinbaum has rolled out a more aggressive approach to tackling organized crime than her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. But this week’s events showed that Mexico’s security challenges remain daunting.

Guyanese expressionism. Guyanese visual artist Aubrey Williams is enjoying a revival of interest in London. Williams, who died in 1990, is the subject of a new book and a show at the internationally focused October Gallery, which first exhibited his work in the 1980s.

Williams was a leader of the Caribbean Artists Movement in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. The movement debated questions of Caribbean identity, and Williams was one of its “ideas men,” historian Malachi McIntosh told the Guardian.

Williams created large, abstract, and often expressionist paintings that referenced both nature and Indigenous cultures in the Americas. He was trained as an agronomist before becoming a painter, and much of his work explored the relationship between people and the earth. The October Gallery’s Chili Hawes described Williams as “ahead of his time.”

Guyana marks its Independence Day on May 26.

FP’s Most Read This Week

In Focus: Agriculture Science Prize

Workers harvest soybeans at the Bom Jardim Lagoano farm in Montividiu, Brazil, on Jan. 22, 2024.

Brazilian scientist Mariangela Hungria won this year’s World Food Prize, nicknamed the Nobel of agriculture, on May 12.

Hungria, 67, has worked at Brazil’s state agricultural research company, Embrapa, for decades. Her award-winning research developed a biological—rather than chemical—method to increase crop yields for grains. Specialized seeds and soil treatments that Hungria pioneered allowed plants such as soybeans and corn to absorb more nutrients from bacteria in soil.

Hungria’s work helped Brazil expand its soy production by over 10 times its volume since the 1980s, making it the world’s largest soy producer.

According to a paper that Hungria co-authored, using biological rather than nitrogen fertilizers in Brazil’s soy crops in the 2019-2020 season saved farmers more than $15 billion and reduced carbon dioxide emissions by more than 180 million metric tons.

The vast majority of Brazilian agriculture is still treated with chemical methods, suggesting ample room for the technique to expand.

Innovative techniques to improve food yield will only become more important in a warming world. A Christian Aid report this month estimated that due to climate change, around 60 percent of banana-exporting areas of Latin America and the Caribbean could be unsuitable for producing the fruit by 2080. The region exports more bananas than any other part of the world.

Hungria’s biological method only grew as much as it did in the soy sector due to long-term engagement between scientists and industry, she told CBN, saying, “It’s not enough to have a million solutions on the shelf if they don’t reach the business world.”

However, as the BRICS bloc—which initially included Brazil, Russia, India, and China—gained prominence and added South Africa as a member in 2010, IBSA’s activities waned. Though IBSA foreign ministers still organize a yearly meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, where they regularly call for U.N. Security Council reform, the group’s relevance has plummeted.

In 2003, India, Brazil, and South Africa established what they called the IBSA Dialogue Forum. The trilateral initiative aimed to promote south-south cooperation, reform global governance structures , and amplify the three democracies’ voices on the international stage. In the years that followed, the leaders of IBSA countries organized regular summits to facilitate collaboration across various sectors.

However, as the BRICS bloc—which initially included Brazil, Russia, India, and China—gained prominence and added South Africa as a member in 2010, IBSA’s activities waned. Though IBSA foreign ministers still organize a yearly meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, where they regularly call for U.N. Security Council reform, the group’s relevance has plummeted.

Today, there is a compelling case for revitalizing IBSA after more than a decade of dormancy. There are three reasons why a relaunch would benefit member countries and add a crucial new element to the global order.

First, BRICS has changed fundamentally over the last three years. There are tensions within the group over Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. BRICS also expanded its membership last year. Taken together, these factors risk reducing the group’s agility and ability to address global challenges. They might even strengthen member states that aim to transform BRICS into a Chinese-led bloc that antagonizes the West. IBSA countries, by contrast, have always favored multialignment and are seeing their space within BRICS shrink.

Second, amid the geopolitical uncertainty caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s return to the White House—not all of which is bad news for IBSA countries—it is crucial that India, Brazil, and South Africa deepen their ties beyond the major poles of power.

And third, IBSA countries offer a uniquely valuable perspective in the debate about how to address the major challenges faced by developing democracies around the world. Though India, Brazil, and South Africa are all highly visible on the global stage, their capacity to set the global agenda would increase markedly if they spoke with one voice on specific issues.

From the start, IBSA’s goal was to strengthen emerging powers in the global south. The forum was established following negotiations between Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and South African President Thabo Mbeki during the 2003 G-8 summit in Évian, France. The three leaders were invited to the summit as observers, yet they felt that the invitation was largely symbolic.

“What is the use of being invited for dessert at the banquet of the powerful?” Lula later quipped. “We do not want to participate only to eat the dessert; we want to eat the main course, dessert and then coffee.”

The forum established trilateral working groups focused on areas such as agriculture, environment, defense, and energy, while regular ministerial meetings and presidential summits reinforced the countries’ collaboration. As global power dynamics shifted from a U.S.-led order toward multipolarity, IBSA highlighted the growing influence of emerging powers and the limitations of international institutions in reflecting those countries’ rise.

For example, in its first declaration in 2003, the group called for reorganization of the Security Council to include new permanent members from developing countries. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who took office in 2004, described the grouping as a “strong moral force in today’s unsettled world.”

Even before IBSA’s creation, India, Brazil, and South Africa had collaborated to address the restrictive aspects of the World Trade Organization’s TRIPS agreement on intellectual property rights. Their efforts led to the 2003 TRIPS waiver, which allowed developing nations to export generic medicines during public health emergencies.

Their efforts, including leadership in the G-21 coalition, a bloc of developing countries, significantly improved access to affordable drugs for HIV and AIDS around the world—particularly in Africa—by enabling local production without the consent of patent holders. The debate around the TRIPS waiver became important again during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on a sense that international economic and financial architecture did not serve the interests of developing nations, IBSA countries found success in deepening their limited bilateral relations and establishing a jointly financed—though very small—IBSA fund, in addition to joint naval exercises in a format called IBSAMAR.

Furthermore, the three middle powers created coordinated strategies to enhance their influence within multilateral institutions such as the U.N., World Bank, and International Monetary Fund. They made efforts to align their strategies within the U.N. Human Rights Council, reaffirmed their commitment to universal human rights, and made joint statements on international conflicts, including recently on Gaza and Ukraine.

Yet the initial excitement and flurry largely fizzled out around 2013, when a leaders summit scheduled to take place in New Delhi to commemorate IBSA’s 10th anniversary was canceled. That decision was in large part due to Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s focus on domestic politics, aggravated by a wave of large-scale protests in Brazil in June of that year. Lula, her predecessor, had a more activist international posture.

But the more important factor in making IBSA irrelevant was likely South Africa’s accession to BRICS in 2010—an effort that was led by China. It was probably in Beijing’s interest to sideline a global south platform that it was not part of. So while IBSA preceded BRICS and while Singh famously expressed his preference for IBSA over BRICS—“IBSA has a personality of its own. It is three separate continents, three democracies,” he said—it ended up being BRICS that turned into the most relevant geopolitical platform in the global south.

Today’s profoundly changed geopolitical landscape has created an opportunity for IBSA to resurrect itself.

Though BRICS remains relevant for the foreign-policy strategies of Brazil, India, and South Africa, the grouping has become unwieldy—and its utility is now more limited than it used to be. The war in Ukraine and Russia’s deteriorating ties to the West have created growing tensions between the anti-Western faction in BRICS, led by Russia and China, and a more moderate group committed to preserving ties to the West, led by India and Brazil.

The bloc’s membership expansion in 2024 changed its power distribution. Russia and China pushed for expansion, eventually adding Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and later Indonesia, as full members. A host of so-called partner countries can now also participate in numerous BRICS activities. Reaching consensus among this expanded group is significantly more difficult—as evidenced by the bloc’s failure, for the first time, to develop a joint statement at a foreign ministers meeting in April. Egypt and Ethiopia reportedly objected to including language in favor of Security Council reform, which Brazil, India, and South Africa have long sought.

In some areas, IBSA’s interests diverge significantly from the other established BRICS members. Though Russia, for example, is keen to advance alternatives to the U.S. dollar to circumvent Western sanctions, policymakers in IBSA countries are less interested in moving ahead with the issue, a reluctance potentially aggravated by Trump’s recent threats of punitive tariffs against any country that joins such an initiative.

What’s more, when BRICS was created, China was an emerging power—yet it is now largely seen as a great power. That complicates the bloc’s capacity to speak on behalf of the global south.

Reviving IBSA would provide a forum to push for countries’ shared goals without getting bogged down in increasingly complicated BRICS negotiations. In a world where crafting agreements in large multilateral settings has become difficult, adding a minilateral group such as IBSA to the mix could lead to meaningful cooperation in many areas, such as conflict resolution, the climate crisis, and maritime security.

As China and Russia try to push BRICS into a more anti-Western position, IBSA would allow member countries to articulate a multialigned strategy and preserve strong ties to the West. India has recently moved closer to the United States and is heavily invested in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue; that is more than New Delhi has done operationally with BRICS. Brazil hopes to see the European Union ratify a historic trade deal with Mercosur—a South American trade bloc—has deepened cooperation with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and was designated by Washington in 2019 as a “major non-NATO ally.”

A separate space would also let IBSA governments reinforce their quest for specific reform proposals—including at the Security Council—that other BRICS members are either indifferent about or actively opposed to. At the same time, reviving IBSA does not imply that Brazil, India, and South Africa would move away from BRICS. IBSA would simply be an additional tool.

When IBSA leaders got together for their last official summit in October 2011, being friends with all major global players was easier to achieve than it is today. Russia had not yet annexed Crimea and U.S.-China ties were far rosier than they are now. In the years since, the world has become more unstable, making strategic diversification paramount. Trump’s return to the White House adds a layer of unpredictability. But India and Brazil could, for example, play a supportive role for South Africa as its ties to the United States deteriorate under Trump.

The growing divergence between China and the West offers a unique opportunity for IBSA countries to jointly develop strategies to amplify their ties to Europe and the United States in ways that the BRICS bloc cannot.

Finally, while IBSA’s three democracies represented a majority of BRICS members prior to expansion, democracies are now a minority in the bloc. Establishing a separate space for IBSA would allow India, Brazil, and South Africa to identify common denominators and advance issues that are difficult to discuss in the context of BRICS—including political polarization, disinformation, and internet governance.

One example of shrinking space for democracies within BRICS is the decreasing relevance of the BRICS Academic Forum, which used to be intellectually vibrant but now provides very limited space to discuss sensitive issues or openly disagree with member states’ policies. In short, it has largely ceased to be a platform of genuine debate. A comparable structure for scholars from IBSA countries would provide a far freer environment for genuine deliberation.

On first impression I thought Brzezinski’s non-answer was boastful. But in retrospect, Zbig (as he was known) was just being honest. The Polish-born strategist, most famous as Jimmy Carter’s national security advisor, evaded easy categorization. He was the Democrats’ Cold War sage who found admirers on Ronald Reagan’s foreign policy team; an inveterate Russia hawk who was an arch-nemesis of neoconservatism in the George W. Bush years; and an early backer of Barack Obama.

Once, while shuttling between meetings in steamy Beijing during the summer of 2010, I asked Zbigniew Brzezinski who his single biggest foreign policy influence was. I was the great man’s research assistant back then and was awkwardly looking to fill the time. He paused for a moment, looking almost puzzled. “Nobody, really,” he answered.

Brzezinski is often compared to his contemporary and rival, Henry Kissinger. They were both European émigrés with thick accents and shared a professional path of star-academic-turned-national-security-advisor. But the two approached U.S. strategy from completely different perspectives. Kissinger, a German-born scholar of old-world European diplomacy, held a pessimistic view of the trajectory of the United States and inflated view of the USSR, seeking a balance of power between them through detente. Brzezinski, a scholar of the ideological and political weaknesses of the Soviet Union, bore a grudge against Moscow for the enslavement of Eastern Europe and had inherent confidence that the United States would prevail in the Cold War.

Brzezinski’s remarkable life is crisply retold by Financial Times columnist Edward Luce in his magnificent new biography, Zbig: The Life of Zbigniew Brzezinski, America’s Great Power Prophet. Luce’s book is the first real attempt to capture the full dimensions of Brzezinski as both a thinker and also a man: his acid wit, his preternatural competitiveness, his comical tight-fistedness, his tender and unbending dedication to his family. Luce does this beautifully in an essential new contribution that properly elevates Brzezinski’s standing in the pantheon of U.S. foreign policy thinkers.

Luce’s book leaves many impressions, but chief among them is that the United States no longer produces many grand strategists like Brzezinski or Kissinger. Some of this may be due to the uniqueness of their generation, which matured in the wake of World War II’s destruction and produced thinkers fixated on problems of world order. But perhaps more has to do with the requirements of success in U.S. foreign policymaking nowadays. The leviathan of the modern-day national security state and even the National Security Council itself—which has grown from a few dozen in Brzezinski’s time to hundreds today—increasingly demands as much operational expertise as strategic depth. At a time of immense global transition, this geostrategist deficit is unfortunate; as Kissinger wrote on the news of his rival’s passing in 2017, “The world is an emptier place without Zbig pushing the limits of his insights.”

Brzezinski was the son of a Polish diplomat, and though he only lived in Poland on and off through his first decade, the country and its tragic history loomed large over Brzezinski’s life. While coming of age in 1940s Montreal, little Zbig dreamed of Polish knights and heroes; his precocious essays in high school focused on the Polish problem in international relations.

As the Iron Curtain descended over Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe, Brzezinski channeled his prodigious talents toward studying his adversary. He learned Russian and earned a PhD from Harvard in 1953 in the nascent field of Sovietology. Zbig’s 1960 book, The Soviet Bloc: Unity and Conflict, based off of his master’s thesis, was both prescient and enduring: He argued that the Soviet Bloc’s centrifugal nationalities, and even the USSR’s own national patchwork (from Balts to Ukrainians), created an Achilles’ heel that would ultimately be its undoing. In response to claims—popular during the Cold War—that Moscow had successfully created a sense of pan-Soviet citizenship, Brzezinski would often retort: “So do they speak Soviet?”

As a professor at Harvard and then Columbia, Brzezinski’s energies increasingly turned toward Washington. During a brief tour at the State Department during Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration, he advocated for peaceful engagement with Eastern Europe to pull it apart from Moscow. But it was Brzezinski’s turn as national security advisor that put him in the cockpit of U.S. foreign policy. Zbig’s chief rival within the Carter administration, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, favored stabilizing relations with the USSR, whereas Brzezinski saw detente as a one-sided bargain. In the internal struggle for influence, he ate Vance for lunch, decisively winning Carter’s ear. Part of this was due to Brzezinski’s proximity in the White House, but Zbig was also a wellspring of new ideas and entertaining company. Once, when Carter asked for a capsule history of the USSR, Brzezinski responded that, under Lenin, it “had been like a revival meeting; under Stalin it was like a prison; under Khrushchev it was a circus; and under Brezhnev it resembled a United States Post Office.”

Brzezinski used his influence to bury the knife into a faltering detente. Building on Nixon and Kissinger’s opening to China, Carter fully normalized relations with Beijing in 1979. This was all Zbig: He established a deeply trusting relationship with the diminutive Deng Xiaoping based on mutual antipathy toward Moscow. At a dinner at Brzezinski’s home in Virgina to help seal the deal, they giddily toasted to U.S.-China friendship with Leonid Brezhnev’s favorite vodka. Kissinger had argued that the opening to China created an elegant “strategic triangle” that would bring the United States closer to both Moscow and Beijing. Brzezinski instead operationalized U.S.-China relations against the USSR. With China’s help, the Carter administration aided the Afghan resistance when the USSR invaded on Christmas Day 1979, sinking the Soviet Union into an enduring quagmire that accelerated its demise.

Brzezinski also encouraged Carter’s advocacy for human rights as a way to put the Soviets on the ideological defensive, to the howls of those at State who wanted to preserve a working relationship with Moscow. In this pursuit Brzezinski found a fortuitous partner in fellow Pole Pope John Paul II, a critical historical relationship recalled vividly by Luce, who includes touching correspondences between the strategist and pope.

But it was Iran that permanently injured Brzezinski’s legacy. Ironically, Zbig was prescient about the dangers of the 1979 Iranian revolution. He saw shades of 1917 Russia, while others, like U.S. Ambassador William Sullivan, saw Ayatollah Khomeini as a potential “Gandhi-like” figure. But Zbig will be forever associated with Operation Eagle Claw—the high-risk raid to rescue American hostages in Tehran, which he advocated for and which failed disastrously, sealing Carter’s electoral fate.

Brzezinski was also unduly paranoid about a Soviet hand behind events in Iran. In Kai Bird’s magisterial biography of Carter, The Outlier, Brzezinski is depicted as a reckless superhawk, with a tendency toward “geostrategic gobbledygook” (as Strobe Talbott once put it in Time) and seeing a Soviet shadow around every corner. There’s a grain of truth to this caricature. Zbig was the author of the 1980 Carter Doctrine, which promised that the United States would block any attempt to control the Persian Gulf by an “outside force” (read: Moscow). In retrospect, the threat of Soviet expansion into the region was wildly overblown, as the USSR sputtered into terminal decline.

The fall of the Iron Curtain nine years later fulfilled Brzezinski’s boyhood and professional dreams. Brzezinski had predicted the impending collapse of communism only months earlier, arguing forcefully in his 1989 book, The Grand Failure, that Gorbachev’s reform efforts were doomed. “[It’s] hard to imagine an individual more vindicated by the actual course of historical events” than Brzezinski, wrote Francis Fukuyama. The Soviet Union then dissolved into its constituent nationalities, just as Zbig foresaw in his master’s thesis four decades earlier.

Luce astutely notes that Brzezinski was optimistic about U.S. capabilities during the Cold War yet turned cynical about the ability of the United States to shoulder the mantle of global leadership afterward. Zbig regretted George H. W. Bush’s inability to flesh out a vision for a “new world order” beyond sloganeering and criticized Bill Clinton’s administration for failing to make permanent peace between Israel and Palestine. To his immense credit, Brzezinski was an immediate and trenchant critic of George W. Bush’s Iraq War and dismissed the Global War on Terror as a “quasi-theological” absurdity.

On Russia, which Zbig knew so well, he was characteristically prophetic. Brzezinski predicted that the post-Soviet Russian Federation would soon be captured by revanchism, and advocated for an eastward expansion of NATO to consolidate the West’s gains. In this prophecy, Brzezinski trained his focus on the centrality of Ukraine. He wrote in 1994 that “without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an empire, but with Ukraine suborned and then subordinated, Russia automatically becomes an empire.” How right he proved to be.

What makes a good strategic thinker? Historical perspective, an ability to intuit political will, and a synthesis of disciplines—from military affairs to human psychology. Brzezinski brilliantly exhibited all of these qualities. His theories pulled together diverse strands of politics, ideology, and societal development, all communicated in an incisive though academic style, epitomized in titles such as Between Two Ages: America’s Role in the Technetronic Era, his 1970 book.

An often underappreciated trait of a good strategist is originality of thought, which Zbig protectively nurtured. Brzezinski wouldn’t be caught dead purveying Washington groupthink; he intentionally refrained from reading opinion essays on subjects on which he was writing or giving a major speech, to avoid unwelcome influence. As his research assistant, I compiled weekly briefs of international newspapers so that he could better inhabit and understand foreign points of view.

Also essential is intellectual fearlessness, which often comes with sharp elbows. Brzezinski could be quite charming, and his commitment to his family over the Georgetown social circuit set him apart from many of his peers. But his hawk-like facial features betrayed his sense of mission and no-nonsense approach to things. He cunningly outflanked his rivals at the State Department and elsewhere—and even reveled in it: He once boasted to me about a book on the Carter years in which his portrayal “made Machiavelli look like a boy scout.”

But Brzezinski’s most Machiavellian maneuvering was deployed in the pursuit of ideas, rather than power for power’s sake. According to Luce, in the Johnson administration Zbig likely invented a story about an upcoming speech by Robert F. Kennedy attacking Johnson’s Cold War policies, prompting the president to preempt his rival with a speech containing Brzezinski’s preferred strategy toward Eastern Europe. Brzezinski of course enjoyed popularity and press, but popularity was always secondary to advocating what he thought was right. Zbig’s early and forceful calls for a two-state solution and against the Iraq War ostracized him in many corners of Washington, but he never relented.

The requirements of leadership in U.S. foreign policy have fundamentally changed from Brzezinski’s heyday and make Zbig-like geostrategists more elusive than ever. Brzezinski ran his NSC like a college seminar: 20 or so staffers, each covering a different region, seated around a single table. But today’s national security bureaucracy is so massive, so complex, that deep geostrategic thinking is nice-to-have but insufficient. To handle the sheer flow of material and address cross-cutting economic and national security challenges requires a skillset and attitude that would have been alien to Brzezinski. Gone, too, are the international relations scholar-celebrities—academies, more atomized and specialized than ever, don’t produce them, and the public doesn’t value them as its attention turns inward.

Toward the end of his life, Brzezinski constantly lamented Americans’ ignorance of foreign affairs. He thickened his speeches with anecdotes about how, for example, a third of U.S. high schoolers couldn’t identify the Pacific Ocean on a map. In this way, Brzezinski followed a grand tradition of international relations thinkers like George Kennan who griped about the materialism and superficiality of the U.S. public, to the point of sounding fuddy-duddy. But as the United States now retreats from old alliances and finds itself captured by nativism and populism, perhaps, on this score, Brzezinski was prophetic yet again.

In recent years, if blog posts from inside the beltway are to be believed, there is a growing sentiment among hawkish conservatives that the way to achieve the aims of the United States is to “ do Sicario .” Far be it from me to suggest that President Donald Trump is getting his ideas from crime thrillers with byzantine scripts and moody cinematography. (Is there any evidence to suggest he has the attention span to watch anything longer than an episode of The Apprentice?) But puzzling over the current administration’s weaponization of its hazily defined immigration policy—resulting in the headline-grabbing cases of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and Mahmoud Khalil —brings to mind a line from Sicario’s ruthless CIA man, Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), when he’s pressed to explain his true aims: “Shake the tree and create chaos .”

On one level, the Taylor Sheridan-written Sicario movies exist solely to answer the question, “What would it look like if Benicio del Toro was a merciless, hyper-violent, highly skilled assassin?” (The answer is: terrifying, but, if you can remind yourself that it’s just a movie, awesome.) However, one could also approach these films as a thought experiment: How could the U.S. government exploit chaos at the border for nefarious gains?

Sicario (Spanish for “hitman”) made its debut at the esteemed Cannes Film Festival in 2015, the first of Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve’s projects to compete in the main slate. Though he had a hit two years prior with his first English-language film, the crime thriller Prisoners, the sinister Sicario was the one that launched him to elite status with cinephiles who place a premium on technical acuity and determined formalism. (This is a polite way of saying “film bros.”) The second shot in Sicario is of dust randomly whipping through a shaft of light, a recurring image that likely has symbolic meaning, but also may be there simply because it looks cool.

It was also the first screenplay written by then-45-year-old Sheridan, an actor of modest success who—with the series Yellowstone and its myriad spin-offs—has now developed into one of the biggest writer-producers in Hollywood. Sheridan is also unusual in the entertainment industry for straying from typical liberal talking points. (Behold a visit to Joe Rogan’s podcast to bemoan the death of masculinity.) While he has never voiced full-on support for Trump, he did walk back a 2017 pro-impeachment comment when speaking to press in 2022. While Commentary magazine has hailed him as an “Anti-Woke King, more nuanced critics conclude that the politics of his flagship series seem to be deliberately chaotic.

If you are getting a bit of a “male energy” vibe from all this, it may come as a surprise to learn that Sicario’s protagonist is a woman. It’s through the eyes and ears of FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) that we slowly uncover the ruthless machinations of a CIA operation that appears to have approval going all the way to the top.

We meet Macer, whose focus is retrieving missing persons, while she and her team move in on a safe house in Arizona run by the Sonora Cartel. In the most eerie way possible, she discovers a collection of dead bodies vacuum-sealed inside the walls. (The place is also booby trapped for added punctuation.)

Though who, precisely, the dead people are remains a little vague, CNN headlines about a “house of horrors” are enough to trigger a tense meeting in a soundproof room with a lot of stern-looking men. In addition to Macer’s boss, who vouches for her, there’s Brolin’s Graver, a mercurial, charismatic man who obviously rarely tells the truth.

On paper, Graver is from the Department of Defense, and he wants Macer to join an interdepartmental task force that seems to answer to nobody but has a limitless budget. We will later learn that, naturally, he’s CIA, but he needs someone on the team from the FBI in order to get approval for operations on this side of the U.S.-Mexico border. This sounds like a bit of a screenwriting cheat to me, but many a movie classic is rife with them. You think the Nazis would really care about “letters of transit” signed by Charles De Gaulle to get people out of Casablanca? (Roger Ebert lovingly railed about this at length in a Casablanca commentary track years ago.)

The other key member on the team is Benecio del Toro’s tight-lipped Alejandro, who moves like a shadow and is clearly haunted by demons. (He twitches as he snoozes aboard a private jet.) What we’ll learn is that when things get too hairy even for Graver or his Delta Force guys, Alejandro steps in, either for executions or “information extractions.” (That he whistles “Hail to the Chief” before stepping into a harshly lit interrogation chamber is not the movie’s most subtle moment.) Who he is and where he comes from is one of the central mysteries of the film.

So what is this team doing? Sicario is slow to reveal its true intention, keen to stay focused on its fetishistic look at high-powered weapons and drone surveillance footage. (There are many “Earth from above” shots that revel in the Mexican landscape.) The cartel has its inside man, Manuel, somewhere in the U.S., and Macer (and we) are led to believe that by extracting Manuel’s brother Guillermo from Mexico and bringing him back to the U.S., it will smoke out his location, and this could maybe lead us to the cartel’s big boss.

Villeneuve, with cinematographer Roger Deakins, editor Joe Walker, and composer Johan Johannsson amp up the tension during step one of the operation, giving the whole sequence a “plunge into the abyss” feel. I would not be the first critic to compare the first incursion south of the border to Apocalypse Now, though instead of a river through the jungle, it’s a pocked road through urban decay, decorated with the strung-up corpses of those who dared disobey the cartel. The mayor of Ciudad Juárez, where much of the action takes place, was understandably less than pleased with the production; he called for a boycott, and considered suing for defamation.

With the brother in U.S. hands—and by deploying Alejandro’s methods—we learn about corrupt police on both sides of the border and a smuggling tunnel between Sonora and Arizona. (Tunnels like this have been found in reality, so this isn’t exclusively right-wing paranoia.) Eventually, we learn the truth about Alejandro. He was once an idealistic prosecutor in Mexico whose wife and daughter were murdered by the cartels. He has hardened his heart and channeled his rage into becoming a remorseless killing machine, caring only about vengeance. And who has set him loose? Not just the CIA, but the Medellín cartel in Colombia.

Huh? Well, that’s the twist to Sicario. The U.S. figures it is better to pick off the Mexican cartels one by one, then work with a single group that can control the entire flow of narcotics. Maybe the Colombians are offering a better percentage of the deal; that aspect is left to the imagination. Kate Macer, representing the audience, is left to shake her head but ultimately shrug it off, as if to say, it’s a dirty business, but maybe it’s for the best?

How this enterprise is progressing isn’t really revealed in Sicario: Day of the Soldado, the 2018 sequel. Comparing the first and second films on a cinematic level is interesting. The first movie is much more cerebral, the second is absolutely action-packed—and gory and gross. Sheridan once again wrote it, but Villeneuve stepped out as director, replaced by Stefano Sollima, best known for the Italian mafia series Gomorrah. (Villeneuve moved on to direct Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, and the Dune films.) Though it had a slightly larger budget, Day of the Soldado doesn’t look anywhere near as good as the original, so maybe the film bros have a point about Villeneuve and cinematographer Deakins (also absent) having a kind of magic touch.

Emily Blunt’s Kate Macer also didn’t return for the sequel. While there is a replacement female character—Catherine Keener as Graver’s boss at the CIA—she does not come equipped with a moral compass (however dormant) like Macer had.

Day of the Soldado’s instigating event is even more of a Fox News talking point than corpses in walls: The flow of migrants over the border is used as cover for fundamentalist Muslims who want to blow up American supermarkets.

As such, the president (never seen, though Matthew Modine appears as an astringent secretary of defense) declares that cartels have been added to the list of terrorist organizations, something the Trump administration did in January.

While the cartels are shown profiting off the flow of migrants in Day of the Soldado, it remains vague just how connected they truly are to the Islamic State-like groups depicted in the prologue.

Though it didn’t seem as if there were many in the first movie, Graver assures Alejandro that there are “no rules this time.” Destabilizing individual cartels one by one is taking too long. Graver and Alejandro’s objective is to start a major civil war throughout Mexico, and they plan to do it through a series of false flag operations.

They begin by kidnapping the daughter of a cartel head, bringing her to the United States, then having U.S. police “rescue her.” One problem: Try outsmarting a teenager! She figures out the ruse just as moles in the Mexican police force turn on our CIA operatives, leading to the first of many bloody shoot-em-ups. There are more twists and turns, leading to a pretty juicy lead-in for a third Sicario movie that is allegedly happening, though there have been delays.

The first Sicario was not a runaway box office smash, but it did very well with critics—achieving a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes (a deeply flawed but still useful metric). Most reviews recognized it as a cut above the usual FBI drama, and there were three Academy Award nominations, though not for its writing, directing, or performances. (They were for cinematography, sound editing, and original score.) The more rough and rowdy sequel was reviewed a little more harshly, with some critics suggesting the series had gone from bleak to outwardly xenophobic. (Even the typically conservative New York Post called it “nasty.”)

What does any of this have to do with the Trump administration? The president has been labeling those who cross the Mexican border violent criminals since he announced his candidacy at Trump Tower in 2015, about a month after Sicario’s Cannes debut. Rewatching the movies now, I found myself thinking about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongly deported as part of Trump’s promise to get “tough” on the border; a promise that, from my perspective, appears to care little about taking extreme, even illegal action, so long as that action sends a message. “Shake the tree and create chaos.”

Labelling the cartels as terrorists, as is done in Day of the Soldado, reminded me a bit of the official excuse for yanking Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil and whisking him to an ICE detention center in Louisiana. To me, it feels like the government is relying on technicalities to make some bold moves, bringing us one step closer to the world depicted in these movies. While Khalil was indeed a leader of campus protests that were undoubtedly critical of U.S. policy (a protected First Amendment activity that a Green Card holder like him is allowed to undertake), the White House initially suggested that that either he or his organization distributed Hamas propaganda during one of the direct actions, figuring they could nail him on this because Hamas is listed as a terrorist organization. The specific charges have deviated, however, as the case has lingered.

What I find most interesting about the Sicario films is how they differentiate from the paranoid thrillers of 50 years ago like The Parallax View or Three Days of the Condor. Whereas those movies were warnings about the spread of U.S. imperialism, the tone in Sicario is a bit “harsh, but necessary,” and downright, “This is a little bit badass, isn’t it?” in Day of the Soldado. It’s an undeniable vibe shift and has me worried about the trilogy’s potential finale.

The conference, and the pledge, was one of the first prominent public moves for Prince Rahim, who inherited the Aga Khan title from his father, Prince Karim Aga Khan IV , who died on Feb. 4. The fourth Aga Khan served as leader of the Nizari Ismaili—or simply Ismaili—community, the second-largest branch of Shiite Muslims, since 1957. As Aga Khan IV’s eldest son, Prince Rahim now leads an estimated 12 to 15 million Ismaili Muslims across more than 35 countries.

When international delegations attended the European Commission’s conference on Syria on March 17, Prince Rahim Al-Hussaini, or Aga Khan V, attended alongside them. Addressing the conference, he reiterated his community’s more than millennium-long history in Syria and recommitted the Ismaili Imamat and its development arm, the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), to “ongoing and permanent support for the Syrian people” and a “determination to help foster peace, hope, and development for a better future.”

Considered a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, the Aga Khan is, first and foremost, a religious leader. But over the last 100 years, the role has also been a consistent, and significant, presence in global affairs.

Though under 1 percent of the global Muslim population, Ismailis have wielded substantial political authority and remain an intellectually influential minority, religion professor Khalil Andani told Foreign Policy. Referencing the famed Iranian American scholar Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Andani said “there is hardly an aspect of Islam, especially in its earlier development, which was not influenced in one way or another by Ismailism.” Shiites, around 10 percent of the global Muslim population, maintain that the Prophet Muhammad’s family are Islamic tradition’s sole, genuine interpreters. Ismailis look to a particular 1,400-year succession line to establish and legitimize imams, whom they rely on for spiritual guidance as divinely appointed leaders. The title of Aga Khan, “chief of chiefs” or “chief commander,” was granted to the 46th hereditary imam Prince Hasan Ali Shah, by the shah of Persia in 1817. As Aga Khan, the imam is seen as the absolute authority governing Islamic beliefs, practice, and ethics for his murids—oath-bound followers—and matters related to their tithes, marriages, divorces, and community leadership. The first Aga Khan received the title from the Shah of Persia in the early 19th century, before being appointed governor of Iran’s Kerman province. His influence expanded in conjunction with the British to Afghanistan and Pakistan’s Sindh province. In 1866, the British Raj, having already relied on the Aga Khan’s services in Sindh’s annexation in 1843 and noted his influence and charismatic influence among the Khojas in then-Bombay, India, established his authority in the “Aga Khan case.” The first Aga Khan’s eldest son, Aqa Ali Shah, became Aga Khan II. A member of the Iranian royal family by marriage, he maintained close ties with the British colonial government and became a significant leader for Muslims across the Indian subcontinent.

Then, in 1885, at the age of 7, Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah inherited the imamat from his father and became Aga Khan III. Later studying at prestigious British institutions, he effortlessly moved through circles of royalty, intellectuals, and the global elite, having also married into Europe’s privileged classes. Once described as a Muslim pope, Aga Khan III helped found the All-India Muslim League political party in 1906 to advance the interests and protection of British India’s 80 million Muslims. He served as its first president until 1912, and in 1932, he represented India at the League of Nations and became president of its 18th assembly from 1937 to 1938.

Aga Khan III also developed a reputation as a simultaneous spiritual leader, pleasure seeker, and political luminary belonging to no person or nation, a personage he passed on to his grandson and successor, Aga Khan IV. A similarly transnational figure, Aga Khan IV was a jet setter who influenced global politics until his death. Along the way, he developed a reputation as an international playboy, leading a lavish lifestyle that included ownership of a nearly $25 million super-yacht and a private island in the Bahamas.

A grid of four black-and-white historic photos shows the Aga Khan IV in the first photo bowing his head in traditional white clothing seated next to his wife, in the second photo fastening a ski on a ski slope, in the third in formal wear next to a blonde woman, and in the fourth looking through binoculars and smiling.

The family’s wealth is estimated somewhere between $800 million and $13 billion, sourced from inherited funds, real estate and tourism investments, and a widely known horse-breeding business. The Ismaili Imamat insists that the Aga Khan’s personal wealth is not derived from zakat (the religious obligation to donate to charity) from its worldwide membership. While zakat is one of the five pillars of Muslim faith, encouraging the donation of 2.5 percent of one’s annual net worth, Ismailis give what they call a dasond, meaning one-tenth, which is between 10 to 12.5 percent of their net income. These contributions, the imamat maintains, are used exclusively for the community’s needs, investments, and expenses.

The fourth Aga Khan also used his money and influence for his community’s benefit, even if his role was less overtly political compared to prior Aga Khans, according to Andani. The late Aga Khan IV articulated his mandate as extending beyond the community’s spiritual welfare to its physical well-being and security, becoming one of the world’s leaders in development, educational, and health care philanthropy. This was largely under the auspices of the AKDN, which deals with a wide range of development issues. The network’s expansive reach includes hospitals, farming initiatives, schools, clinics, museums, centers, and Aga Khan Universities.

The AKDN employs 96,000 people to provide services through 1,000 programs and services in more than 30 countries. Despite the Aga Khan’s official apolitical stance, his soft power is immense.

Shariq Siddiqui, director of the Muslim Philanthropy Initiative at Indiana University in Indianapolis, said the Aga Khan’s far-reaching resources foster a certain kind of presence. “All philanthropy is a form of influence, right?” Siddiqui said. “When you want to make the world a better place, you use your resources to help and show that you care, that you are an instrument of good within the larger society.”

To that end, the Aga Khan is one of few leaders without territorial rule who is afforded state honors. And the Ismaili Imamat—as an institution—has been recognized as a legal personality in several countries. The role is “a quiet, very practical form of diplomacy,” Andani said.

What sets the AKDN apart, perhaps, is its ability to harness and channel its wealth paid by Ismailis across the globe toward a centralized, systematic force, enabling the AKDN to put Islamic practice to use in the neoliberal world order, Siddiqui said.

Ancient faith combined with contemporary zeitgeist is central to current Ismaili influence and why the Aga Khan is invited to contribute in word and deed to nations’ development. According to Canadian scholar Mohammad N. Miraly’s book Faith and World: Contemporary Ismaili Social and Political Thought, contemporary Ismaili philosophy can frame liberal values like democracy, pluralism, philanthropy, and education as contemporary expressions of their interpretation of eternal Quranic principles and the binding teachings of Shiite imams. Throughout his nearly seven decades of leadership, Aga Khan IV frequently articulated the principles of liberal democratic pluralism as the best means to realize his dual mandate to improve the spiritual and material lives of his followers and their societies.

Additionally, Aga Khan IV believed institutionalizing modern liberal values within the imamat and through the AKDN was part and parcel of ethical Islamic living in the 20th and 21st centuries. Frequently, he reiterated how the “cosmopolitan ethic” of Islam guided his activities. As such, the AKDN became an practical, institutional vehicle to make manifest Ismailis’ beliefs and Islam’s fundamental ethics, as espoused in its ethical framework: compassion, generosity, inclusiveness, sound mind, knowledge, and discovery. Consequently, the Aga Khan frequently bemoaned the rise of extremism and intolerance and worked to encourage pluralism through the establishment the Global Centre for Pluralism in Ottawa, Ontario, in 2017.

Even so, the Aga Khan and AKDN works with people from multiple backgrounds to ensure the safety of Ismailis and their communities, said Ayso Milikbekov, who has worked in development with the AKDN in Kenya and Central Asia. “Democratic or authoritarian governments and nations, it doesn’t matter,” he told Foreign Policy. For example, the AKDN was one of the few international organizations that kept its operations going after the Taliban regained power in Afghanistan in 2021. Ismailis are a small minority in the country and the AKDN has invested millions in large-scale rural development since 2002. “The goal is to find and promote peace,” said Milikbekov. “Then you can approach other matters of extremism, economics, politics, culture, etc.”

In Tajikistan, where civil war broke out in 1992 after the mainly Ismaili population of the Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous region declared independence, the Aga Khan provided food and aid, wielding his authority and resources to help end the conflict.

As Georgetown scholar Shenila Khoja-Moolji’s research shows, the Aga Khan’s leadership inspires Ismailis the world over to rebuild their lives and communities following displacement, forced migration, and persecution. Altogether, this can make the Aga Khan a bit of a curiosity at a time when religion and religious people can be sidelined as conservative forces leading toward intolerance, rather than working for the “secular” good.

At the same time, the modern globalized context and its concomitant liberal state apparatus seem to provide prime space for Ismailism’s particular interpretation of Islam, leading to what anthropologist Jonah Steinberg called its “phoenix-like renaissance” over the last 100 years. For example, in Canada, where nearly 80,000 Ismailis live, the religion has thrived, and members represent the most elite levels of business, culture, and politics. In 2008, the Aga Khan established a Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat, a de facto embassy in the Canadian capital. In 2009, he became the fifth person to gain honorary Canadian citizenship.

Roman aristocrats, like all ancient elites, almost universally disliked trade and held the merchants who made it possible in contempt . Trade was seen as a sordid , cheating sort of thing (the theory of comparative advantage that explained how a merchant produced value honestly would not be developed until 1776 ) whereby merchants could gain wealth outside of the proper ways of being born rich or capturing wealth in war. Worse yet, trade generated wealth outside of the direct control of the landholding elites who dominated politics in nearly every ancient society.

The second Trump administration has embarked on a set of broadly anti-trade tariff policies that are threatening the foundations of Pax Americana, the post-World War II global order that ensured U.S. dominance, growing prosperity in much of the world, and relative global peace. If the United States-led order falls, it would not be the first such system whose decline could be partly attributed to short-sighted political decisions that reduced trade.

Worse yet, trade generated wealth outside of the direct control of the landholding elites who dominated politics in nearly every ancient society.

Yet the Roman Empire benefited greatly from expanding Mediterranean trade between the third century B.C.E. to the third century C.E. Roman policy encouraged trade and the economic growth it created lined Roman coffers too, at least until the Romans themselves fragmented the pan-Mediterranean trade zone they had created, impoverishing their empire and leaving it less able to face the challenges that would eventually lead to its fragmentation and dissolution in the West.

The Romans had the good fortune to expand into a Mediterranean world already experiencing a substantial expansion of trade, particularly seaborne trade. Shipwrecks, often datable by the cargo they deposited on the Mediterranean sea floor, can provide a guide to the amount of overall sea trade, since the number of shipwrecks will correlate, at least roughly, with the number of ships plying the waves.

To judge by the rate at which dateable shipwrecks appear in the archaeological record, by 500 B.C.E., Mediterranean shipping was already around 10 times what it had been in the ninth century B.C.E. and equally roughly 10 times what it would be in the ninth century C.E.

However, the expansion of the Roman Republic coincides with an enormous burst of trade activity: Dateable shipwrecks leap from between 20 and 40 per half-century between 500 and 200 B.C.E. to well over a hundred between 150 B.C.E. and 100 A.D. That boom in seaborne trade is reflected not only in shipwrecks but also in land-based evidence for trade, like ceramic containers which can be traced to distant points of origin, and persists well into the imperial period.

Moreover, we know that not only were there more ships plying the trade lanes, they were often much larger. The constant background hum of Mediterranean trade in the pre-modern period were small sailing traders engaged in short range “cabotage” trading, often with deadweight tonnages around 30 tons.

But the Hellenistic and subsequent Roman periods also show evidence for much larger freighters in use on the seas. Ships with estimated cargoes well above 100 deadweight tons become reasonably frequent in the Roman period, including one absolutely massive 550 ton freighter—the ultra-large container vessel of its day. Indeed, such large freighters were sufficiently common that port regulations, such as those for Thasos, confined smaller ships to the outer harbor, with the main harbor facilities reserved for larger freighters.

The great boom in trade the Romans enjoyed was not entirely serendipity: While sea trade had been growing prior to Rome’s expansion to encompass the whole of the Mediterranean—a process that advanced in stages from the third to the first centuries B.C.E.—Roman rule notably accelerated that growth. While Roman aristocrats in the Senate often looked down their noses at the sorts of people engaging in trade (while also secretly acting as silent partners in such ventures), Roman rule was, by ancient standards, remarkably pro-trade, compared to the highly fragmented and violent Mediterranean of previous centuries.

The Romans standardized the currency in the Mediterranean, creating a system that was far easier for merchants to utilize in any port they might visit. At the same time, the Romans established a single tariff and customs regime throughout the Empire, lowering trade barriers and most importantly creating a highly predictable trade environment. The expansion of Roman rule also made the seas safe: While early Roman efforts to suppress piracy brought at best mixed results, the eventual expansion of Roman rule to cover the entire Mediterranean littoral denied pirates any safe base free from Roman retaliation. After Pompey’s suppression of the Cilician pirates and conversion of Cilicia into a Roman province, the risk from piracy in the Mediterranean appears to have markedly declined, further opening the seas to trade.

Trade created economic activity, which could be taxed. This was particularly important for pre-modern states like the Roman Empire that lacked the bureaucratic and administrative apparatus to employ more efficient and less distortionary kinds of taxes, like VAT or income taxes. But Rome benefited the most not from the direct revenues it created, but the indirect advantages of trade. The emergence of a robust and predictable system of long-distance trade in bulk staples enabled regional specialization in production to a degree not seen before. Ancient farmers typically diversified their crops and communities produced a little bit of everything; this was safer in an environment where markets were unpredictable and unreliable, but it also meant accepting that a substantial amount of labor and land were committed to the production of crops and goods not well suited to local conditions.

But as markets and long-distance trade became more robust, regions of the Roman world could specialize, albeit to a degree that would strike the modern viewer as quite modest (even if it was unprecedented at the time), counting on the market to deliver the goods they did not produce in exchange for the goods they did.

Modern archaeological work has uncovered numerous examples of such specialized regional production centers, despite how little evidence survives for economic activity two millennia ago. Olive oil from the province of Baetica in southern Spain, for instance, was shipped in bulk as far as Britain to supply Roman armies. Italian villas might specialize in wine production for sale in distant markets in Gaul, while settlements like Leptiminus appear to have specialized in olive oil for export. Settlements specialized in the production of consumer goods, like large-scale production of terra sigillata pottery for export at La Graufesenque in what is today Aveyron, France.

The result was a significant and noticeable uptick in prosperity across the Roman world alongside sustained population growth: Conservative estimates suggest a 25% increase in GDP per capita over this period and population growth from roughly 45 million to over 60 million. That in turn also meant more resources available to the Roman state to fund its public works, benefits, and defense.

Archaeological evidence also allows us to observe the end of this trade-induced economic boom. At first glance, there is a quandary in the evidence: Dateable shipwrecks drop off sharply beginning in the second century, but the distribution of land-based evidence for trade, such as finding trade goods at sites far from their points of manufacture, suggests no decline this early. Instead, what we seem to be observing is the transition from ceramic amphorae to barrels as the container of choice for liquids. Barrels were easier to stack and transport and less likely to break in transit, but whereas amphorae can survive thousands of years underwater to be discovered, barrels, along with the wooden ships that carry them, rot to nothing. When the sample of shipwrecks are limited to those carrying non-perishable cargo like stone, the underwater evidence conforms to the land-based evidence, with trade sharply lower in the fourth century than it was in the third, collapsing to almost nothing by the fifth century.

Any such economic transition stems from complex causes, but the most immediate cause for the decline in Roman trade was simply that the political conditions that had enabled the Roman trade boom in the first place ceased. Beginning in 235, the Romans entered a period known as the Crisis of the Third Century: Five decades of renewed civil war shattered the unity of the empire and thus the unity and safety of its markets. Rival emperors, locked in brutal military competition, debased the currency to pay their soldiers and buy loyalty, leading the once reliable Roman currency system to become shaky at best.

Worse yet, when the crisis came to an end, the policies the newly triumphant emperors Diocletian and later Constantine pursued hardly favored economic freedom or the renewal of markets. When Diocletian’s fumbling efforts to stabilize the Roman currency system produced runaway inflation, he responded with the traditional expedient of attempting to fix prices, issuing an edict on maximum prices, the text of which is partially preserved today.

Like most such state interventions in the economy, the edict failed to stabilize prices. Meanwhile, Diocletian also revised the tax system, creating a bureaucratic, centralized, and cumbersome taxes that relied on a five-year census that was never regularly performed, leading to tax assessments that bore little resemblance to the economic activity they were taxing. In an effort to stabilize this system, Constantine, rather than creating a more agile tax system, created a less agile economy, forbidding tenant farmers to leave their lands in a forerunner of what would become European serfdom.

The result was that while the Roman economy stabilized, it did so as a less productive economy, more exposed to the decisions and caprice of emperors and one that provided, as a result, fewer resources for the Romans to defend their empire.

It was a poor time for Rome to be without its economic might, as intensifying security threats on both the Rhine-Danube frontier and with the Sassanid Empire in the East demanded greater spending on Rome’s armies. The resulting heavy taxation likely depressed the Roman economy further, one element out of many in the downward spiral that led to the eventual fragmentation and dissolution of the Empire in the West in the fifth century.

It is no new thing for political authorities to assume that “trade is bad,” and to inaccurately view trade deficits as a form of theft. Yet societies that act on that elite disdain risk destroying the very thing that enabled their prosperity and strength in the first place.

Far from ending the war in 24 hours as he repeatedly promised, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Ukraine policy has been a failure. It has now been more than 100 days, and not only has there been no peace agreement or lasting cease-fire, but Trump has become so frustrated by his inability to deliver a deal that he is now threatening to walk away from talks altogether. Meanwhile, both sides are suffering hundreds of casualties per week along the front lines, and Russia continues to rain down missiles and drones on Ukrainian cities, killing thousands of civilians.

The failure of Trump’s approach was predictable. His assumption was that he could bully Ukraine into giving Russia what it wanted by embracing Russia’s narrative about the war and threatening to cut off U.S. support to Kyiv. But that underestimated both what Russia wanted—Ukraine’s complete subjugation—and a proudly independent Ukraine’s willingness to accept it. Even worse, by failing to include any threat of consequences for Russia if it refused to compromise, Trump gave up much of his leverage without getting anything in return, essentially saying to Moscow, “If you don’t agree with my plan, I’ll walk away and give you everything you want”—not exactly the art of the deal. If a petulant Trump does now walk away from attempts to broker peace, the result will be the indefinite perpetuation of a brutal war; continued threats to Ukraine’s territory, sovereignty, and democracy; and a further blow to Trump’s dream of appearing to be a diplomatic dealmaker.

There is an alternative, however, that even Trump should be willing to pursue. It would consist of spelling out costs Moscow will incur if it continues down its current path. This would be an excellent project for Trump’s new national security advisor/secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who was once a strong supporter of Ukraine’s independence and right to self-defense. And now is the right moment, ahead of possible direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey later this week—talks that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pledged to attend in person. Trump himself seems to recognize that diplomacy has reached a critical juncture, proclaiming that this week’s meeting will “determine whether or not a deal is possible” and that if it is not, European leaders and the United States will “proceed accordingly.”

But films like IraH, Kalki 2898 AD, or even Srijit Mukherji’s Oti Uttam , are just a start. Unlike Hollywood, where AI is mostly used for scripts, de-aging, or background visuals, Indian filmmakers are leaping straight to full-throttle prompt-driven production. The upcoming Hindi films Naisha and Maharaja in Denims, along with the Kannada-language Love You, are all vying for the title of India’s first AI-generated feature film. Directors are now using text prompts to plan scenes and sketch out entire films with tools like Midjourney, Luma AI, Runway, and ElevenLabs.

“Sometimes I’d tell my director, ‘Don’t tell me what’s going to happen—let me feel the moment,’” Roy said, adding that he was stunned when he saw the final cut during dubbing. “It’s crazy how much AI and VFX can transform the film.”

New Delhi: A dramatic confrontation with thin air, gazing at a chopper that didn’t exist, reacting to an enemy created by code, performing on empty sets with no physical cues. For actor Rohit Bose Roy, the AI-generated sequences in the 2024 film IRaH demanded every ounce of his imagination.

Studios dedicated entirely to AI filmmaking are emerging across the country. Tollywood’s Dil Raju has launched Larven AI Studio. Ajay Devgn has unveiled Prismix. Chandigarh’s Intelliflicks Studios is behind Maharaja in Denims and Mumbai-based Amazing Indian Stories is developing Naisha.

“Our vision is that in the same way anyone can write a poem or a book today, people will be able to tell their story with a movie made with AI,” said Gurdeep Singh Pall, co-founder of Intelliflicks Studios and president of AI Strategy at Qualtrics, a US-based software company.

AI could democratise the expensive business of filmmaking, according to him.

“Filmmaking was traditionally an analog process, limited by physical methods. About 20 years ago, digital cameras and CGI made VFX the go-to for effects that analog couldn’t manage. Now generative AI can handle most digital tasks at a fraction of the cost and time, making filmmaking far more accessible,” he added.

At Cannes 2025, Intelliflicks announced its Hollywood debut with a five-film deal alongside The Conjuring creator Tony DeRosa-Grund. The slate spans supernatural horror to animated spy thrillers. With Maharaja in Denims nearing release, Intelliflicks is positioning India as a serious contender in the AI-filmmaking space.

AI isn’t the same as CGI, where artists build digital visuals from scratch, or VFX, which merges those visuals into live-action. It can generate anything from stills to video, voices to faces from text prompts. A filmmaker can type something like “18th-century Jaipur palace with sandstone domes” into Midjourney for concept images. Those can then guide Luma AI to animate videos or build 3D environments. The process still needs human input, but much less of it.

Hollywood has been experimenting for years, though with a lighter touch of late, especially in the wake of protests over AI. The Brutalist and Emilia Pérez, both of which won Oscars this year, used the AI tool Respeecher to alter vocal tones and dialects. Here used de-aging technology from VFX company Metaphysic on Tom Hanks and Robin Wright. In Alien: Romulus, AI was used to resurrect the character Ash from the 1979 original, even though actor Ian Holm had died. Indian productions, meanwhile, are now going all in.

At the World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025, filmmaker Shekhar Kapur declared AI will replace film stars, allowing directors to create and copyright lifelike characters. Even platforms like Pocket FM now use AI for voices and music in their audio stories. But the excitement comes with unease. There are tough questions about job loss, creative control, and whether machine-generated films can capture the heart that drives Bollywood storytelling. Kapur himself experimented with ChatGPT to write the script of the upcoming Masoom 2, but eventually concluded it wasn’t as “creative” as him.

There’s a place for both, according to Naisha director Vivek Anchalia.

“We’re entering an era where human-made work will become premium—just like how handmade goods gained value after the industrial revolution,” he said.

AI goes epic

The trailer of Maharaja in Denims looks every bit like a grand Indian epic, but the uncanny valley is hard to cross. The faces are unmistakably Indian, but they don’t have stories behind their eyes. The palaces have no memories in their walls. The dancers move with grace, but they’ve never practiced. A character jolts awake from a nightmare, but his chest stays still. No heartbeat. No breath. It’s hyper-realistic but not real.

Since 2023, a team of prompt engineers at Intelliflicks has been using tools like Runway, Midjourney, and Stability AI to create the film, which spans a wide sweep of history, from the Afghan-Sikh wars to Partition, the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, and the Mumbai terror attack. According to the South China Morning Post, AI helped bring production costs down to one-sixth of the estimated US$6 million budget it would have taken to make it the traditional way.

Most of the film is AI-generated, although its source material is a book by Khushwant Singh, not to be confused with the late namesake Train to Pakistan author.

Singh, who is the CEO of Intelliflicks Studios, said the goal was to push the limits of AI on screen. The studio has shared teasers and behind-the-scenes glimpses of the project, which is set to release between July and September.

“We’re now at a very interesting stage of realism,” said Singh. “There is so much you can do with AI—you can create massive sets, kings, royals, grandiose visuals.”

A similar experiment is unfolding with Naisha, so named for its pouty-lipped, blemishless, ageless heroine. The project started as a music video, but escalating costs forced director Vivek Anchalia to pivot to AI. Eventually, the project evolved into a full-length romantic film.

If it had been made the traditional way, the budget could have easily crossed Rs 70 crore, according to Anchalia, “but with AI, we pulled it off for less than 5 per cent of that cost.” Similarly, the Kannada Love You reportedly cost only Rs 10 lakh to make.

But the shift to long-form storytelling has brought its own hiccups. The tech evolves so fast that completed scenes often need to be redone to keep up.

“Naisha Bose”, the AI-generated lead actress, has already made an appearance in a Kalon jewellery ad, which also featured AI-created music.

“If you look at the ad now compared to the trailer we released earlier, you’ll see the drastic difference. The goal now is to bring Naisha’s visuals in the film up to that standard,” Anchalia told ThePrint.

The film is expected to release later this year and a flurry of finishing touches is underway.

“When we have a release date, we have to do a lot of work toward the end to stay updated,” Anchalia said.

In IRaH, released in 2024, around 60 percent of the visuals—especially action scenes—were created using AI and VFX. The AI character IRAH (an anagram of Hira, Roy’s character) plays a central role. He plays both a 22-year-old and a nearly 52-year-old in the film—an age transformation made possible entirely through AI.

“AI should be enhancing a film or a piece of art, adding to the original work. I don’t want AI to take over the work that I’m doing. If it enhances my work, I’m all for it,” 56-year-old Roy said. “AI is a technical assistant. It won’t do anything unless a coder tells it to.”

Machine behind the magic

Naisha Bose’s mother is from Mizoram and her father is from Bengal. Her hunky boyfriend Zain Kapoor is vaguely reminiscent of Vicky Kaushal, or maybe a young Abhay Deol. They dive into azure waters, drive past scenic mountains, smooch in trains, dance in clubs.

These and all other characters in the film were created from scratch using AI, with no real faces or existing images involved, according to Anchalia.

The team fed a stream of prompts—age, ethnicity, body type, hair colour, eye shape—into seven or eight different tools like Midjourney, Luma, and Kring. With each iteration, the characters evolved.

Anchalia and his colleague Harikesh Pawar often worked through the night, often till 5 am, wrestling with prompts to craft that one perfect scene. But after hours of effort, they’d sometimes have to scrap it all. AI actors falter where real ones often shine—they can look flawless but their eyes don’t reflect pain, the body language can be off.

“There was a shot—Zain holding Naisha from behind outside a theatre, both looking ahead. I wanted a precise body movement: he leaves, exits one side, she turns at just the right moment. It was all very deliberate. I spent hours getting the image right, but the video just wouldn’t work. I had to let it go,” Anchalia said.

Most of the footage is AI-generated, but real actors were used for motion capture. Human voice actors filled lead roles, with real composers scoring the music.

But there’s now an AI tool for nearly every step of the filmmaking process—Midjourney for generating detailed images, Runway for video editing, Pika and Luma for video creation, Kring for visual effects, ElevenLabs for lifelike voice generation.

To make Naisha, one software sculpted faces, breathing life into digital flesh. Others worked on bringing emotion in the AI voices, while the rest stitched together entire scenes and sets.

“For images, it’s about how cinematic, realistic, and beautifully composed they are. With video, the focus shifts to body movement, fidelity, and avoiding glitches like morphing or distortion. You also look at how well the software sticks to the prompt—dynamism, camera movement. In audio, the key is voice variety, especially for filler characters, since main roles are voiced by real actors,” Anchalia said.

Still, maintaining character consistency is tricky—faces can change, and geometry can shift mid-scene.

“The biggest hurdle is these models are trained largely on Western aesthetics. Indian faces, especially women, were hard to get right. Had we made a Western film, we would’ve been done at twice the speed,” said Singh. He added that when given prompts for an Indian woman, the AI always defaults to a face with a bindi.

The Maharaja in Denims team works out of a garage in Chandigarh—five to seven people huddled around Apple desktops. The director, co-director, editor, and creative head all test prompts like “Indian male, royal-looking, with a necklace, Sikh turban”. When a “eureka” moment comes, it’s a wrap.

Pall said the film primarily uses Gen AI for visual elements like actors, scenes, motion, and lighting. Other tasks like screenplay, music, and dialogue, however, need more human intervention.

“It’s all trial and error—a test of patience,” Singh said. “This isn’t traditional filmmaking. It’s a whole new medium, a breakthrough. Why compare it? It’s tech, yet it tells stories that feel real. It’s a new kind of cinema.”

The process isn’t always cheap either. In IRAH, director Sam Bhattacharjee spent over a year on post-production. Without his own in-house VFX and AI setup, costs could have exceeded the film’s full production budget, Roy said. As AI becomes more accessible, however, the cost is likely to come down.

Singh said that the technology brings costs down by 10 times. But it’s not just about saving money.

“You can now attempt projects you’d never have dared to dream of because of budget constraints,” Singh added.

Creativity, consent, and control

On the surface, AI looks like a great leveller. Filmmakers can now dream bigger, spend less, and bypass many of the old industry gatekeepers.

“Today, producers stick to safe formulas—spies, RAW, action and crime dramas. AI will allow more risk-taking, more room for diverse ideas,” Anchalia said.

But with this creative revolution come significant ethical concerns.

The AI craze in Hollywood took a Black Mirror-like turn in 2023. Studios began offering background actors one-time fees to scan their faces and use their digital replicas forever, in any project, with no further pay. There was immediate pushback—the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) went on strike and Hollywood ground to a halt.

Since then, US studios have been forced to reckon with new rules around consent, likeness rights, and where the line between man and machine should be drawn.

India hasn’t had such a moment yet. But the same questions are starting to bubble up. AI is already deeply integrated into various stages of filmmaking and old roles are changing. Writers are using ChatGPT to crank out story drafts. Directors are visualising scenes with AI tools. Set designers are crafting virtual sets. Cinematographers are generating lighting references. It’s bionic filmmaking and everyone becomes a set of parts.

For some, a line has to be drawn for the sake of art itself.

“Most Indian films are deeply rooted in emotion and storytelling. Think of something like Dil Chahta Hai—you can’t imagine that being made by AI,” said Rajesh Ramaswamy, an ad filmmaker. “We’re a culture driven by emotion—something machines can’t replicate. AI can enhance parts of the process, but only to a point.”

But Anchalia scoffs at the romanticisation of human abilities.

“In the long term, everybody is replaceable, except the director who gives vision to the film. AI does things better because it is intelligence,” said Anchalia. “We think we’re mystical creatures with emotions and lived experience—but in most jobs, mimicking those things is all that’s required. And AI is very good at mimicking.”

Performers are feeling the heat. Roy said many actors are now trademarking their image and voice, worried about the implications for their work. In 2023, Anil Kapoor won a landmark case protecting his image rights and even his “jhakaas” catchphrase.

“Whether AI is a superhero or supervillain depends on ethics—how we raise it. Both governments and individuals share responsibility,” said Anchalia.

Pall said it’s hard to predict how this will evolve, as much of it depends on cultural readiness.

“We might see stars appear as AI avatars, or a shift toward valuing story and quality over star power, similar to Hollywood,” he added. “Indian audiences embraced shows like Money Heist from Spain, despite the lack of local stars. The same could happen with high-quality, accessible Gen AI content.”

What should have followed is a debate on careers. Should women only have ‘respectable’ careers once they get married? And who gets to decide this? Who should compromise on their dreams and ambitions for the sake of the relationship? But Abhinetri fails to ask these questions. It begins with a bang but ends with a whimper.

Malini’s character Anjana is a professional dancer—an independent woman who takes pride in her profession. She is far removed from the stereotype of the docile woman who needed rescuing or one who propels a revenge plot. Tropes that Bollywood relied on at the time. Anjana meets a scientist, Shekhar (Kapoor), marries him, gives up her stage career, only to resume after he starts spending more time in the lab.

Two years after her acting debut in the 1968 film Sapno Ka Saudagar , Hema Malini starred in Subodh Mukherjee’s Abhinetri alongside Shashi Kapoor. In many ways, the movie was ahead of its time.

The tragedy of the movie lies in its squandered potential. Both Malini and Kapoor would go on to become heavyweights in the film industry, but as young actors, their performances lacked emotional depth. Malini was still learning the ropes. And Mukherjee—and the script—failed to tap into her raw talent. The irony is that two years later, Malini stole the show in Seeta Aur Geeta (1972) and won the hearts of the nation.

Perhaps Abhinetri relied a little too much on the good looks of its stars to hide a weak plot. “Kapoor and Malini were the Barbie and Ken of the ’70s,” read one comment on a YouTube video of the movie.

Mother’s solution



When the movie begins, Anjana is a relatively popular stage dancer, a single woman building her life in a big city. One stormy night, she finds Shekhar taking refuge from the rain under her porch. The chemistry between the two actors, and the fact that they start arguing almost immediately, make their first meeting entertaining and memorable.

But it’s all downhill after that. There is no concrete reason for Anjana giving up a thriving career after marriage. Shekhar’s disapproval of his wife’s profession is not as impactful as it should have been. The movie also stretches endlessly trying to establish the conflict, but then resolves it in the blink of an eye.

Anjana’s friend Ratna (Nazima) calls Shekhar’s mother (Nirupa Roy) to help the couple, without them knowing. Shekhar’s mother, who likes and ‘approves of’ Anjana, steps in to restore domestic harmony. If anything, a mother coming in to save her son’s marriage is boring —it adheres to the mama’s boy trope. When the two finally reconcile in the end, there is no clarity over whether Shekhar is finally ready to accept his wife for the talented dancer she is, or if Anjana will continue working.

The plot is riddled with holes. When the couple fights for the first time over her plan to return to the stage, Shekhar says that he does not like certain aspects of her career. Anjana replies, “Mujhe bhi kuch cheezein pasand nai, but chacha ji ke liye kar rahi hoon.” (I too do not like some aspects, but I am doing it for my uncle). There is no explanation about what aspects she does not like.

The characterisation of her uncle in this dialogue also stands in contrast to how he’s otherwise portrayed in the film. Anjana’s uncle, who is also her manager, is shown as a father figure to her. There is no exploitation, and Anjana is even selective about whom she works for. When a producer offers one lakh for a role in a movie, her uncle refuses it, citing the man’s transactional personality.

“Anju kala ki pujaran hai, sirf paison ke liye kaam nahi karegi” (Anju respects art, she won’t work for money alone),” says her uncle.

Shekhar’s character, on the other hand, takes pride in the fact that his mother had to give up her professional career as a singer because of him. He does not see why his wife can’t do the same. However, the conflict between the two never really feels heartbreaking, as Mukherjee quickly offers a solution for his audience.

This theme was also later explored in Abhimaan (1973) with more impact. Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan play a married couple who are both singers. But Uma (Jaya Bachchan) ends up becoming more popular after Subir (Amitabh Bachchan) ‘discovers’ her talent and marries her.

The movie skillfully explores the impact of a wife’s professional life, especially if it revolves around arts or entertainment, on a married couple’s domestic harmony. The conflict between the two is played out in a more nuanced manner, as we watch the transformation of Subir from a supportive husband to an egotistical competitor.

Highlights of the film

The movie’s lack of a well-rounded plot with nuance is made up for by the costumes and music. The costumes were designed by the Oscar-winning designer Bhanu Athaiya. In the opening sequence of the film, Malini wears an Amrapali outfit—a bustier paired with a draped dhoti. The silhouette was popularised by Athaiya, who first designed it for Vyjayanthimala in the 1966 film Amrapali.

Athaiya drapes her in stylish outfits, ranging from embroidered sarees to summer dresses. The flawless winged eyeliner and elaborate hairdos complement them.

After she starts dating Shekhar and post her marriage, Anjana mostly wears sarees. When she starts performing again, her costumes are fusion or western.

The movie’s songs help where the plot does not. The ever dependable Laxmikant-Pyarelal’s songs were tailor-made for the various moments in the film.

O Ghata Sanwari and Sajna O Sajna, two solos by Lata Mangeshkar, are a treat to hear even today. Sa Re Ga Ma Pa by Mangeshkar highlights the two lovers constantly rediscovering the giddiness of first love and marital bliss. When Shekhar gets upset that Anjana pulls him out of work just to spend a day with him, she sings Khiche Humse Sawre, to wheedle him.

With Milte Hi Rahenge Hum, sung by Mangeshkar and Mahendra Kapoor, Anjana reminds Shekhar of their own love story, while performing on stage. When the two actors are romancing each other, the movie feels impeccable. Otherwise, it does not warrant a re-watch.

हरियाणा के एक यूट्यूबर ने 2024 और 2025 में पाकिस्तान का सफर किया. यह सिर्फ यूट्यूब पर कुछ हजार व्यूज के लिए नहीं था, बल्कि इस उम्मीद में था कि वो अपने हरियाणा गांव अपने 90 साल के लकवाग्रस्त दादा के लिए पाकिस्तान की मिट्टी ला सके.

“बचपन में वो कबीर वाला की अपनी ज़िंदगी की कहानियां सुनाते थे, और उनकी आंखें भर आती थीं,” 38 साल के इस यूट्यूबर ने कहा, जिन्होंने नाम न बताने की गुज़ारिश की. “मैं उन्हें वहाँ नहीं ले जा सका, लेकिन उनकी जन्मभूमि से मिट्टी ज़रूर लाया. जब उन्होंने उसे माथे से लगाया और झुककर प्रणाम किया, तो वो पल बेहद भावुक था.”

जासूसी के शक में यूट्यूबर ज्योति मल्होत्रा और पंजाब, हरियाणा, उत्तर प्रदेश के 11 अन्य लोगों की गिरफ्तारी ने उन हरियाणवी कंटेंट क्रिएटर्स पर सवाल खड़े कर दिए हैं, जो वाघा बॉर्डर पार कर कैमरे के साथ पाकिस्तान गए थे. इन यात्रियों में ज़्यादातर हरियाणा की जाट और पंजाबी बिरादरी से आते हैं, जो दोनों देशों के बीच पनपे तनाव से पहले क्रॉस-कल्चरल वीडियो बना रहे थे. पाकिस्तान जाना सिर्फ वायरल कंटेंट बनाने के लिए नहीं था, बल्कि विभाजन के कारण टूटी जड़ों से दोबारा जुड़ने की कोशिश भी थी. उनके लिए पाकिस्तान एक सांस्कृतिक और पुश्तैनी तीर्थ की तरह है, जिसे बंटवारे की विरासत और भी गहरा बनाती है.

ज्योति मल्होत्रा, जिनके माता-पिता पाकिस्तान से आए थे, ने अपने यूट्यूब चैनल “ट्रैवल विद जो” के ज़रिए इस तलाश को दर्शाया, जिसके 3,77,000 से ज़्यादा सब्सक्राइबर हैं.

इन वीडियोज़ की लोकप्रियता की वजह यह है कि ये बंटवारे के कारण बने ऐतिहासिक फासले को कम करते हैं.

“हरियाणवी दर्शक इन वीडियोज़ से जुड़ते हैं क्योंकि ये पाकिस्तान को खोए हुए घर जैसा बनाते हैं,” सेंटर फॉर स्टडी ऑन डिवेलपिंग सोसाइटीज़ (CSDS) की रिसर्च स्कॉलर ज्योति मिश्रा ने कहा. सीमा पार की कहानियों की नए तरीके और इमोशनल स्टोरीटेलिंग इन्हें और फेमस बनाते हैं.

हरियाणवी यात्री

हरियाणा के जाट बहुल इलाके से विकास श्योराण और उनकी पत्नी रितु खोखर ने 1947 में हरियाणा से पलायन करने वाले मुस्लिम जाटों पर ध्यान केंद्रित करके पाकिस्तान की अपनी यात्राओं का दस्तावेजीकरण किया है. उनके वीडियो उन परंपराओं को दिखाते हैं जो भारत की एक पीढ़ी ने कभी नहीं देखीं और जो धर्म और देश की सीमाओं से आगे की बात करती हैं.

इनमें पाकिस्तान के पंजाब प्रांत के लोग शामिल हैं—वे हरियाणवी बोलते हैं और कुश्ती और लोक नृत्य जैसी जाट परंपराओं को कायम रखते हैं. उदाहरण के लिए, हरियाणवी अपनी हाजिर-जवाबी के लिए प्रसिद्ध हैं, हर मौके के लिए एक चुटकुला तैयार रखते हैं, अक्सर इतने जोश के साथ कि हंसी दूर-दूर तक गूंजती है.

यूट्यूबर विकास श्योराण द्वारा अपने फेसबुक पर साझा किए गए एक वीडियो में, पाकिस्तान के मुल्तान में मुस्लिम जाटों का एक समूह इस हरियाणवी परंपरा को अपनाते हुए दिखाई देते हैं, जो जोर-जोर से हंसते हुए मज़ेदार चुटकुले सुनाते हैं, और ये दिखाते हैं कि हंसी सभी लोगों को जोड़ सकती है, चाहे वे कहीं भी हों. विभाजन ने हरियाणा के पंजाबी समुदायों पर एक अमिट छाप छोड़ी, जिनके कई पूर्वज अब पाकिस्तान के क्षेत्रों से पलायन कर गए थे. इसी तरह, जाट समुदाय के लोग हैं जिनके हरियाणा में मुस्लिम पड़ोसी और दोस्त पाकिस्तान चले गए.

ज्योति मल्होत्रा ​​की 2023 और 2024 की पाकिस्तान यात्राएं, जो वीडियो में दिखाए गए हैं, जहां वे अपने पैतृक स्थानों और पाकिस्तान उच्चायोग की यात्राएँ करते हैं, उन दर्शकों को पसंद आईं जिनके पूर्वजों ने साझा इतिहास और अलगाव के आघात को जीया है. अब, उनकी गिरफ़्तारी का मतलब है ऐसे सभी यात्रियों की अधिक जांच जो अपने व्यक्तिगत इतिहास की तलाश में सीमा पार कर गए थे.

सांस्कृतिक जिज्ञासा और व्यक्तिगत रोमांच के मिश्रण से प्रेरित होकर, सिडनी में रहने वाले एक आईटी पेशेवर पवन टोकस ने मार्च 2024 और मार्च 2025 में दो बार पाकिस्तान के मुल्तान शहर का दौरा किया.

टोकस बाहरी दिल्ली के एक गांव के मूल निवासी हैं. उनकी पत्नी रितु सांगवान, जो चैनल चलाती हैं, हरियाणा के चरखी दादरी के चंदेनी गांव से ताल्लुक रखती हैं.

टोकस ने दिप्रिंट को फोन पर बताया, “जहां तक ​​मेरा सवाल है, मेरी उत्सुकता यह थी कि जैसे मैं बंजी जंपिंग कर सकता हूं या आग पर चल सकता हूं, वैसे ही मैं पाकिस्तान भी जा सकता हूं, क्योंकि उस देश में जाना अपने आप में एक काम माना जाता है.” उनके चैनल का नाम ‘पवन टोकस व्लॉग’ है और इसमें ननकाना साहिब और अन्य ऐतिहासिक स्थलों के वीडियो हैं. उनके व्लॉग में हरियाणवी भाषी समुदाय शामिल हैं.

टोकस पाकिस्तान के मुस्लिम जाट परिवारों में हरियाणवी संस्कृति के संरक्षण से प्रभावित थे. उन्होंने कहा, “हरियाणा में युवा पीढ़ी हिंदी की ओर झुकाव रखती है, जबकि पाकिस्तान में ये परिवार अभी भी हरियाणवी बोलते हैं.” मुल्तान की अपनी एक यात्रा के दौरान टोकस को मुस्लिम जाट पब्लिक स्कूल नामक एक स्कूल भी मिला. उन्होंने कहा, “वे अभी भी सर छोटू राम जैसे जाट नेताओं को अपना आदर्श मानते हैं और उनके नाम पर एक स्कूल भी है.”

फरवरी 2024 में अपने फेसबुक पोस्ट में टोकस को खलील अहमद जाट के साथ पोज देते हुए देखा गया. वीडियो को अब हटा दिया गया है. उन्होंने एक दूसरे के कंधों पर हाथ रखा हुआ था. बैकग्राउंड में 1980 की बॉलीवुड हिट फिल्म दोस्ताना का गाना बज रहा था: रहे चाहे दुश्मन जमाना हमारा, सलामत रहे दोस्ताना हमारा…

रोहतक के डॉक्टर से व्लॉगर बने नवांकुर चौधरी—जिन्हें ‘यात्री डॉक्टर’ के नाम से जाना जाता है—ने पाकिस्तान का दौरा किया और वहां की जाट विरासत से फिर से जुड़ने की कोशिश की. वह अपने पासपोर्ट पर हर देश की मुहर लगाने के मिशन पर हैं.

मल्होत्रा ​​की गिरफ्तारी के बाद, चौधरी ने फेसबुक पर लाइव सेशन में अपनी स्थिति स्पष्ट की, जिसमें उन्होंने बताया कि सीमा पार यात्राएं कोई दुर्लभ बात नहीं हैं.

“मैं अकेला नहीं था—700-800 लोग थे, जिनमें भारत से 500 और दूसरे देशों से 50-60 राजनयिक शामिल थे. मैं एक यूट्यूबर हूं, इसलिए मुझे हाइलाइट किया जाता है, लेकिन हर साल हजारों लोग पाकिस्तान जाते हैं, जिनमें हिंदू और सिख समूह भी शामिल हैं. मैं एक गौरवान्वित भारतीय हूं, जिसका परिवार सशस्त्र बलों में है और मैं किसी भी जांच में सहायता करने के लिए तैयार हूं.”

उन्होंने अपनी स्थिति स्पष्ट करते हुए फेसबुक पर जो वीडियो पोस्ट किया था, वह अब सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म से हटा दिया गया है.

जाट कनेक्शन

हरियाणा के जाट इलाक़े—रोहतक, झज्जर, हिसार और बहादुरगढ़—का पाकिस्तान के पंजाब से एक खास रिश्ता है, जहां बंटवारे के बाद मुस्लिम जाट बस गए थे. ये समुदाय हरियाणवी या इससे मिलती-जुलती बोलियां बोलते हैं और कृषि त्योहारों और लोक नृत्यों जैसी परंपराओं को ज़िंदा रखते हैं, जो हरियाणा जैसी ही हैं.

श्योराण, खोखर, टोकेस और सांगवान जैसे यूट्यूबर्स के लिए ये रिश्ते उनके कंटेंट का केंद्र हैं, जो उनके सोशल मीडिया पोस्ट में दिखता है. उनके वीडियो में पाकिस्तानियों से भावनात्मक बातचीत दिखाई देती है, जो बंटवारे की कहानियां बताते हैं. ये कहानियां यूट्यूबर्स के अपने पारिवारिक इतिहास से मेल खाती हैं.

टोकेस ने इस रिश्ते की एक गहरी मिसाल साझा की जो उन्होंने खुद देखी: “मेरे दोस्त जयबीर सिंह, जो हरियाणा के गुड़ा गांव से हैं और अब अमेरिका में रहते हैं, मार्च में मुल्तान गए. जब वे हमारे मेज़बान सलीम अली के घर पहुंचे, तो मोहम्मद अली, जो बंटवारे के समय गुड़ा से पाकिस्तान गए थे, उनका इंतज़ार कर रहे थे. वे अपनी भावनाएं नहीं रोक पाए, जयबीर को गले लगाया और कहा कि यह 35 साल में पहली बार है जब वे अपने गांव के किसी व्यक्ति से मिले हैं.”

ऐसी मुलाक़ातें उस “मिट्टी की कसक” को दिखाती हैं जो टोकेस के अनुसार कई लोगों को इस यात्रा के लिए प्रेरित करती है.

“हरियाणवियों के लिए एक अलग ही खिंचाव है. 1947 के बंटवारे के दौरान, पाकिस्तान के पंजाब से करीब 70-80 लाख हिंदू और सिख भारत आए, जिनमें से अधिकतर हरियाणा, पंजाब और दिल्ली में बस गए. इसी तरह, भारत से लगभग उतने ही मुस्लिम पाकिस्तान गए, जिनमें से कई हरियाणा से थे. 1947 में भले ही सीमाएं खींच दी गईं, पर साझा संस्कृति आज भी बनी हुई है. ये यूट्यूबर्स अपने अतीत से एक ज़िंदा रिश्ता खोजते हैं, जो उनके कंटेंट को व्यक्तिगत और सार्वभौमिक बनाता है,” मिश्रा ने कहा.

हरियाणवी यूट्यूबर्स का कंटेंट सांस्कृतिक खोज पर आधारित होता है, जिसमें पाकिस्तान के बाज़ार, धार्मिक स्थल जैसे करतारपुर साहिब और हरियाणवी बोलने वाले स्थानीय लोगों से बातचीत दिखाई जाती है.

मल्होत्रा के लाहौर वाले वीडियो लाखों बार देखे गए क्योंकि उन्होंने पाकिस्तानी ज़िंदगी को असली रूप में दिखाया. श्योराण और टोकेस के वीडियो, जिनमें ज़िंदादिल गलियां और दिल से की गई बातचीत होती है, अक्सर लोगों की पुरानी यादें ताज़ा कर देते हैं.

“जैसे पाकिस्तान में हरियाणा को देख रहे हों,” ऐसा एक कमेंट श्योराण के पंजाब में जाट शादी वाले वीडियो पर लिखा गया.

टोकेस, जो पाकिस्तान में नेशनल ऑर्गनाइज़ेशन फॉर हरयाणवी रेस्टिट्यूशन ऑफ आर्ट्स (NOHRA) से जुड़े हैं, ने बताया कि पाकिस्तानी स्कूलों में हरियाणवी संस्कृति और भाषा को बचाने की कोशिशें की जा रही हैं.

रीलों को छोटा कर दिया गया

ज्योति मल्होत्रा की गिरफ्तारी के बाद हरियाणा के यूट्यूबर्स को लेकर एक नई बहस शुरू हो गई है—क्या पाकिस्तान की यात्रा करना और वहां बनाए गए वीडियो भारत की सुरक्षा के लिए खतरा हैं?

टोकेस ने कहा कि ये यात्राएं सिर्फ यूट्यूबर्स तक सीमित नहीं हैं.

“ऑपरेशन सिंदूर से पहले भी कई लोग पाकिस्तान गए हैं—कभी उसकी खूबसूरती के लिए, कभी अपने पुरखों की ज़मीन देखने के लिए. क्या अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी वहां बस से नहीं गए थे? अगर वीजा में ढील हो, तो दोनों देशों से ज़्यादा लोग एक-दूसरे के यहां जाएंगे.”

इन यूट्यूबर्स को अब ऑनलाइन आलोचना का सामना करना पड़ रहा है, जिससे उनकी लोकप्रियता को झटका लगा है. ‘यात्री डॉक्टर’ यानी नवनकौर चौधरी की ज्योति मल्होत्रा से नज़दीकी पर सवाल उठे हैं, और उनके पुराने फोटो भी सामने आए हैं.

नवांकर के पिता, नवीन धनखड़, जो रिटायर्ड नेवी अफसर हैं, ने कहा कि उनके बेटे का ज्योति मल्होत्रा से कोई संबंध नहीं है. जो तस्वीर फैलाई जा रही है, वह एक इवेंट की है, जहां वह खुद को उनके बेटे की फैन बताते हुए मिली थीं.

“इन यात्राओं का गलत फायदा उठाया जा सकता है,” हरियाणा केंद्रीय विश्वविद्यालय में लॉ के प्रोफेसर और पहले भारतीय वायु सेना में सेवा कर चुके राजेश मलिक ने कहा. “यूट्यूबर्स जाने-अनजाने में संवेदनशील जानकारी साझा कर सकते हैं या दबाव में आ सकते हैं, खासकर उन इलाकों में जहां भू-राजनीतिक हालात जटिल हैं. सांस्कृतिक खोज और सुरक्षा खतरे के बीच की रेखा बहुत पतली है, इसलिए सतर्कता ज़रूरी है.”

13 मई 2025 को सरकार द्वारा पाकिस्तान हाई कमीशन के एक अधिकारी को जासूसी के आरोप में देश से निकाले जाने की घटना ने यह दिखा दिया कि सीमापार संपर्कों में खतरे कितने ज़्यादा हो सकते हैं—अगर उनका मकसद सिर्फ सांस्कृतिक हो.

हरियाणा पुलिस ने बहादुरगढ़ में नवांकर चौधरी के परिवार से पूछताछ की है.

“ये यूट्यूबर्स एक बंटी हुई इतिहास की कहानी कहने वाले हैं, लेकिन उन्हें बहुत संभलकर चलना चाहिए. इनका काम या तो दूरी कम कर सकता है या शक बढ़ा सकता है—ये इस पर निर्भर करता है कि वो इसे कैसे पेश करते हैं,” मिश्रा ने कहा.

नई दिल्ली: अरुणाचल प्रदेश में पहली बार शुरू हुआ फ़िल्म और टेलीविज़न इंस्टीट्यूट इस साल मार्च में चालू हुआ था, लेकिन आज भी यह एक निर्माण स्थल (कंस्ट्रक्शन साइट) जैसा है. अधूरे बने लड़कियों के हॉस्टल, वाई-फाई की सुविधा नहीं, छात्रों के पास पहचान पत्र नहीं, साफ पीने का पानी नहीं, 24×7 बिजली बैकअप नहीं—यही है उन छात्रों की रोज़ की ज़िंदगी जो यहां बड़े परदे के सपने लेकर आए थे. अब यह संस्थान एक प्रदर्शन स्थल बन गया है.

छात्र पिछले एक हफ्ते से कैंपस में बुनियादी सुविधाओं की कमी को लेकर विरोध प्रदर्शन कर रहे हैं. उन्होंने अपनी नाराजगी जताने के लिए सभी क्लासेस का बहिष्कार कर दिया है—सिर्फ संस्थान के प्रशासन से नहीं बल्कि सरकार से भी.

उनकी मांगों में अहम शैक्षणिक ढांचों जैसे क्लासरूम थिएटर और परफॉर्मिंग स्टूडियो का निर्माण, सुरक्षित रास्त और रिटेनिंग वॉल बनाना, सुरक्षा के लिए बाउंड्री वॉल और मुख्य गेट लगवाना शामिल हैं. इसके अलावा वे 24×7 बिजली बैकअप के लिए फ्यूल मैनेजमेंट और साफ पीने के पानी की मांग कर रहे हैं.

“हम यहां पढ़ाई के लिए आए थे, लेकिन यह जगह एक निर्माण स्थल जैसी लगती है. यहां एक भी इमारत ऐसी नहीं है जो एक अच्छे शैक्षणिक संस्थान जैसी दिखे और छात्रों के लिए पर्याप्त सुविधाएं हों,” एक 25 वर्षीय छात्र ने कहा जो पीजी डिप्लोमा (स्क्रीन एक्टिंग) कर रहे हैं. उन्होंने पहचान ना उजागर करने की शर्त पर यह बात कही.

फिल्म एंड टेलीविज़न इंस्टीट्यूट, अरुणाचल प्रदेश, केंद्रीय सूचना और प्रसारण मंत्रालय के अधीन एक शैक्षणिक संस्थान है. इसका संचालन प्रतिष्ठित सत्यजित रे फ़िल्म और टेलीविज़न संस्थान (SRFTI), कोलकाता द्वारा किया जाता है. प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी ने 2019 में अरुणाचल प्रदेश के जोटे में इस संस्थान की नींव रखी थी.

एक 32 वर्षीय महिला छात्रा ने कहा जो स्क्रीनराइटिंग की पढ़ाई कर रही हैं, “जहां लड़कियां रह रही हैं [स्टाफ क्वार्टर], वहां वाई-फाई तक नहीं है. हमें इंटरनेट चलाने के लिए रात में लड़कों के कमरों में जाना पड़ता है.”

जब 2024 में पहले बैच के छात्रों ने दाखिला लिया, तब संस्थान का निर्माण चल रहा था. अधिकारियों ने बताया कि निर्माण कार्य पढ़ाई के साथ-साथ चलेगा और दिसंबर तक कैंपस पूरी तरह से तैयार हो जाएगा.

लेकिन जनवरी आने पर छात्रों को ऑनलाइन क्लास करने के लिए कहा गया, जिसे उन्होंने मानने से इनकार कर दिया.

पहले जिक्र किए गए छात्र ने कहा, “हमें बताया गया था कि कुछ काम बाकी हैं, लेकिन जब मार्च 2025 में हम कैंपस पहुंचे, तो हमारे लिए बनाए गए हॉस्टल तक तैयार नहीं थे.”

लड़कियों को स्टाफ क्वार्टर में और लड़कों को गेस्ट हाउस और ट्रांजिट ब्लॉक में रखा गया. दो महीने बाद भी वे इन्हीं अस्थायी जगहों में रह रहे हैं.

एक-दूसरे पर आरोप लगाने में उलझे

अप्रैल 2025 में, एसआरएफटीआई कोलकाता, फिल्म एंड टेलीविज़न इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ इंडिया पुणे और एफटीआई अरुणाचल प्रदेश को यूनिवर्सिटी ग्रांट्स कमीशन (यूजीसी) एक्ट 1956 के तहत डीम्ड यूनिवर्सिटी का दर्जा मिला. इस मान्यता के तहत ये संस्थान यूजीसी से मान्यता प्राप्त डिग्री, जैसे मास्टर्स प्रोग्राम, दे सकते हैं साथ ही राष्ट्रीय और अंतरराष्ट्रीय विश्वविद्यालयों के साथ क्रेडिट ट्रांसफर और एक्सचेंज प्रोग्राम शुरू कर सकते हैं, जिससे इनकी अकादमिक प्रतिष्ठा बढ़ेगी.

हालांकि एफटीआई अरुणाचल प्रदेश स्वतंत्र रूप से काम करता है, यह एसआरएफटीआई द्वारा तय किए गए शैक्षणिक और संचालन से जुड़े नियमों का पालन करता है, जिससे दोनों संस्थानों में शिक्षा का एक जैसा स्तर बना रहे.

लेकिन छात्रों ने दिप्रिंट को बताया कि संस्थान में ना तो डीन है और ना ही कोई सही प्रशासनिक व्यवस्था.

स्क्रीन एक्टिंग में पोस्टग्रेजुएट डिप्लोमा कोर्स कर रहे एक छात्र ने नाम न बताने की शर्त पर कहा, “संस्थान का पूरा संचालन कोलकाता के प्रशासन द्वारा किया जाता है, जिन्हें यहां की ज़मीनी सच्चाई की जानकारी नहीं है. वो बस हर बार निर्माण कार्य की नई डेडलाइन दे देते हैं.”

उसने बुनियादी प्रशासनिक कमियों पर नाराज़गी जताते हुए कहा, “एक छात्र सबसे पहले अपनी पहचान पत्र की उम्मीद करता है, लेकिन अक्टूबर से लेकर अब तक हमें आईडी कार्ड तक नहीं मिला.”

एफटीआई कैंपस के निर्माण कार्य की देखरेख केंद्रीय लोक निर्माण विभाग (सीपीडब्ल्यूडी) कर रहा है. सीपीडब्ल्यूडी ने पहले तय की गई डेडलाइन को बढ़ाया है और हाल ही में कैंपस की कई इमारतों के काम के लिए नई समयसीमा बताई है.

छात्रों की शिकायत है कि जब वे कोलकाता स्थित निदेशक या प्रशासन से बात करते हैं, तो उन्हें बताया जाता है कि काम सीपीडब्ल्यूडी के तहत आता है. लेकिन जब वे सीपीडब्ल्यूडी के पास जाते हैं, तो उन्हें बताया जाता है कि देरी की वजह स्थानीय ठेकेदार हैं.

“हमारी समस्याएं सुलझाने और बुनियादी ढांचा मुहैया कराने के बजाय यहां बस दोषारोपण का खेल चल रहा है,” 25 वर्षीय एक छात्र ने कहा.

दिप्रिंट ने सीपीडब्ल्यूडी के चीफ़ इंजीनियर मुकेश कुमार से संपर्क किया, लेकिन उन्होंने टिप्पणी करने से इनकार कर दिया.

कैंपस में कम से कम 12 इन्फ्रास्ट्रक्चर प्रोजेक्ट अब भी अधूरे हैं, जिनमें गर्ल्स हॉस्टल भी शामिल है, जिसकी डेडलाइन 15 मई 2025 से बढ़ाकर 31 मई 2025 कर दी गई है.

दिप्रिंट से बात करते हुए एफटीआई के एक अधिकारी ने कहा कि संस्थान छात्रों की अधूरी सुविधाओं से जुड़ी मांगों का समर्थन करता है.

“हमें कभी उम्मीद नहीं थी कि निर्माण कार्य इतना लंबा खिंच जाएगा, या अधिकारी इसे इतना टालते रहेंगे,” उन्होंने कहा.

उन्होंने माना कि सीपीडब्ल्यूडी ने संस्थान को आश्वस्त किया था कि इमारतें चरणों में सौंप दी जाएंगी और पूरा कैंपस दिसंबर 2025 तक तैयार हो जाएगा.

उन्होंने जोड़ा, “हमें आश्वासन मिला है कि प्रोजेक्ट दिसंबर 2025 तक पूरा हो जाएगा. हम बस उम्मीद कर रहे हैं कि डेडलाइन और न बढ़े, और हम छात्रों को क्लास में लौटने के लिए मनाने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं.”

शिकायतों का सिलसिला

लगातार एक हफ्ते से चल रहे विरोध के बाद भी छात्रों को प्रशासन की तरफ़ से सिर्फ़ ज़ुबानी आश्वासन ही मिले हैं. इस बीच सोशल मीडिया, फ़िल्म इंडस्ट्री और पुणे के FTII और कोलकाता के SRFTI के छात्रों का समर्थन लगातार मिल रहा है.

छात्रों के समर्थन में भारतीय फ़िल्ममेकर हंसल मेहता ने इंस्टाग्राम स्टोरी में लिखा: “इंस्टीट्यूट बनाओ, शोर मचाओ, श्रेय लो और फिर उसे सड़ने दो. यही है भारत में ‘नेशन बिल्डिंग’ का महान तरीका.”

फ़िल्ममेकर पायल कपाड़िया, आनंद पटवर्धन और विक्रमादित्य मोटवाने ने भी छात्रों के विरोध की तस्वीरें और अधूरी बिल्डिंग की फोटो इंस्टाग्राम स्टोरी में शेयर कीं और इसे निराशाजनक बताया.

एक छात्र ने कहा, “हम कोई शानो-शौकत नहीं मांग रहे, हम रोशनी, सुरक्षा और सम्मान मांग रहे हैं.”

छात्रों की शिकायतों में साफ़ पीने के पानी की कमी, 24×7 बिजली, पावर बैकअप, कैंपस सुरक्षा, ठीक से काम करने वाले क्लासरूम और डिजिटल सुविधाओं की कमी शामिल है. जरूरी अकादमिक ढांचे जैसे क्लासरूम थिएटर (CRT) और पोस्ट-प्रोडक्शन ब्लॉक अभी भी अधूरे हैं. गंदा पानी पीने से छात्र बीमार हो रहे हैं, इंटरनेट बार-बार बंद हो जाता है और उन्हें अधूरे या असुरक्षित कमरों में क्लास करनी पड़ती है.

एक फैकल्टी सदस्य ने नाम न छापने की शर्त पर कहा, “छात्रों की चिंताएं बिल्कुल जायज़ हैं. बतौर शिक्षक हम देखते हैं कि इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर की कमी उनके सीखने के अनुभव को कैसे प्रभावित कर रही है. पढ़ाई कभी भी सरकारी लेटलतीफी का शिकार नहीं होनी चाहिए. समय पर जवाब देना सिस्टम की सबसे छोटी ज़िम्मेदारी होनी चाहिए.”

छात्र अपनी शिकायतें पीडीएफ दस्तावेज़ों में इकट्ठा कर रहे हैं और उन्होंने साफ़ कर दिया है कि जब तक उनकी मांगें पूरी नहीं होंगी, वे क्लास में नहीं लौटेंगे. वे चाहते हैं कि प्रशासन उन्हें निर्माण कार्य की समाप्ति को लेकर एक लिखित टाइमलाइन दे.

“हमारी मांगें कोई लग्ज़री नहीं हैं—ये एक राष्ट्रीय फ़िल्म संस्थान में पढ़ाई के लिए ज़रूरी बुनियादी ज़रूरतें हैं, जिनके लिए हमने फ़ीस भरी है,” एक 25 वर्षीय छात्र ने कहा, जिसका दो साल का स्क्रीन एक्टिंग कोर्स करीब 3 लाख रुपये का है.

छात्रों की सबसे अहम मांगों में संस्थान को औपचारिक मान्यता, एक ऑफिशियल वेबसाइट, छात्र पहचान-पत्र, कैंपस में एक स्थायी निदेशक और प्रशिक्षित प्रशासनिक स्टाफ़ की नियुक्ति शामिल है.

उस छात्र ने कहा, “हमें लग रहा है जैसे हम यहां बेवकूफ बन गए हैं। यह सिर्फ़ हमारी पढ़ाई और करियर को नहीं, बल्कि हमारी सेहत को भी नुकसान पहुंचा रहा है.”

क्या नरेंद्र मोदी सरकार ने ऑपरेशन सिंदूर के बाद ग्लोबल आउटरीच के लिए सभी दलों के प्रतिनिधिमंडलों में विपक्षी सांसदों और नेताओं को चुनकर राजनीति की?

हां, बिल्कुल. जब सरकार ने पहले ही कांग्रेस के प्रतिनिधियों को तय कर लिया था और मंत्री चार कांग्रेस नेताओं—शशि थरूर, मनीष तिवारी, सलमान खुर्शीद और अमर सिंह—से बात भी कर चुके थे, तो फिर संसदीय कार्य मंत्री किरेन रिजिजू का राज्यसभा और लोकसभा में विपक्ष के नेताओं मल्लिकार्जुन खड़गे और राहुल गांधी को फोन करने का क्या मतलब रह गया?

अगर सरकार को इन चार नेताओं को ही प्रतिनिधिमंडल में शामिल करना था, तो वह कांग्रेस नेतृत्व से सीधा अनुरोध कर सकती थी कि इन्हें ही नामित किया जाए. लेकिन इसके बजाय रिजिजू ने खड़गे और गांधी के प्रतिनिधि भेजने का इंतज़ार किया और फिर सरकार ने अपने हिसाब से कांग्रेस के नाम घोषित कर दिए.

भारतीय जनता पार्टी नेतृत्व को पहले से अंदेशा था कि कांग्रेस थरूर, तिवारी और बाकी दो को नामित नहीं करेगी. कांग्रेस इस जाल में फंस गई. अब मुख्य विपक्ष पार्टी की स्थिति शर्मनाक हो गई है. पार्टी के अंदरूनी मतभेद भी खुलकर सामने आ गए हैं.

लेकिन इससे पहले कि हम यह चर्चा करें कि कांग्रेस हाईकमान ने कैसे गड़बड़ी की, यह साफ़ होना चाहिए कि सरकार ने विपक्ष को राजनीतिक मकसद से इस्तेमाल किया.

सरकार के प्रचार तंत्र से इस बात पर बहस नहीं की जा सकती कि शशि थरूर, जो संसद की स्थायी समिति (विदेश मामलों) के अध्यक्ष हैं और जो संयुक्त राष्ट्र में लगभग तीन दशक तक काम कर चुके हैं, अमेरिका और अन्य देशों में प्रतिनिधिमंडल का नेतृत्व करने के लिए उपयुक्त व्यक्ति थे. 2019 में उन्होंने इस संसदीय समिति के एक सामान्य सदस्य के रूप में काम करने से इनकार कर दिया था क्योंकि वह पिछली लोकसभा में इसके अध्यक्ष थे. मोदी सरकार उन्हें दोबारा इस समिति का अध्यक्ष नहीं बनाना चाहती थी. लेकिन 2024 के लोकसभा चुनाव नतीजों की प्रकृति ने सरकार को मजबूर किया कि वह उन्हें फिर से इस समिति का अध्यक्ष माने.

तो सोचिए, अचानक ऐसा क्या हो गया कि प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी को शशि थरूर अच्छे लगने लगे — वही थरूर जिनकी पत्नी को मोदी ने कभी “50 करोड़ की गर्लफ्रेंड” कहा था?

मान लीजिए, ये सब राजनीति है. यह उस वक्त हो रहा है जब मुख्य विपक्षी पार्टी प्रधानमंत्री मोदी के विश्वगुरु नारे को चुनौती देने की कोशिश कर रही है. 18 मई को कर्नाटक कांग्रेस ने एक्स पर पोस्ट किया: “11 सालों में 72 देशों के 129 दौरे हुए, जिसमें करोड़ों टैक्सपेयर्स का पैसा खर्च हुआ. नतीजा शून्य है. किसी देश ने #OperationSindoor #BJPFailsIndia का समर्थन नहीं किया.”

हालांकि इस पोस्ट में पीएम मोदी का नाम नहीं लिया गया, लेकिन सभी यात्राओं की सूची ने कुछ भी छिपा नहीं छोड़ा. कर्नाटक कांग्रेस की सूची के मुताबिक, पीएम मोदी 2014 से अब तक अमेरिका 9 बार जा चुके हैं, और UAE, फ्रांस, जापान, रूस — हर एक देश का दौरा 5 बार कर चुके हैं.

कांग्रेस के दूसरे नेता और हैंडल्स भी मोदी के 2020 वाले नारे “अबकी बार, ट्रंप सरकार” को पोस्ट कर रहे हैं, जब ट्रंप दोबारा चुनाव लड़ रहे थे. अब ट्रंप भारत को लेकर रोज़ाना विवादास्पद दावे कर रहे हैं, और वो पुराना नारा मोदी सरकार के लिए गले की फांस बन गया है. कांग्रेस “विश्वगुरु” दावे को चोट पहुंचाना चाह रही है और यह पूछ रही है कि IMF की कार्यकारी बोर्ड बैठक में भारत ने पाकिस्तान के बेलआउट पैकेज के खिलाफ वोट क्यों नहीं किया, भारत किसी भी देश को इस बेलआउट के खिलाफ वोट देने के लिए मना नहीं पाया — यह बात विपक्ष के हाथ एक और मुद्दा दे रही है जिससे वह बीजेपी सरकार को घेर सके.

सरकार ने भी अपनी चाल चल दी है. 45 सांसदों और 6 वरिष्ठ नेताओं वाले सभी दलों के प्रतिनिधिमंडल की यात्रा — जो 33 देशों की राजधानियों में जाएंगे — विपक्ष के हमले की धार को कम करने की कोशिश है. इन प्रतिनिधिमंडलों में 19 विपक्षी नेता हैं — जिनमें से ज़्यादातर मुखर और तर्कशील माने जाते हैं. सोचिए, थरूर, तिवारी और कांग्रेस के तीन और नेता विदेशों में भारत की आतंकवाद के खिलाफ लड़ाई और सरकार के रुख का समर्थन करेंगे, जबकि देश में उनकी ही पार्टी सरकार को अंतरराष्ट्रीय समर्थन न मिल पाने के लिए कोस रही है.

इसलिए, जब भी संसद में इस पर बहस होगी, विपक्षी पार्टियों को मजबूरी में अपने उन सांसदों को इस मुद्दे पर नहीं उतारना पड़ेगा जो इन प्रतिनिधिमंडलों का हिस्सा थे.

बीजेपी का राजनीतिक खेल

ऑल पार्टी डेलिगेशन में कांग्रेस के साथ मोदी सरकार ने राजनीति की, ये तो ठीक है, लेकिन राजनीति में ऐसा होना आम बात है. सवाल ये है कि कांग्रेस इस चाल में फंसी क्यों? शशि थरूर और मनीष तिवारी जैसे नेता तो अपनी बात साफ-साफ कहने के लिए जाने जाते हैं, खासकर जब बात राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा की हो. उन्हें गांधी परिवार की तरह अल्पसंख्यक बहुल वायनाड जैसी सुरक्षित सीटें नहीं मिलतीं.

मनीष तिवारी ने तीन लोकसभा चुनाव तीन अलग-अलग सीटों से लड़े और हर बार जीते. थरूर ने 2009 में पहली बार तिरुवनंतपुरम से चुनाव लड़ा, जहां पहले दो बार कम्युनिस्ट पार्टी ऑफ इंडिया (CPI) जीत चुकी थी. उन्होंने तब से ये सीट लगातार बरकरार रखी है. ऐसे नेता जो हर दिन अपने क्षेत्र में पसीना बहाते हैं, उन्हें जनता की भावनाओं का ध्यान रखना होता है और उसी के हिसाब से जवाब देना होता है.

तो एक ओर जहां बीजेपी ने ऑल पार्टी डेलिगेशन के चयन में राजनीति की, वहीं मुख्य विपक्ष इतनी भोली निकली कि उस जाल में फंस गई. थरूर और तिवारी जैसे नेता अंतरराष्ट्रीय भू-राजनीतिक मंचों पर सम्मानित और प्रभावशाली आवाज़ें हैं. सलमान खुर्शीद तो पूर्व विदेश मंत्री रह चुके हैं. ये नेता कांग्रेस की तरफ से डेलिगेशन में नामित होने के स्वाभाविक विकल्प थे. फिर कांग्रेस ने इन्हें अपनी सूची से बाहर रखकर झटका क्यों दिया?

सीधा जवाब है—छोटापन और निजी स्वार्थ. राहुल गांधी और उनके परिवार के आसपास जो चापलूसों का एक गिरोह है, वही उन्हें असुरक्षित महसूस कराता है और सच्चाई नहीं देखने देता कि ये लोग अपने निजी स्वार्थ के लिए उनका इस्तेमाल कर रहे हैं.

कांग्रेस ने थरूर का अपमान किया

मैं यहां खुद को शशि थरूर और केरल की राजनीति तक सीमित रखूंगा. ये एक ऐसी स्थिति है जहां कांग्रेस पार्टी उन्हें सार्वजनिक रूप से अपमानित कर रही है. ज़रा सोचिए, पार्टी के राष्ट्रीय महासचिव (संचार) जयराम रमेश ने थरूर को लेकर एक के बाद एक टिप्पणी करके कैसे उनकी छवि को ठेस पहुंचाई. रमेश ने कहा कि थरूर जो भी बोलते हैं, वह उनका निजी विचार है, पार्टी का नहीं. रमेश की दूसरी टिप्पणियां भी देखिए: कांग्रेस में होने और कांग्रेस के होने में बड़ा फर्क है; कांग्रेस एक विशाल गंगा की तरह है, जिसकी कई सहायक नदियां हैं… कुछ सूख जाती हैं और कुछ प्रदूषित हो जाती हैं. तो फिर एक ‘प्रदूषित’ शशि थरूर को इस गंगा की सहायक नदी बने रहने की क्या जरूरत है? थरूर कहते हैं कि उन्हें आसानी से अपमानित नहीं किया जा सकता, लेकिन उनकी पार्टी उनकी सहनशीलता की परीक्षा ले रही है.

सबको पता है कि इस अपमान के पीछे कौन है. वो हैं केसी वेणुगोपाल, जो संगठन के महासचिव हैं और राहुल गांधी पर पूरा नियंत्रण रखते हैं. वेणुगोपाल की मुख्यमंत्री बनने की महत्वाकांक्षा किसी से छुपी नहीं है. इसलिए उन्हें हर संभावित प्रतिद्वंद्वी—सबसे बड़ा प्रतिद्वंद्वी थरूर—को रास्ते से हटाना है. वेणुगोपाल का राहुल गांधी पर पूरा असर जानते हुए, गांधी परिवार के करीबी हर नेता—मसलन, जयराम रमेश—थरूर की छवि खराब करने में लग जाता है. अब जब मोदी सरकार को इसमें मौका दिखा, तो उसने फायदा उठा लिया। तो फिर बीजेपी को दोष क्यों देना?

आइए, वापस चलते हैं उस समय में जब पंजाब के तत्कालीन मुख्यमंत्री कैप्टन अमरिंदर सिंह को 2022 विधानसभा चुनाव से पहले गांधी परिवार ने अपमानित किया—सिर्फ इसलिए कि वह ब्लू-ब्लडेड रॉयल, जो राजीव गांधी के स्कूल के दिनों के दोस्त थे, गांधी परिवार के बच्चों की चापलूसी नहीं कर पाए. गांधी भाई-बहन नवजोत सिद्धू से प्रभावित हो गए, जो बीजेपी छोड़कर कांग्रेस में आए थे. कांग्रेस पंजाब चुनाव हार गई, लेकिन गांधी परिवार जीत गया क्योंकि वह कैप्टन अमरिंदर सिंह के राजनीतिक संन्यास का कारण बना.

केरल में भी वैसा ही प्लॉट तैयार हो रहा है, क्योंकि राहुल गांधी केसी वेणुगोपाल के प्रति बेहद मोहग्रस्त हैं. कांग्रेस के नेता नहीं जानते कि ऐसा क्यों है, लेकिन थरूर को जाना ही होगा. हाईकमान ने अमरिंदर सिंह को इतना अपमानित किया कि उन्होंने इस्तीफा दे दिया और पार्टी छोड़ दी. अब केसी-जयराम एंड कंपनी थरूर के साथ भी वैसा ही कर रही है, ताकि वह भी जल्दी या देर से यही कदम उठाएं. पार्टी केरल में जीते या हारे—किसे फर्क पड़ता है?

थरूर के विकल्प

थरूर के पास क्या विकल्प हैं? उनके पास मुख्यमंत्री बनने की महत्वाकांक्षा है. क्यों न हो? एक चार बार के सांसद, जिनका केरल और देशभर में इतना फॉलोअर्स बेस है, उनके इस सपने को गलत नहीं कहा जा सकता. आखिरकार, वह ऐसे नेता हैं जिन्हें जाति की सीमाओं से परे युवा पसंद करते हैं. केरल की दो प्रमुख अल्पसंख्यक आबादी—ईसाई और मुस्लिम, जो कुल जनसंख्या का 45 प्रतिशत हैं—थरूर के उदार विचारों और सोच के कारण उन्हें पसंद करते हैं. नायर सर्विस सोसाइटी, जो केरल की दूसरी बड़ी समुदाय का प्रतिनिधित्व करने का दावा करती है, उन्हें अपनाने के लिए तैयार है.

वहीं, एझवा समुदाय, जो केरल का सबसे बड़ा हिंदू समुदाय है और परंपरागत रूप से वामपंथ के साथ रहा है, उसमें अब वफादारी बदलने के संकेत दिख रहे हैं. 2021 विधानसभा चुनावों के दौरान किए गए सीएसडीएस-लोकनीति के पोस्ट-पोल सर्वे के मुताबिक, 23 प्रतिशत एझवाओं ने एनडीए को वोट दिया—जो 2016 के 18 प्रतिशत से बढ़ा. 2024 लोकसभा चुनावों के पोस्ट-पोल सर्वे में, 32 प्रतिशत एझवाओं ने एनडीए को वोट दिया. यानी वामपंथी वोट पहले से ही बंट रहे हैं. जहां तक नायरों की बात है, 2021 विधानसभा चुनावों में बीजेपी को मिले उनके वोट 27 प्रतिशत थे, जो 2024 लोकसभा चुनावों में बढ़कर 45 प्रतिशत हो गए.

तो, जो लोग मानते हैं कि थरूर के पास बीजेपी में जाने का विकल्प नहीं है, वे गलत हैं. ये आंकड़े एक सच्चाई को सामने लाते हैं. देखिए 2024 लोकसभा चुनाव में तिरुवनंतपुरम सीट पर थरूर और उनके निकटतम प्रतिद्वंद्वी बीजेपी के राजीव चंद्रशेखर के बीच का अंतर—करीब 16,000 वोट. और इनमें से बड़ी संख्या में कांग्रेस के वोटर असल में थरूर के वोटर थे. तो जब कोई कहता है कि थरूर बीजेपी में नहीं जा सकते, तो सीधा सवाल बनता है—क्यों नहीं? उनकी संसदीय सीट सुरक्षित रहेगी. कांग्रेस तो उन्हें सीएम चेहरा बना नहीं रही. तो अगर वो बीजेपी के सीएम उम्मीदवार बनते हैं, तो उन्हें क्या नुकसान है?

संभावनाएं देखिए. पहला, बड़ी संख्या में हिंदू वोटर—जिनमें नायर और एझवा समुदाय के बहुत लोग पहले ही बीजेपी की ओर झुक रहे हैं—थरूर के साथ जा सकते हैं.

दूसरा, थरूर अल्पसंख्यकों में भी लोकप्रिय बने रह सकते हैं—जैसा कि बीजेपी के सफल त्रिशूर उम्मीदवार सुरेश गोपी के मामले में हुआ.

इससे खेल खुलता है. मैं ये बिल्कुल नहीं कह रहा कि थरूर बीजेपी में जा रहे हैं। मैं केवल एक काल्पनिक स्थिति की बात कर रहा हूं. अगर वो कांग्रेस छोड़ने का फैसला करते हैं—जैसा कि केसी वेणुगोपाल और जयराम रमेश उन्हें बाहर निकालने की पूरी कोशिश कर रहे हैं—तो उनके पास कई विकल्प हैं. वामपंथ भी उन्हें गले लगा सकता है. मुझे याद है जब 2006 में वो दिल्ली में सीपीआई-एम मुख्यालय एकेजी भवन आए थे.

तब वो चाहते थे कि भारत उन्हें संयुक्त राष्ट्र महासचिव पद के लिए समर्थन दे और उस समय वामदलों की सरकार में बड़ी भूमिका थी. मुझे आज भी याद है कि वहां के कॉमरेड्स उस दौरे से कितने उत्साहित थे।. हाल ही में नियुक्त सीपीआई (एम) महासचिव एमए बेबी ने कहा है कि मुख्यमंत्री पिनराई विजयन, जो 79 साल के हैं, 2026 के चुनाव प्रचार का नेतृत्व करेंगे, लेकिन अगर वामपंथ फिर से जीता तो मुख्यमंत्री चुनाव के बाद तय होगा. मतलब, विजयन अगली बार जरूरी नहीं कि सीएम बनें. तो क्या थरूर के पास वामपंथ में अपना सपना पूरा करने का विकल्प है? वो उन्हें जरूर अपनाना चाहेंगे. लेकिन एक गैर-कॉमरेड के लिए उस अहम पद तक पहुंचना मुश्किल है. केसी वेणुगोपाल वाली कांग्रेस तो उन्हें वैसे भी यह मौका नहीं देगी. इसलिए अगर थरूर को अपने सपनों को हकीकत में बदलना है और राज्य के लिए अपना विजन लागू करना है, तो बीजेपी एक विकल्प बनती है—खासतौर पर जब राहुल गांधी एंड कंपनी उन्हें बाहर निकालने में कोई कसर नहीं छोड़ रही है.

थरूर को जरूर याद होगा कि गांधी परिवार ने कैसे कैप्टन अमरिंदर सिंह को रोज़-रोज़ छोटे-छोटे कट मारकर खत्म कर दिया था, उन्हें हर रोज़ अपमानित किया गया. जैसा कि दिख रहा है, गांधी परिवार केरल विधानसभा चुनाव में पंजाब दोहराने की तैयारी कर रहा है, जो अगले साल की शुरुआत में होने हैं.

बिलकुल साफ़-सुथरे सफेद यूनिफॉर्म में कतारों में खड़े बच्चे पूरी इज़्ज़त से चुपचाप सुन रहे थे: “अगर एक भी लड़का अनपढ़ रह जाए, तो वह हमारी ही हार है, हम यह जानते हैं,” तहरीक-ए-तालिबान के कमांडर ने कहा, अपनी ऑटोमैटिक राइफल को ढीले से हाथ में पकड़े हुए, “लेकिन सरकार हमारी औरतों और बच्चों को मार रही है, और हम इसे अपनी बस्तियों में रहने नहीं दे सकते। यह स्कूल बंद होना ही चाहिए.” एक शिक्षक ने हल्के से विरोध किया. “मैं खुद इसी स्कूल में पढ़ा हूं,” कमांडर ने जवाब दिया, “इसलिए मैं खुद इज्ज़त से यह संदेश देने आया हूं. नहीं तो मेरे पास चार ड्रोन हैं, जो भेज सकता था.”

7 मई से शुरू हुई भारत और पाकिस्तान के बीच 100 घंटे की लड़ाई के अंगारों के अब भी जलते रहने के बीच, टीटीपी का खैबर पख्तूनख्वा के अशांत उत्तर वज़ीरिस्तान इलाके में स्कूल बंद कराने का अभियान यह याद दिलाता है कि पाकिस्तान अंदरूनी जंग भी लड़ रहा है. खैबर पख्तूनख्वा के बड़े हिस्सों में राज्य की सत्ता का नियंत्रण लगभग खत्म हो चुका है. दक्षिण में, बलूचिस्तान में, उग्रवादी अब भी हाइवे रोकते हैं और सरकारी सुरक्षाबलों पर हमले करते हैं.

कमजोर राष्ट्र-राज्यों की अपनी एक खास सोच होती है. इस हफ्ते, पाकिस्तान की सेना के जनरल भारत से मिसाइल के खतरे या सिंधु जल संधि से देश को होने वाले आर्थिक नुकसान पर चर्चा नहीं कर रहे होंगे. ये वे मुद्दे हैं, जिन्हें गठबंधन बनाकर या देश की भौगोलिक स्थिति के आधार पर मदद मांगकर सुलझाया जा सकता है. वे यह सोच रहे होंगे कि इस संकट ने कश्मीर में छद्म युद्ध को और बढ़ाने के लिए कितना नया मौका दिया है.

पीढ़ियों से, भारतीय रणनीतिकार जो सर्जिकल या दंडात्मक कार्रवाई करते रहे हैं, वे इस सोच के साथ काम करते रहे कि सीमा पार के जनरल भी उन्हीं की तरह सोचते हैं — यानी तर्कसंगत तरीके से जो दर्द का अनुमानित जवाब देंगे. लेकिन जैसा कि दिप्रिंट के संपादक शेखर गुप्ता ने बताया है, भारत की पहले की ऐसी कार्रवाइयों से सिर्फ कश्मीर में थोड़े समय के लिए ही हालात सुधरे हैं. यह नतीजा किसी भी मजबूत डर पैदा करने वाली रणनीति से काफी कमज़ोर रहा है.

अपने पूर्ववर्तियों की तरह, पाकिस्तान सेना प्रमुख जनरल असीम मुनीर उस कट्टरपंथी विचारधारा से बने सैन्य-राज्य के संरक्षक हैं, जिसे “पाकिस्तान की विचारधारा” कहा जाता है और जो इस्लामी सोच पर आधारित है. “कश्मीर के लिए तीन युद्ध लड़े जा चुके हैं, और अगर दस और लड़ने पड़ें तो हम लड़ेंगे, इंशा अल्लाह,” जनरल मुनीर ने इस साल की शुरुआत में कहा था. “अल्लाह का दल हमेशा ईमान, परहेज़गारी और जिहाद के दम पर जीतता है.” भारत के साथ अंतहीन जंग किसी लक्ष्य को हासिल करने का ज़रिया नहीं है — बल्कि यही जंग खुद उस राज्य के अस्तित्व को बनाए रखने का माध्यम बन गई है.

डर पैदा करने का गणित

1947-1948 के कश्मीर युद्ध, हैदराबाद में निज़ाम की हार और जूनागढ़ को न बचा पाने से पाकिस्तान की रणनीतिक सोच रखने वाले लोगों ने एक उल्टा सबक सीखा: अपनी कमजोरी का हल मेलजोल में नहीं, बल्कि अपने पूर्वी पड़ोसी को लगातार नुकसान पहुंचाने की योजना में है.

100 घंटे के युद्ध को अभी बस एक हफ्ता ही हुआ है, इसलिए कोई ठोस नतीजा निकालना मुश्किल है. स्वतंत्र विश्लेषणों के मुताबिक, इस लड़ाई की शुरुआत में भारत ने कम से कम दो फाइटर जेट खोए, और शायद पांच तक, जिनमें एक राफेल, एक सुखोई-30 और एक मिग-29 शामिल हैं. भारत ने पहले ही बता दिया था कि वह केवल आतंकवाद से जुड़े ठिकानों पर हमला करेगा. फ्रांसीसी विश्लेषक फेब्रिस वुल्फ ने सुझाव दिया है कि पाकिस्तान एयरफोर्स ने लंबी दूरी की मिसाइलों का इस्तेमाल करके उन भारतीय विमानों को निशाना बनाया जो अब भी सीमा के भारतीय हिस्से में थे.

इस पहले चरण के बाद, भारत ने ड्रोन हमलों की लहरों को सफलतापूर्वक रोका और फिर पाकिस्तान के अंदर कम से कम छह अहम एयरफील्ड्स को सटीक मिसाइलों से निशाना बनाया, जैसा कि सैटेलाइट तस्वीरों से पता चलता है—ये हमले नुकसान के लिए नहीं, बल्कि यह दिखाने के लिए थे कि भारत पाकिस्तान के अंदर गहराई तक जाकर सैन्य ढांचे को ठप कर सकता है.

इस संकट के असर को केवल हुए नुकसान से मापना बेकार है. जैसा कि सोवियत जनरल एंड्रियन डानिलेविच ने कहा था, “अगर युद्ध की कला को अंकगणित में बदला जा सकता, तो युद्ध की ज़रूरत ही न होती.” जनरल यह दिखा चुके हैं कि वे नुकसान झेलकर भी आगे बढ़ सकते हैं.

अतीत से यह साफ है कि भारत की ताकत दिखाने से हासिल फायदे बहुत अस्थायी रहे हैं. कारगिल में जीत के बाद कश्मीर में हिंसा बढ़ गई, जिसमें युद्ध से ज़्यादा लोग मारे गए. 2001-2002 के संकट के बाद शांति प्रक्रिया शुरू तो हुई, लेकिन फिर 26/11 और 2006, 2010, 2012, और 2016 के आंदोलन हुए. 2016 की एलओसी पार स्ट्राइक के जवाब में कई फिदायीन हमले हुए; 2019 की बालाकोट स्ट्राइक के बाद भी भारतीय सैनिकों पर हमले नहीं रुके.

यह एक सीधा सवाल उठाता है: फिर पाकिस्तान को क्या चीज़ रोक सकती है?

भूतिया सेनाओं से मुकाबला

पाकिस्तान को आतंकवादी समूहों का समर्थन करने से कैसे रोका जाए, यह समस्या न तो नई है और न ही सिर्फ भारत तक सीमित है. जब अफगानिस्तान में हथियारों और लड़ाकों की बढ़ती आमद हुई, तो केंद्रीय खुफिया एजेंसी के दस्तावेज़ों से पता चलता है कि सोवियत संघ ने 1985-1986 में मुजाहिदीन और पाकिस्तान सेना की सीमा चौकियों पर हवाई हमले तेज कर दिए. 1986 के पहले छह महीनों में, सीआईए ने दर्ज किया कि सोवियत हवाई घुसपैठ पाकिस्तान में लगभग 500 बार हुई — जो पिछले साल की तुलना में दोगुनी थी.

हालांकि अमेरिका ने पाकिस्तान की हवाई सुरक्षा मजबूत करने के लिए अत्याधुनिक सतह से हवा में मार करने वाली मिसाइलें दीं, लेकिन सोवियत पायलट इन खतरों से बचने में माहिर थे. 1985 के मध्य से, इस्लामाबाद के पास मौजूद स्टिंगर, रेडआई और क्रोटाले मिसाइल सिस्टम नियमित रूप से दुश्मन के विमानों को मार गिराने में सफल हुए. पाकिस्तान का दावा है कि उसके एफ-16 विमानों ने 10 सोवियत विमानों को गिराया; हालांकि, सोवियत अभिलेखों के अनुसार, उन्होंने तीन Su-22, एक Su-25 और एक An-26 ट्रांसपोर्ट विमान खोए.

लेखक लेस्टर डब्ल्यू ग्रौ और अली अहमद जलाली ने दर्ज किया है कि सोवियत विशेष बलों ने लड़ाई को पाकिस्तान की सीमा में ले जाकर, मीरानशाह से चलने वाली जिहादी सप्लाई लाइन को बाधित करने के लिए ज़हावर में मुजाहिदीन के अड्डों को नष्ट कर दिया. अप्रैल 1986 में ज़हावर की गुफा प्रणाली पर कब्जा कर लिया गया. सोवियत विशेष बलों — स्पेट्सनाज़ — ने कुनार नदी पार कर केरेर में भी हमला किया. प्रसिद्ध हिल 3234 की लड़ाई में, 1988 में सोवियत सेना की 345वीं स्वतंत्र गार्ड यूनिट के केवल 39 पैराट्रूपर्स ने कई दिनों तक मुजाहिदीन और पाकिस्तानी विशेष बलों के संगठित हमलों को रोके रखा.

दबाव बढ़ाने के लिए, अफगान खुफिया एजेंसी खदमात-ए-इतलात-ए-दौलती ने पाकिस्तान में बम धमाकों की मुहिम तेज कर दी. 1986 में पाकिस्तान इंटरनेशनल एयरलाइंस के दफ्तर में हुआ धमाका इस बात का संकेत था कि सोवियत संघ सीमा पार भी नुकसान पहुंचाने के लिए तैयार है. यह तरीका हवाई हमलों की तुलना में सस्ता था, लेकिन मुजाहिदीन के ढांचे को उतना नुकसान नहीं पहुंचा पाया.

खदमात-ए-इतलात-ए-दौलती ने कबीलाई और जातीय असंतोष को भी भड़काया और वली खान कुकिखेल जैसे नशीली दवाओं के तस्कर के साथ मिलकर अफरीदी जैसे गुटों को आईएसआई के खिलाफ करने की कोशिश की. ये प्रयास क्षणिक साबित हुए, क्योंकि ये कबीलें अक्सर पाला बदल लेते थे, लेकिन इससे संघर्ष अफगान सीमा के पार खैबर पख्तूनख्वा तक पहुंच गया.

हालांकि यह लंबा थकाऊ अभियान पाकिस्तान द्वारा मुजाहिदीन को दी जा रही मदद को खत्म करने में नाकाम रहा, जिसे पश्चिमी देश समर्थन दे रहे थे. अमू दरिया नदी के पार से सेना हटाने से पहले ही, सोवियत संघ को यह एहसास हो गया था कि इस अभियान की लागत अफगानिस्तान के रणनीतिक महत्व से कहीं अधिक है.

जैसे बाद में अमेरिका को भी यह सिखाया गया, वैसे ही सोवियत संघ ने यह सबक सीखा: लंबे वैचारिक युद्धों में जीत उसी की होती है जो धैर्य रखता है, न कि केवल वह जो लड़ाई जीतता है.

कश्मीर में जीत

जबकि भारतीय रणनीतिकार अगले आतंकवादी हमलों को रोकने के तरीके सोच रहे हैं, कश्मीर के भीतर कुछ तात्कालिक चुनौतियां सामने हैं. चाहे हमें पसंद हो या नहीं, पाकिस्तान की सेना ने यह दिखा दिया है कि वह लड़ने के लिए तैयार है. इससे कश्मीर में पाकिस्तान समर्थक विचारधारा को एक बार फिर से उम्मीद मिली है. इस लड़ाई को जीतने के लिए भारत को एक बहुत ही स्पष्ट रणनीति की जरूरत है, जिससे राजनीतिक व्यवस्था की वैधता को मजबूत किया जा सके. इससे भी ज़्यादा ज़रूरी बात यह है कि नई दिल्ली को उन गहरे डर का समाधान करना होगा, जो हिंदू सांप्रदायिकता को लेकर कश्मीर की सांस्कृतिक सोच में अब भी मौजूद हैं.

सरकार को जम्मू और कश्मीर में पुलिसिंग में आई कमजोरी से भी निपटना होगा. पिछले हफ्ते मारे गए छह जातीय कश्मीरी आतंकवादियों में से चार कई वर्षों से सक्रिय थे, जो यह दिखाता है कि स्थानीय खुफिया जानकारी में कमी आ गई है. इसका संबंध प्रशिक्षण, मनोबल और नेतृत्व से जुड़ी समस्याओं से है, जो 2019 में जम्मू और कश्मीर पुलिस कैडर को बंद करने के गलत फैसले से पैदा हुई हैं.

आख़िर में, भारत को खुद की उस आदत पर लगाम लगानी होगी, जो हर हिंसा की घटना के बाद बिना सोचे-समझे जवाबी कार्रवाई में दिखती है—जैसे पहलगाम के बाद घरों को तोड़ना और बिना किसी ठोस कारण के गिरफ्तारियां करना. भारत ने जम्मू-कश्मीर में उग्रवाद को लगभग खत्म कर दिया है. पिछले साल, भारतीय सेना पर कई बार हमले होने के बावजूद, केवल 26 सुरक्षा कर्मियों की मौत हुई—जो 2012 के बाद सबसे कम संख्या है. आम नागरिकों की मौतें भी पिछले पच्चीस वर्षों में सबसे कम रही हैं.

सच है कि पाकिस्तान अब भी पहलगाम जैसे राजनीतिक रूप से नुकसान पहुंचाने वाले हमलों या भारतीय शहरों में आतंकी बम धमाकों की क्षमता रखता है—लेकिन भारत के पास यह तय करने का विकल्प है कि उसे कैसे जवाब देना है. भले ही आतंकवादियों और उनके समर्थकों को सज़ा देना ज़रूरी है, भारत को यह याद रखना चाहिए कि उसका आख़िरी लक्ष्य पाकिस्तान से लड़ना नहीं, बल्कि कश्मीर को जीतना है.

चेन्नई: तमिलनाडु की पट्टाली मक्कल काच्ची (पीएमके) के संस्थापक और उनके बेटे के बीच चल रहे विवाद ने पार्टी कार्यकर्ताओं के बीच तनाव बढ़ा दिया है और 2026 विधानसभा चुनाव से पहले पार्टी में फूट पड़ने का डर पैदा कर दिया है, जब तक कि कोई समाधान जल्द नहीं निकाला जाता.

हालांकि पार्टी नेतृत्व का कहना है कि सब कुछ ठीक है, लेकिन पीएमके कार्यकर्ताओं को डर है कि अगर एस. रामदास और उनके बेटे अंबुमणि के बीच मतभेद 2026 विधानसभा चुनाव तक चलते रहे, तो पार्टी टूट सकती है.

“हम नहीं चाहते कि ऐसा हो. लेकिन बाप-बेटे के बीच का यह झगड़ा जल्द खत्म होता नहीं दिख रहा, क्योंकि अंबुमणि तो रामदास से बात करने तक को तैयार नहीं हैं,” एक वरिष्ठ अंबुमणि नेता ने बताया, जो 1989 में रामदास के नेतृत्व में पार्टी में शामिल हुए थे.

ताजा विवाद अप्रैल में उस समय सामने आया जब रामदास ने विल्लुपुरम जिले के थैलापुरम स्थित अपने फार्महाउस में जिला स्तरीय पदाधिकारियों की बैठक बुलाई. 220 पदाधिकारियों में से केवल 13 ही इस बैठक में शामिल हुए, जिससे यह साफ हो गया कि अधिकांश पदाधिकारी अंबुमणि के पक्ष में हैं.

पार्टी की कोषाध्यक्ष एम. तिलगपामा, जो अंबुमणि की कट्टर समर्थक मानी जाती हैं, ने आरोप लगाया कि रामदास को कुछ वरिष्ठ नेताओं, खासकर पीएमके के मानद अध्यक्ष जी.के. मणि द्वारा गुमराह किया जा रहा है.

“आयु अधिक हो जाने के कारण अय्या (रामदास) अब पार्टी में हो रही हर चीज़ पर ध्यान नहीं दे पा रहे हैं. जी.के. मणि जैसे लोग इसका फायदा उठा रहे हैं और उन्हें गुमराह कर रहे हैं,” तिलगपामा ने दिप्रिंट से कहा.

1989 में बनी इस पार्टी का मुख्य आधार वन्नियार समुदाय है, जो राज्य में एक अति पिछड़ा वर्ग (MBC) है.

बाप-बेटे के बीच तनाव पहली बार 28 दिसंबर 2024 को विल्लुपुरम में हुई पार्टी की आम परिषद बैठक के दौरान सामने आया था, जब रामदास की बड़ी बेटी गांधीमति के बेटे पी. मुकुंदन को पार्टी की युवा इकाई का अध्यक्ष बनाने को लेकर विवाद हुआ.

विवाद उस समय और बढ़ गया जब रामदास ने 10 अप्रैल को अपने बेटे को पार्टी अध्यक्ष पद से हटा दिया और उन्हें कार्यकारी अध्यक्ष बना दिया.

रामदास ने खुद को पार्टी अध्यक्ष घोषित कर दिया और कहा कि जी.के. मणि मानद अध्यक्ष बने रहेंगे.

यह घटनाक्रम उस दिन से ठीक एक दिन पहले हुआ जब भाजपा के वरिष्ठ नेता और गृहमंत्री अमित शाह ने तमिलनाडु का दौरा किया और 11 अप्रैल को ऑल इंडिया अन्ना द्रविड़ मुनेत्र कड़गम (AIADMK) के साथ गठबंधन को फिर से शुरू करने की घोषणा की.

इस घटनाक्रम से जुड़ी जानकारी रखने वाले पार्टी सूत्रों ने दिप्रिंट को बताया कि रामदास चुनाव से एक साल पहले किसी भी गठबंधन की घोषणा के पक्ष में नहीं थे, क्योंकि इससे पार्टी की सौदेबाज़ी की ताकत कम हो जाती.

हालांकि पीएमके ने पिछले साल लोकसभा चुनावों में भाजपा के नेतृत्व वाले एनडीए के साथ हाथ मिलाया था, पार्टी ने कहा है कि वह 2026 के विधानसभा चुनाव के लिए गठबंधन पर फैसला अगले साल लेगी.

ऊपर उद्धृत वरिष्ठ नेता ने दिप्रिंट को बताया कि रामदास राष्ट्रीय दलों के साथ गठबंधन के पक्ष में नहीं थे, क्योंकि यह उनके सिद्धांतों के खिलाफ था.

“वह हमेशा चाहते थे कि राज्य में पैठ जमाने के लिए किसी एक द्रविड़ दल के साथ हाथ मिलाया जाए. उन्हीं की रणनीति के कारण एक समय में पीएमके का उत्तरी जिलों में वोट शेयर 10 प्रतिशत से अधिक था,” उस वरिष्ठ नेता ने कहा.

“यह पिछले विधानसभा चुनाव में घटकर 5 प्रतिशत से भी कम रह गया,” नेता ने आगे कहा.

जी.के. मणि ने दिप्रिंट से कहा कि यह मुद्दा आपसी सहमति से सुलझा लिया जाएगा.

मणि ने कहा, “हमारे डॉक्टर अय्या और चिन्नैया अंबुमणि जल्द ही आमने-सामने मिलेंगे और सब कुछ पर चर्चा करेंगे. यह पार्टी का आंतरिक मामला है और जल्द ही सब कुछ ठीक हो जाएगा. यह अफवाह थी कि हमारे अय्या (रामदास) सभी जिला सचिवों से साइन लेकर अंबुमणि को पार्टी से निकालने वाले हैं, लेकिन यह सच नहीं है.”

2026 का विधानसभा चुनाव पीएमके के लिए अहम

राजनीतिक विश्लेषक रविंद्रन दुरईसामी ने दिप्रिंट से कहा कि यह विवाद तब ज्यादा चर्चा में आया जब पार्टी को विधानसभा चुनाव में एक अहम परीक्षा का सामना करना पड़ रहा है.

रविंद्रन ने कहा, “आगामी 2026 का चुनाव पीएमके के लिए बहुत अहम है और यह पार्टी के अस्तित्व की लड़ाई है, क्योंकि उत्तर तमिलनाडु में उसका वोट शेयर कम हो गया है.”

उन्होंने आगे कहा, “पीएमके ने 1991 से डीएमके (द्रविड़ मुनेत्र कड़गम) के वोटों में सेंध लगाकर अपना वोट बैंक बनाया था, लेकिन अब उसने अपना वोट शेयर AIADMK को दे दिया है.”

रविंद्रन के मुताबिक, AIADMK द्वारा एमबीसी कोटे में वन्नियारों के लिए 10.5 प्रतिशत आरक्षण देने का फैसला — जिसे बाद में मद्रास हाईकोर्ट ने रद्द कर दिया — वन्नियार समुदाय की निष्ठा को AIADMK की ओर मोड़ने वाला कदम साबित हुआ.

“अगर पार्टी को अपना खोया हुआ वोट शेयर वापस पाना है, तो उसे वन्नियार समुदाय के बीच मजबूती से काम करना होगा और एनडीए गठबंधन से अलग होना होगा. अगर वह एनडीए में बनी रहती है, तो गठबंधन की दूसरी पार्टियां पीएमके का वोट शेयर खा जाएंगी,” रविंद्रन ने कहा.

हालांकि, राजनीतिक विश्लेषक एन. सत्य मूर्ति ने कहा कि यह विवाद राजनीतिक रणनीति में एक पीढ़ीगत बदलाव को दिखाता है.

“हालांकि अंबुमणि रामदास के बेटे हैं और उन्होंने अपने पिता की गठबंधन रणनीति को करीब से देखा है, लेकिन अब वे आखिरी वक्त में गठबंधन तय करने की पुरानी परंपरा को मानने को तैयार नहीं हैं,” सत्य मूर्ति ने कहा.

“चूंकि वीसीके, डीएमके गठबंधन के साथ है, इसलिए पीएमके के पास AIADMK के नेतृत्व वाले राष्ट्रीय जनतांत्रिक गठबंधन (NDA) में शामिल होने के अलावा कोई विकल्प नहीं है. इसलिए अंबुमणि चाहते हैं कि गठबंधन की घोषणा की पहल वे खुद करें. लेकिन रामदास इस पर संकोच कर रहे हैं ताकि सौदेबाजी की ताकत बढ़ाई जा सके, जिसे अंबुमणि शायद बेकार मानते हैं,” उन्होंने जोड़ा.

पीएमके का चुनावी प्रदर्शन

डॉ. रामदास, जो एक प्रैक्टिस करने वाले डॉक्टर हैं, 1980 में सार्वजनिक जीवन में तब आए जब उन्होंने वन्नियार संगम की स्थापना की, जो वन्नियार संगठनों का एक गठबंधन था.

रामदास के नेतृत्व में वन्नियार संगम ने 1987 में बड़े स्तर पर प्रदर्शन किए, जिसमें वन्नियार जाति को अति पिछड़ा वर्ग (एमबीसी) का दर्जा देने की मांग की गई. इस आंदोलन को मिले समर्थन को देखते हुए उन्होंने 1989 में पट्टाली मक्कल काच्ची (पीएमके) की स्थापना की.

पार्टी ने पहली बार 1991 के विधानसभा चुनाव में हिस्सा लिया, जहां उसने 194 सीटों पर चुनाव लड़ा और सिर्फ एक सीट जीत पाई. उस समय पार्टी को लगभग 5.89 प्रतिशत वोट मिले.

1996 में पार्टी ने तीसरा मोर्चा बनाकर लगभग 116 सीटों पर चुनाव लड़ा, जिसमें उसे करीब चार सीटें मिलीं और वोट शेयर लगभग 5.4 प्रतिशत रहा.

2001 में पहली बार पार्टी ने AIADMK के साथ गठबंधन किया और 27 सीटों पर चुनाव लड़ा. इसमें उसने 20 सीटें जीतीं और 5.56 प्रतिशत वोट शेयर हासिल किया. 2006 में पीएमके ने डीएमके के साथ गठबंधन किया और 31 सीटों पर चुनाव लड़ा. लेकिन वह केवल 18 सीटें ही जीत पाई और वोट शेयर 5.39 प्रतिशत रहा.

2011 में पीएमके ने डीएमके गठबंधन में रहकर 30 सीटों पर चुनाव लड़ा, लेकिन सिर्फ तीन सीटें जीत पाई. तब भी पार्टी का वोट शेयर 5.23 प्रतिशत रहा. 2016 में पार्टी ने अकेले 234 सीटों पर चुनाव लड़ा, लेकिन पूरी तरह हार गई. तब भी वोट शेयर 5.36 प्रतिशत रहा.

2021 में पीएमके ने एनडीए गठबंधन के साथ मिलकर 23 सीटों पर चुनाव लड़ा, जिसमें उसने पांच सीटें जीतीं और वोट शेयर 3.80 प्रतिशत रहा.

नई दिल्ली: अमेरिका ने सोमवार को भारतीय ट्रैवल एजेंसियों के मालिकों, अधिकारियों और वरिष्ठ कर्मचारियों पर वीजा प्रतिबंध लगाए हैं. उन पर यह आरोप है कि उन्होंने जानबूझकर अवैध इमिग्रेशन को बढ़ावा दिया. यह कदम मानव तस्करी नेटवर्क को रोकने के उद्देश्य से उठाया गया है.

अमेरिकी विदेश विभाग की एक अधिसूचना में कहा गया है कि भारत में उसकी राजनयिक और वाणिज्यिक टीमें ऐसे लोगों की पहचान कर रही हैं और उन्हें जिम्मेदार ठहरा रही हैं जो अमेरिका में बिना अनुमति के प्रवास को बढ़ावा दे रहे हैं.

उनके बयान में कहा गया, “हम ट्रैवल एजेंसियों के मालिकों, अधिकारियों और वरिष्ठ कर्मचारियों पर वीजा प्रतिबंध लगाना जारी रखेंगे ताकि मानव तस्करी नेटवर्क को खत्म किया जा सके.”

यह कदम अंतरराष्ट्रीय इमिग्रेशन नेटवर्क के खिलाफ एक बड़े अभियान का हिस्सा है, जिनके बारे में अमेरिकी अधिकारियों का दावा है कि वे देश की कानून व्यवस्था और राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा को कमजोर कर रहे हैं. विदेश विभाग ने कहा कि वीजा प्रतिबंध “मानव तस्करी नेटवर्क को खत्म” करेंगे या कम से कम एक चेतावनी के रूप में काम करेंगे.

इस साल अप्रैल में, भारत में अमेरिकी दूतावास ने धोखाधड़ी की आशंका के चलते 2,000 वीजा अपॉइंटमेंट रद्द कर दिए थे. अब वह ट्रैवल एजेंटों द्वारा वीजा अपॉइंटमेंट सिस्टम के दुरुपयोग की जांच का दायरा बढ़ा रहा है.

दिप्रिंट की एक जांच के अनुसार, अमेरिकी दूतावास न केवल ऐसे धोखाधड़ी में शामिल वीजा आवेदकों को ब्लैकलिस्ट करने की योजना बना रहा है, बल्कि उनके नाम यूके, कनाडा और ऑस्ट्रेलिया सहित अन्य सहयोगी देशों के साथ साझा करेगा.

वित्तीय वर्ष 2024 (अक्टूबर 2023 से सितंबर 2024) के दौरान, भारत में अमेरिकी मिशनों, जिनमें नई दिल्ली का दूतावास और चेन्नई, हैदराबाद, मुंबई और कोलकाता के वाणिज्य दूतावास शामिल हैं, ने लगभग 13.8 लाख वीजा जारी किए। इनमें से 9 लाख टूरिस्ट वीजा थे—जो अब तक का रिकॉर्ड है.

हालांकि, दिप्रिंट की रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, अमेरिका वीजा की मांग में तेज़ी ने एक ब्लैक मार्केट को जन्म दिया है, जहां कुछ ट्रैवल एजेंट तेज़ अपॉइंटमेंट स्लॉट के लिए ₹60,000 तक चार्ज करते हैं.

डॉनल्ड ट्रंप के नेतृत्व वाले प्रशासन ने इस संकट पर सख्त रुख अपनाया है और अमेरिकी मिशनों को ट्रैवल एजेंटों के अलावा सीधे वीजा आवेदकों के खिलाफ भी कार्रवाई करने का अधिकार दिया है. यह नीति पहले की उस नीति से अलग है, जो केवल बिचौलियों पर कार्रवाई तक सीमित थी.

विदेश विभाग की प्रवक्ता टैमी ब्रूस ने बयान में कहा, “हमारी इमिग्रेशन नीति का उद्देश्य न केवल विदेशी नागरिकों को अमेरिका में अवैध प्रवास के खतरों के बारे में जागरूक करना है, बल्कि उन लोगों को भी जिम्मेदार ठहराना है जो हमारे कानूनों का उल्लंघन करते हैं, जिनमें अवैध इमिग्रेशन को बढ़ावा देने वाले शामिल हैं.”

यह घोषणा उस समय आई है जब इमिग्रेशन प्रवर्तन पर—खासकर दक्षिणपंथी राजनीतिक समूहों के बीच—फिर से ध्यान केंद्रित हुआ है. इन समूहों का मानना है कि अवैध प्रवास बढ़ने से कानून-व्यवस्था की स्थिति बिगड़ रही है.

हालांकि, किन व्यक्तियों पर वीजा प्रतिबंध लगाए गए हैं, यह अमेरिकी अधिकारियों ने उजागर नहीं किया. मीडिया से बातचीत में अमेरिकी दूतावास ने कहा कि वह “वीजा रिकॉर्ड की गोपनीयता” के कारण नाम नहीं बता सकते.

यह घटनाक्रम उन भारतीय नागरिकों की हालिया वापसी के बाद सामने आया है जो कथित तौर पर अमेरिका में अवैध रूप से रह रहे थे. इस साल फरवरी में, अमेरिका ने लगभग 330 भारतीय नागरिकों को वापस भेजा था. भारत ने पिछले महीने अमेरिकी उपराष्ट्रपति जेडी वेंस की यात्रा के दौरान इस मुद्दे पर चर्चा की थी.

विदेश मंत्री एस. जयशंकर के नेतृत्व वाले विदेश मंत्रालय ने भी चिंता जताई है कि जिन भारतीय नागरिकों पर वीजा प्रतिबंध लगाए गए हैं, उनमें से 50 प्रतिशत छात्र हैं.

अप्रैल में, विदेश मंत्रालय ने संसद को बताया था कि भारतीय अधिकारी नियमित रूप से अमेरिकी अधिकारियों के साथ प्रवास मुद्दों पर बातचीत करते हैं, जिनमें मंत्री स्तर की बैठकें भी शामिल हैं. मंत्रालय ने कहा कि उसका ध्यान दो बातों पर है—अवैध चैनलों पर सख्ती और टूरिस्ट्स, छात्रों और पेशेवरों के लिए कानूनी आवागमन को आसान बनाना.

प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी ने भी इसी दोहरे दृष्टिकोण को इस साल फरवरी में वाशिंगटन डीसी की यात्रा के दौरान रेखांकित किया था, जब भारत और अमेरिका ने “सुरक्षित और आपसी लाभदायक आवागमन ढांचे” के निर्माण के लिए अपनी प्रतिबद्धता दोहराई थी, और वैश्विक कार्यबल की बदलती प्रकृति को मान्यता दी थी.

इस साल की शुरुआत में, मोदी सरकार ने अवैध प्रवास का विरोध दोहराया था, यह कहते हुए कि इसका संगठित अपराध से संबंध है. नई दिल्ली ने यह भी कहा था कि वह अमेरिका में ऐसे सभी भारतीय नागरिकों की वापसी के लिए तैयार है, जिन्होंने या तो अपना वीजा पार कर लिया है या बिना दस्तावेजों के वहां रह रहे हैं.

तब विदेश मंत्रालय के प्रवक्ता रंधीर जायसवाल ने कहा था कि भारत ट्रंप प्रशासन के साथ मिलकर अवैध प्रवास के मुद्दों को सुलझाने के लिए सहयोग को तैयार है.
